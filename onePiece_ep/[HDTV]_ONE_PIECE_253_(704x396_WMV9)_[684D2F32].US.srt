1
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:21,283
Among all the human lives of this world…

2
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,683
It is you six whom eille chose.

3
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,683
Robin, get out of the train!

4
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,883
One will fight against no matter whom!

5
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,350
Wait!

6
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:56,683
ROBIN!!!

7
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:25,816
One did not arrive in time…

8
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:38,250
SANJI ENTERS BY EFFRACTION!
The STORMY BATTAILLE OF UMI RESSHA!

9
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:51,065
Whore, but what it wanted this type?

10
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:55,665
It does not matter its intentions, after all
it is a train reserved for the government.

11
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,000
If it is made take, it will be cooked.

12
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,466
Hein? It is the type of Galley it…

13
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,333
Paul…

14
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,666
Reflected before acting.

15
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,933
It would seem that they are separating.

16
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,865
The station is a place where meetings
and separations are currency.

17
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:20,600
And it is our duty, with us the controllers,
to watch for all that discreetly.

18
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
Yes, it is true.

19
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,733
Discreetly.

20
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,532
It left bloody in advance.

21
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,800
Roasted!

22
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,200
Ah yes!

23
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:39,000
All the passengers were already on board…

24
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:43,465
And the sea was very agitated…

25
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:47,799
This is why they thought that
Aqua Laguna was going to arrive earlier than envisaged,

26
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,066
and they thus have advanced the hour of the departure.

27
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,000
They is dangerous to remain here.

28
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:58,066
It would be preferable to join
shelters of the high city.

29
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,266
That is also worth for this lady.

30
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,733
Ah yes.

31
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,200
Hey, you.

32
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,600
One cannot stop a train which already left.

33
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,066
It is difficult to say…

34
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,933
but Enies Lobby…

35
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,333
She cries?

36
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,399
Hum, good…

37
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,732
I include/understand your feelings…

38
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,666
ONE GOES HAS THEIR CONTINUATION!!!

39
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:26,200
IT WAS FURIOUS!

40
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,866
I will not forgive them with
this puffiness of the government!

41
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,732
Hey, lends to me a boat!

42
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,399
What takes to you suddenly?

43
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Large and solid!

44
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,866
You intend to take the sea by a similar time?

45
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,265
Do not say anything, you do not have any
idea of the power of Aqua Laguna!

46
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,799
It will be crossed!

47
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
The force of this tide is incomparable
with those which you have the practice to see.

48
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,865
The state of the sea will do nothing but worsen!

49
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,465
You cannot leave any more at sea, now!

50
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,999
It would be suicide!

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,066
But Robin gave up his own life for us…

52
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,800
One was hot…

53
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,532
Thank you…

54
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,400
Paulee-san, thank you infinitely!

55
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:48,400
One failed to be made carry by the sea…

56
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:53,866
Look at, even the large table of information which
was anchored on the ground was made carry by the waves.

57
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,066
That had never arrived before.

58
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,600
What a force!

59
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,800
And that does nothing but start…

60
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:14,333
The speed of the waves of this Aqua Laguna…

61
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,933
is abnormal!

62
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,600
Hey, is there a risk for Umi Ressha
in which Robin is?

63
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:26,200
Umi Ressha will leave the zone
storm before the large wave does not arrive.

64
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,866
Besides this one, it will be able all them
to pass if he does not face them face.

65
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Is Hey, your name, it well Nami, not?

66
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:36,600
Yes?

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
There was this letter for you in the station.

68
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,600
It is a companion with you, not?

69
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,000
A letter on behalf of which?

70
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,666
How did you make to find a so small letter?

71
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,266
Here! It was deposited here!

72
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,266
“Nami-Saaaan, Lily this…”

73
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,133
The other cretin…

74
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,133
What did it mark there above?

75
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,732
Wait a little.

76
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,733
All the beginning, it is a love letter without hope.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,599
A love letter?

78
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,532
It is this third man who would have made him advances?

79
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:14,466
Not, to judge some by the state of the things, that must be…

80
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,933
You want my photograph?

81
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,333
The true letter starts here.

82
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,650
“Post Scriptum,”

83
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,800
“I checked that Robin-chan was well has edge of
Umi Ressha of 23:00, therefore I am assembled there me too. “

84
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,933
What?

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Is Sanji-kun on train which has just left?

86
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
And Usopp too?

87
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,866
And there is also “a hooligan with funny of hairstyle”.

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,399
That perhaps only Franky.

89
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,800
Yes, it is sure.

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,799
A fourth lover.

91
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,400
And thus the fifth lover it is Franky…

92
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,066
I have sorrow for Paulee-san.

93
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,200
It would make well give up.

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,932
It is what your problem?!

95
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:01,066
Ah, there was also this with the letter.

96
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:08,865
there should be Den-Den Mushi in il' Umi Ressha.

97
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,800
I will contact you earliest possibile.

98
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,866
Please, guard this baby
Den-Den Mushi close to your body.

99
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,932
Yes, imagines that this baby Den-Den Mushi,
it is me, which dedicates you a love without…

100
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,933
I see, it will contact us with that.

101
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:28,132
It would thus have envisaged the intrigues of Nico Robin?

102
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,666
Impressing.

103
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,466
Therefore, Robin has Sanji-kun near it.

104
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,733
It is sure, we will go in Enies Lobby.

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,733
Whore…

106
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,800
I cannot even smoke here.

107
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,866
I see.

108
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:00,332
Thus had Sanji gone to the station?

109
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,200
Yes.

110
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,466
Usopp is him also in this train.

111
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,950
Such an amount of better.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,465
But before continuing Umi Ressha,
it is necessary at all costs to find Luffy and Zoro.

113
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:14,933
Yosh, it is included/understood.

114
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,666
I am sure that they flew away on this side,
then will seek them over there.

115
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,400
You also the guy!

116
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,533
With the job, the guy! Let us do our better!

117
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,666
Count on us!

118
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:42,800
Now, how I am
to make to infiltrate me in it?

119
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,600
The storm makes rage, outside.

120
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,600
COLLAR SHOT!

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,533
Be to you which, you?!

122
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:08,966
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

123
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:15,966
MUGIWARA-TEAM

124
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,800
Stop!

125
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,467
Where you believe outward journey like that?

126
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Do not move!

127
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,000
I observed his kick.

128
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,667
It is not an ordinary type!

129
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:45,933
When…

130
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,667
you say that opposite me…

131
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,332
that pleases to me.

132
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,867
It WAS NOT a COMPLIMENT!

133
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,399
It fout of our mouth…

134
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,532
He, warn Lucci-san, there is an intruder on board!

135
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:05,133
Wait!

136
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:12,667
It is not worthwhile to go to disturb the CP9 for that.

137
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,799
It does not matter the force of this intruder,
there is no reason to be afraid, since…

138
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,467
in this coach…

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,933
It is smoked out by here!

140
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,732
I am there!

141
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,333
Jerry-san!

142
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:38,600
I am originating in an island in
South Blue considered for its karate.

143
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,066
Yes, I am a champion of boxing!

144
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,667
Show us your karate.

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,333
You will regret this arrogance
when you taste with my punch.

146
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,600
Do not use such an attack here!

147
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,467
Jerry-san, your adversary is behind you…

148
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,267
Hum? He fled.

149
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:12,200
Snotty-nosed kid! Do not think that I am handicapped
in a reduced space, because of my big size.

150
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,000
It is the first time that a guy
with the head in the bottom threatens me.

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,933
My style of boxing is more
effective in the narrow places.

152
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,667
It is YOGA STYLE!

153
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,700
YOGA ONE TWO…

154
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,067
ONE TWO…

155
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,999
You ace right tiny room your lengthening-piece!

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,067
It is what you believe…

157
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,567
SCREW…

158
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,867
DROP KICK!

159
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,933
Do you know at least the rules of boxing?!

160
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,733
Which waste of time.

161
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,633
SKEWER!

162
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,932
First of all in the last of the 7 coaches…

163
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,733
we have the personnel of the government.

164
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:11,066
Then, in the 5th coach, we have 40 powerful
soldiers of the marine. At their head is…

165
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,600
a Captain of the HQ of the Navy…

166
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,133
and former Royal Knight, T-Bone.

167
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Then the 4th Coach comes…

168
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,666
where that is which is at the same time
the cook of this forwarding…

169
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,532
and specialist in martial arts in Cipher pol. 7, Wanze.

170
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,267
And in the 3rd Coach…

171
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,067
the novel member of the CP9…

172
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,133
Nero, which is in alarm.

173
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,599
Hum, it has no risk of attack there on this convoy…

174
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,267
but if, we have enough
men ready to fight effectively.

175
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,799
Straw hat!

176
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,332
Roronoa!

177
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,400
We are allied!

178
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,999
You show!

179
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Straw hat, where you are?!

180
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:11,266
Foreman, that must be
painful D, E to move in your state.

181
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,400
Take a little rest.

182
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Imbecile, it is nothing.

183
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,466
Hurry to find the two others.

184
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,533
Of agreement!

185
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,530
Was iceberg-san informed of the situation?

186
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,533
They went to submit a report/ratio to him.

187
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,800
Where do you go, Mister?

188
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:33,867
Iceberg-san?

189
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,399
Roronoa!

190
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,799
Straw hat!

191
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,000
Answer if you hear us!

192
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,000
Luffy!

193
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,733
Zoro! Where you are?!

194
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,799
You said food well?

195
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,132
Yes, of the meat will make the deal, much meat!

196
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,933
Bring back all that here! Quickly!

197
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,533
Why one should work for it?!

198
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,799
Not, it is not for it.

199
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,199
Let us do our better for Paulee-san,
this girl has just plated it.

200
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,599
It is true!

201
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,266
She must surely be very hungry.

202
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:15,067
She is in full growth.

203
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,667
It is sure!

204
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Here also… As I suspected it, it there
more only one shop opened has now.

205
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,467
I see! Ca would say to you to go to make
a turn in the kitchen of the station?

206
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,667
It is impossible! It is
under water, in the low city.

207
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,667
And well there are not the choice, one must
to find a means of going there!

208
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,733
Yes, but…

209
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:43,733
Allons-y! You think that it us it
will forgive if one returns the empty handeds?!

210
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,867
It rains?

211
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,067
They is not good.

212
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
My sense of smell is ineffective with this time.

213
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:23,333
Hey, that made one moment that they are called,
but there is no answer. That would like it to say…

214
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Would not be stupid, do what you have to do!

215
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,200
Or are you, Luffy?

216
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Zoro, you cannot be beaten
by isn't a man leopard?

217
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:40,867
One knows finally why Robin left us!

218
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,067
Where you are, Straw hat?!

219
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,400
Please, answer!

220
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,667
Await to us Robin.

221
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:54,067
One has to come to save you with Luffy and the others!

222
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,199
Oï, what occurs?!

223
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,600
Ah, Paulee-san, look at!

224
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,333
More the sea is withdrawn and…

225
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:19,333
more extremely will be the return of the waves.

226
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:23,933
One can predict the power of one
vagueness only by observing its backward flow.

227
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,800
I fly!

228
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:31,933
And if one evaluates the fall of the level of water this year…

229
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,133
Look at, Chimney.

230
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,267
Wow, brilliant!

231
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:53,667
It is as if the sea had been just drained…

232
00:18:54,267 --> 00:19:00,533
I never saw anything of such before.

233
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,600
How it is possible that it
does level of water go down so low?

234
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:09,333
It is well the first time that I see that.

235
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,267
Which will be the power of this wave?

236
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,867
The low city will be completely absorbed.

237
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,133
Let us hope that there is nobody any more in the low city!

238
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,733
They would die on the blow…

239
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,533
Noise of the sea…

240
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,267
What is it?

241
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,467
Olalalalalalala!

242
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,932
Grandmother, looks at, looks at!

243
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,667
Y' has a trick there!

244
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
Ah yes?

245
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,467
There is something between these two houses!

246
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:53,533
Hey, look at-look at-looks at!

247
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,467
Kokoro-san!

248
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,867
Oya, you are the pirate girl.

249
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,266
Ah, the pirate big sister!

250
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey, looks by here! Y' has a trick there!

251
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,533
A trick?

252
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:11,200
About what you do speak, Chimney?

253
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:12,800
Waits!

254
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,533
Why all is drained?!

255
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,467
Wouldn't this be Straw hat?

256
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:01,932
Your Lord of the Pirates?

257
00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:02,933
What?

258
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,333
This imbecile.

259
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,200
He, you? Where you like that run?!

260
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
Does not go in the low city!

261
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,200
The low city?

262
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,067
Hey, that somebody stops this girl!

263
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,599
You want to die?!

264
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,200
Aqua Laguna arrives!

265
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,667
Return!

1
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,980
Pumpkin Pirates, with the boarding!

2
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,180
Aye!

3
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,940
It is the island with the treasure!

4
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,140
The arrived first gained!

5
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,850
Have-await!

6
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,240
Await me! I want to come too!

7
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,430
You cannot.

8
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,130
Because…

9
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,500
You are an adult.

10
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
Wait!

11
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,170
Lapanui, Isoka, Longo, Akibi, Pukau!

12
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,440
Do not leave me…

13
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,890
Not all alone!

14
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,960
A dream…

15
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,150
You worry for your friends?

16
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,790
You pronounced their names in your sleep.

17
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,510
I wonder what it occurs.

18
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,730
I spent these 50 last years to seek the Rainbow of the Fogs.

19
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,990
After having seen Lapanui and my friends upright in front of me,

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,970
I have the impression much to have aged and have wasted all these years.

21
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,640
But it was not a waste of time, if?

22
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,330
You found your former friends.

23
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,900
You are right surely…

24
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,330
Does the boat move?

25
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,080
It would not have, but…

26
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:37,240
The desire to return at home!

27
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:37,240
The inescapable cemetery of pirate!

28
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,320
Ahead!

29
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,580
Full sails, right in front!

30
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,230
Do He, Luffy, one go well straight, nan?

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,900
Ouais, completely right in front!

32
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Where does one go to the Juste?

33
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,350
Where? Apart from this fog, of course!

34
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,470
Imbecile, stops saying anything.

35
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,370
Once entered Ape' S Concert, you cannot leave his fatal water.

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,690
Ooh! This front ship was not already seen?

37
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,760
Do not make any you for that.

38
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,030
There is like that a little everywhere.

39
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,900
Not.

40
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,110
It is exactly the same ship that we saw the first time that we dropped anchor.

41
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,110
I remember to have seen this figure de proue representing a goddess.

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,940
Ca wants to say… How we returned to our starting point?!

43
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,920
It is for that which I asked whether we went well straight.

44
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,260
I supervised! One went straight!

45
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,330
One cannot know if one goes right or not with this rotten fog!

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,740
It could be…

47
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,540
Seis Fleur

48
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,540
[Seis:six in Spanish]

49
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,080
What passed to you by the head…?

50
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,940
I drew in front of, but it arrived by behind!?

51
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,160
As I thought it.

52
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,750
Space is deformed here.

53
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,290
What does that want to say?

54
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,850
I on top remember to have read something in the book.

55
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,360
The interior of the Rainbow of the Fogs is a kind of labyrinth, therefore…

56
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,290
GOMU GOMU NO

57
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,290
He, He, you are insane…

58
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,660
Warp

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,150
Too much late…

60
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,550
There is no guarantee that does it each time…

61
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,450
What a idiotic!

62
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,560
Ca is there, I included/understood.

63
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,930
There is beautiful right outward journey in front of, one always ended up returning at the same point. It is the Mysterious Fog!

64
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,630
Oh, Mysterious Fog, hein?

65
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,410
Do you include/understand really the situation the guy?

66
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,240
All that I know, it is that one cannot escape.

67
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,390
It is not serious if one cannot leave. They is cool here!

68
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Nan they is not cool!

69
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,650
One has that to join Lapanui and his friends.

70
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,310
These kids?

71
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,720
To escape from Ape' S Concert,

72
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,050
It would be better to require of them. It is their field, not?

73
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,900
But, where do they hide?

74
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,540
Let us ask…

75
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,030
This boy over there.

76
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,080
How T has it shows me…

77
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,770
Ca is not used for nothing to hide you like that.

78
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,180
A Fleur

79
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,180
[One:One in Spanish]

80
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,840
Can you guide us…

81
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,580
To your chief?

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,390
It is impossible!

83
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,990
You say that Henzo became an old man and returned?

84
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,300
It is what this joke?

85
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,270
It is not a joke!

86
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,840
All that we know, it is that it fell to water while trying to save us…

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,320
I would be always with you!

88
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,950
Go ahead! Continue! Of made you not for me!

89
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,350
Thus it continued its life… in the outside world.

90
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:00,110
Henzo said that he sought a means of leaving us from there, in the town of Ruluka.

91
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,980
And 50 years passed.

92
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,110
50 years?

93
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,560
They is conneries.

94
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,930
You do not think that this old man tries to swindle you?

95
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,160
Why it would do that?

96
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,820
I do not know.

97
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,810
But, if Henzo says the truth,

98
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,250
I wonder what resembles Ruluka now.

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,370
Dad, Mom…

100
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,150
To worry you for them nothing good will bring to you.

101
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,540
Once returned, you will see by yourself.

102
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,880
You know a way to return?

103
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,860
Of course.

104
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,680
I am the Petty thief Chief of the Pirates of Whetton. Large Ian-sama!

105
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,610
Say to us how to return in Ruluka!

106
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,870
Ok, then gives me the key.

107
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,190
If you let me leave from here, I would take the responsability to bring back for you on your premise.

108
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,170
Longo, Akibi.

109
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,880
Do not let it swindle you.

110
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,150
Ian please just leave.

111
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,810
It bluff when he says that he knows a means of going in the external world.

112
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,860
What? It bluff?

113
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,400
You are hard, Isoka-chan.

114
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,080
I cannot forget at which point you were cruel towards us.

115
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,640
Listen, band of amateurs!

116
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,960
The life on the sea is filled of dangers!

117
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,790
If you want to survive,

118
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,090
You will have to follow the orders of the Petty thief Chief of the Pirates of Whetton, Ian-sama!

119
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,090
OAU! This ship is full with pierres précieuses.

120
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,840
Well, carries them to the districts of the captain.

121
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,140
There was full with food too.

122
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,100
Well, also carries to the districts of the captain.

123
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,560

124

With the assistance!

125
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,240
Will fight it!

126
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,490
L-Longo!

127
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,950

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,320
Wait!

129
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,420
Take that!

130
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,390
Stop making heads like that!

131
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,610
Food has bad taste when I see you!

132
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,610
You forgot that you succeeded in surviving…

133
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,200
Thanks to my presence on board this ship!?

134
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,350
You should thank me, instead of me to throw black looks as you it done.

135
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,260
It is what this brothel!?

136
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,240
It has to feel food.

137
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,110
Everyone, will run outside!

138
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,830
He, wait! It is my ship! Protect my ship!

139
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,340
This ship is it more important in your eyes than our lives!?

140
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,070
We do not need a chief like you!

141
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,370
Make shit, my ship…

142
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,020
It is better for us to be to us disencumbered about it.

143
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,900
Our true voyage starts now!

144
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,540
Ouais.

145
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,740
We dropped to you because you think only of yourself and you satisfy to give us orders.

146
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,940
I had not carried out that you hate me at this point.

147
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,210
But, if I knew really a way to leave?

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,980
Still saying this dirty lie…

149
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,350
We could find.

150
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,420
You also worry for Ruluka, not?

151
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,480
If we gather all the treasures left in Ape' S Concert,

152
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,770
Then we will be able to enjoy comfortably the days which remain us to be lived.

153
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,710
There does not need to remain planted there, to play the pirates in this sinister fog.

154
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,090
Then, what do you say to turn over in the outside world?

155
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,610
Our only chief is Lapanui.

156
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,340
Nobody any more will follow himself from now on.

157
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,390
Therefore, it is not yet today that I will leave, hein?

158
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,860
It does not matter, takes your time and thinks there, Isoka-chan!

159
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,860
What is there?

160
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,080
A ship approaches!

161
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,180
Prepare you all to fight!

162
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,720
Reinforce defenses!

163
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,990
As they do know where we are?

164
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,330
It is…

165
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,810
Pukau!

166
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,460
It is a iiiiimmense naviiiire…!

167
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,510
A failed navire de guerre.

168
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,860
Ouais, but now it is used to us as hiding-place.

169
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,530
Cowards!

170
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,170
Release Pukau!

171
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,190
About what you do speak?

172
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,610
What…?

173
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,970
Return to us Pukau!

174
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,990
Mr. Mayor, it is Tyrielshin!

175
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,940
My good old man ship.

176
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,470
But, grandfather, why the ship did return?

177
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,250
Oh.

178
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,440
I said to you to call me Mr. Mayor!

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,220
It is true…

180
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,850
Look at over there.

181
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,950
My ship entered this fog and disappeared 50 years ago.

182
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,510
And now it is of return.

183
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,310
Ca means that the door towards Ape' S Concert opened.

184
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,820
Approximately, here is our only chance to obtain the treasures sealed in this fog, it is that!?

185
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,130
It is that.

186
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,280
He! How do you know that!?

187
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,900
Because your grandson said it to me.

188
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,550
Species of cretin!

189
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,610
I said to you that these treasures were supposed to remain secret!

190
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,300
Afflicted Grandfather…

191
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,650
I want to say, Mr. Mayor…

192
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,050
I know at which point it is difficult to have an idiot in his family.

193
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,610
Ouais, ouais.

194
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,280
Ouais, frankly…

195
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,290
He, I did not ask you to sympathize!

196
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,930
It does not matter the reason,

197
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,790
I cannot let to you leave now that you know the secrecy of Ape' S Concert.

198
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
You hope to reduce to us to silence?

199
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Not, for you, there is a tax of 10 million Berrys to know the secrecy.

200
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,140
Stop joking.

201
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,270
Isn't He, it a little too expensive!?

202
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,930
Could He, how it exist a tax like that?

203
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,240
Therefore, you do not hope to pay the tax?

204
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,280
Group of collection of the taxes!

205
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,270
What do you wish, Maire Whetton?

206
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,690
Oh, dad!

207
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,430
Dad?

208
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,230
Send these people to the Tower of the Rainbow and condemn them to the forced labors.

209
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,980
It is what this brothel?

210
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,360
It is the Tower of the Rainbow.

211
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,240
You will work in this tower until your death,

212
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,190
To complete infernal forced labors of the paddle until the twilight.

213
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,930
You will die in one nothing time.

214
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,850
Now, Philippe, takes them along.

215
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,940
Look at, the Rainbow of the Fogs appeared, Père!

216
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,240
It is our chance! One will be able to obtain the treasure of Ape' S Concert!

217
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,700
It very revealed…

218
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,110
It is not at all a secrecy.

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,630
Three generations of finished cretins.

220
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,440
What a idiotic!

221
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,350
But it does not matter, calls Henzo and sending to inquire it in the Rainbow of the Fogs!

222
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,570
Well. Prepare Den Den Mushi, immediately!

223
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,350
IEA!

224
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,100
He, of the calm one!

225
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,050
Keep silent yourself!

226
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,180
You took Pukau as an hostage and forced it to reveal our hiding-place, it is well that?

227
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,840
I think that you have any forgery.

228
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,370
Lapanui, I am not an hostage.

229
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,820
I brought them because they asked it to me. It is all.

230
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,770
They forced you to say that.

231
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,060
It is the truth! They are not bad people!

232
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,810
Look at, it is not irritated even if I do that.

233
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,540
It is a lie!

234
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,270
It is a pretense cause a drop in me my guard!

235
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,020
It is a misunderstanding.

236
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,340
We want right knowledge how to leave Ape' S Concert.

237
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,200
What will that bring to you?

238
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,750
You envisage to take all the treasures of the ships failed with you, it is that?

239
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,770
Believe me, Lapanui.

240
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,120
It is the last thing which they would make.

241
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,710
I do not believe the words of an adult.

242
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,050
I know that they came for the treasure!

243
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,920
Ca does not carry out us nowhere.

244
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,420
He!

245
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,470
Look at! The Special Meal of Usopp is been useful!

246
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,180
To eat!

247
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,740
Do Ah, you want the guy of it?

248
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,610
It is of agreement?

249
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,490
But the taste is not guaranteed!

250
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,550
You speak too much, moron.

251
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,510
They is delicious. You do aces really do all that?

252
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,330
Ouais, nothing is impossible for me!

253
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,240
He, Luffy, do not eat them all!

254
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,350
Ouais, not as good as those of Sanji, but they are not bad.

255
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,550
It seems that they want also to eat, not?

256
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,320
He the guy! Go down!

257
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,100
Test that. They is delicious!

258
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,310
It is ok?

259
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,450
Yahou!

260
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,660
You do not let have for food!

261
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,870
Did you lose the pride of Pumpkin Pirates!?

262
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,580
Lapanui!

263
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,010
The pride will not fill your stomach.

264
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,900
Then you come from East Blue?

265
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,530
Ouais.

266
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,660
Does Ca want to say that you arrived here while crossing Reverse Mountain, nan!?

267
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,350
What a courage!

268
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,930
Ouais, we lived many adventures!

269
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,090
Looked at duels of Giants, seen Kings of the Seas still never discovered.

270
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,950
And saved a country of an criminal organization!

271
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,510
Ouah, really!?

272
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,510
Cool!

273
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,960
We succeeded in crossing all these dangers,

274
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,200
Thanks to my speed of reflection and with my courage!

275
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,240
With respect, people call me…

276
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,950
Captain…!

277
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,980
What is there!?

278
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,420
Postillonne not as that when I eat!

279
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,890
Disgusting person!

280
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,380
Lapanui, forgives me…!

281
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,820
I was so useless…

282
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,380
After having tried to save you Rainbow of the Fogs during 50 years,

283
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,900
I tried to do it from the interior of the Fog, but now,

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,230
My lack of attention trapped us here.

285
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,410
My statute of professor among the pirates is a failure!

286
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,270
But I must make you a ashamed request!

287
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,750
If you know, please say to me.

288
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,420
Say to me how to leave this fog!

289
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,230
And let us return together…

290
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,760
At the house!

291
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,760
It is possible no to leave.

292
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,730
Even if I knew one of them, I would not say it.

293
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,980
I still believe you, none you.

294
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,840
And you known as being of the companions?

295
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,870
What?

296
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,440
It is not a problem if you do not believe us, but Ossan is your companion, not?

297
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,170
In which can you have confidence if you do not even believe your own comrade!?

298
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,400
I did not ask you for your opinion!

299
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,080
How can you believe somebody who seems that suddenly…

300
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,370
And which says that it comes 50 years in the future!?

301
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,500
Only believe it!

302
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,420
It does not matter how long ran out, can imports at which point its appearance changed,

303
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,880
Companions who were gathered under the same standard should be able to include themselves/understand!

304
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,730
Even if the color of the flag tarnished, the friendship is eternal!!

305
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,750
Oh, it is with me.

306
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,920
Ok, I will answer.

307
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,560
What?

308
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,870
Hello! Hello?

309
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,040
Why you took that with the hands to him!?

310
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,020
Oh, Professor Henzo.

311
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,390
Hein? Who are you?

312
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,820
Hein? Who are you?

313
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,900
Luffy?

314
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,240
Where are you!?

315
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,980
There are troubles here because you left to carry out a life of pashas on the boat without asking for the permission!

316
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,870
Oh, Nami?

317
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,270
Be to you speaking in Nami and the others?

318
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,080
Nami?

319
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,080
Wait…

320
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,700
If one can speak to him, that wants to say…

321
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,000
We are connected to the external world!?

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,040
Philippe! Where is Philippe!?

323
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,580
Hello, it is Philippe!

324
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,440
Professor Henzo, where are you?

325
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,680
We are in the Rainbow of the Fogs.

326
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,130
What?

327
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,920
The Rainbow…

328
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,990
… of the Fogs?

329
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,150
It is impossible for us to leave.

330
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,620
I am afflicted, but I would like that you came to help us.

331
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,310
Will somebody come to leave us from there!?

332
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,230
We can return in Ruluka, it is that!?

333
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,040
Isn't Lapanui, it is brilliant?

334
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,050
Time ago.

335
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,380
I invented a device of help for such an occasion.

336
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,890
Said to Whetton to bring it in the Fog!

337
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,060
ah, and…

338
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,770
Qu-Que do you make!?

339
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,860
This guy of which you speak, Whetton. It is the type which set fire to Ruluka, it is that?

340
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,070
Wait!

341
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,710
I did not want, but to treat with him was the only means of saving you…

342
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,470
All is clearly now.

343
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,360
You are not Henzo which we know.

344
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
A member of Pumpkin Pirates…

345
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,680
Would never become a toy of Whetton!

346
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,420
Lapanui…

347
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,950
Do not pronounce any more this name…

348
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,990
Salt treacherous.

349
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,580
Ah, hello?

350
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,290
Hello!?

351
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,260
I suspected it. They are in the Fog.

352
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,900
What does one have to make?

353
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,000
Why you requests? One will go in the Fog.

354
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,780
Wait one second.

355
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,270
I already said it to you, I will not let to you go in Ape' S Concert without my permission.

356
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,940
If you continue to act thus…

357
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,660
He.

358
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,040
Yes?

359
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,210
Where is the device of help about which he spoke presently?

360
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,920
Ah, it is there.

Thank you.

362
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,590
No the problem. It is a pleasure…

363
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,990
How can you give them that!?

364
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,210
Thank you!

365
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,390
Idiots!

366
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,700

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,280
Yes, Mister!

368
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,280
And me which wanted to make a romantic escape.

Go ahead, Nami!

370
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,850
Ouais, one will deal with Luffy and others. And of the treasure too!

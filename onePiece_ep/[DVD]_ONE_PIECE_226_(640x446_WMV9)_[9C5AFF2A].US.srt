1
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Just let to me say a thing…

2
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,860
NORO NORO BEAM!

3
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,940
Remember of that, Straw hat,

4
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,900
I am a man who obtains
always what he wants!

5
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,000
Foxy, the silver fox!

6
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,510
I will empocherai the 160
million and all your gold!

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,320
This time, I you
inform with certainty…

8
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,570
That Foxy Pirates are
the most powerful crew.

9
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:37,520
This guy would it be invincible?

10
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:37,520
The most dangerous man!

11
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,450
They fell, all the five.

12
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,860
Oyabin, that we go
to make now?

13
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,450
It is simple!

14
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,950
We will crush Straw hat and will make them pay what one underwent in Davy Back Fight!

15
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,950
Porch! Hamburger!
One passes in the plan D!

16
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,860
They seem to make
celebrates on the other boat.

17
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,950
They would be still in
train making a banquet?

18
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,010
Doctor, you can go to see whether you want.

19
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,180
I can remain alone to keep the boat.

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,450
I remain with you, and I continue my studies.

21
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,330
I do not want absolutely to go there.

22
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,570
Good blood, to make me berner like that!

23
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,940
Show yourself, Tête of Puzzle.

24
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,090
Calm you Luffy.

25
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,420
You are furious because of your cut afro.

26
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,990
In fact, this wig you
give more class, you know.

27
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,110
Yes, but why afro?

28
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,280
We saved it but it
always think of being avenged.

29
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,100
But one should not forget too
that it intends to steal our gold!

30
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,620
But it is too negligent.

31
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:02,030
If we really want it,
we can destroy this place.

32
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,020
With us five!

33
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,820
With us four…

34
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:17,850
In any case, if we do not escape
quickly from here, this Oyabin still will act as coward.

35
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,260
We can escape by here.

36
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,540
It is what this part?

37
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,520
Choppy!

38
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,370
Where is… Choppy?

39
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,280
Where did it pass?

40
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,560
If you do not show yourself
not, I will punish you!

41
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,110
Doesn't something go, Doctor?

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,100
Not… nothing…

43
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,310
Whore! It is the kind
of joke that I…

44
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,360
Wait, Sanji!

45
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,210
Luffy!

46
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,430
He, you!

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,480
Yes?

48
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,630
Where is Tête of Puzzle?

49
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,030
Haa?!

50
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,760
Porch does not know!

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,750
What? You do not know?

52
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,270
- Perpetual Stupidity…
What? You do not know?

53
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,670
- At all!

54
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,200
- It does not include/understand?

55
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,690
- It is incredible.
“If you do not know, I will have to seek.”

56
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,110
It would seem that he is not there.

57
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,390
Luffy!

58
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,810
Qu… What?

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,860
Luffy, looks at its face well!

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,860
What is that there is?

61
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,050
You are…

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
The little sister of Head of Puzzle?!

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,370
They is enough, low the masks!

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,670
YOU ES Head of Puzzle! I
to me am still made berner!

65
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,680
I really hallucinate.

66
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,930
Take that,
Hat-of-straw!

67
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,800
NORO NORO BEAM!

68
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,300
You thus do not include/understand?!

69
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,780
Nobody escapes Noronoro Beam!

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,480
This guy starts to aggravate me.

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,160
Really?

72
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,070
NORO NORO BEAM!

73
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,400
Nami!

74
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,550
He, you!

75
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,280
Imbecile, draws aside you!

76
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,780
Sanji-kun! Zoro!

77
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,700
Ho not, it had them!

78
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,130
Avoided Hat well of
straw! Species of coward!

79
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,860
Stop, bastard!

80
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,670
He knows really it
direction of the “loose” word?

81
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,410
He, Nami! Allons-y!

82
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:26,910
Yes!

83
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,600
You two, remain thirty seconds there!

84
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,210
What?

85
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,290
Wait a little!

86
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,470
Na… Nami-swan…

87
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,320
What?

88
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,820
There is something of writing!

89
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,670
Look at.

90
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,100
“No woman can enter. Entry
authorized with the men only. “

91
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,740
What does that want to say?

92
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,600
Humm, would be careful then.

93
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,430
Doesn't something go, Doctor?

94
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,340
Nothing…

95
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,980
It is terrible.

96
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,000
I am of agreement.

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,140
It is only one banal corridor.

98
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,690
It is what that!?

99
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,870
What do they have?

100
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,990
I see. It is a prison.

101
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,280
They were surely imprisoned
here to have been stupid.

102
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,930
Ca… Ca is likely to be
difficult to cross.

103
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,160
U… A girl.

104
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurrah!

105
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,130
After all this time.

106
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,530
Not, I do not have courage of it.

107
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,290
I occupy myself some, Nami.

108
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,180
Usopp.

109
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,770
They are imprisoned in this place sinks for a long time, they are not accustomed to the light.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,490
If I use this flashbang, they
will be plugged during one moment.

111
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,780
And thus us
let us precipitate, it is that?

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,380
Exactly.

113
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,300
Firm the Nami eyes!

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,430
Yosh, now Nami!

115
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,870
- Na… Nami! Nami!

116
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,690
- Yosh, I hold it!

117
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,480
Usopp!

118
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,870
- Does not leave me! …

119
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,060
- Lets I touch too!

120
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,000
Very well! Ca wants to say that I
must continue, is not this?!

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,690
- He, wait! That what you are…

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,130
- They is really soft.

123
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,260
- After all this time…

124
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,390
- So soft.

125
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Doesn't something go, Doctor?

126
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,870
Heu, nothing…

127
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,550
It was less one!

128
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,810
Which is this place?

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Yo, Nami!

130
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,000
Luffy!

131
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,560
You spent time of them.

132
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,820
What you make here?!

133
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,150
What? I eat sembei and I drink it
tea. [Sembei:Japanese rice cookie]

134
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,020
I SEE IT WELL!

135
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,020
Played well. To do all
this way, I admire you.

136
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,280
But…

137
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:10,860
Heu, but to occupy Straw hat and
to attract to you here belonged to my plans.

138
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,780
Why me!?

139
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,620
Because you are navigatrice,
and expert in strategy.

140
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,020
If I remove you both…

141
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,170
The crew of Hat
of straw will not be any more!

142
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,270
I see.

143
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,020
Very well.

144
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,210
Let us start.

145
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,060
You in redemandes, small!

146
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,110
Iya, we go finally in
to finish with Straw hat!

147
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,820
It is what?

148
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,950
I do not know that one, but
that one, it is Gorilla Panties.

149
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,010
Not “Panties”! It is
Gorilla Puncher n°13!

150
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,230
It left,
Hat-of-straw!

151
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,210
GORILLA PUNCH

152
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,990
Hide Nami.

153
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,130
GOMU GOMU NO…

154
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,540
GUN!

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,710
You did not forget, is not this
does pas Chapeau- strip of straw?

156
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,730
If your punch touches me, it…

157
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,390
Ignite.

158
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,120
You forgot!

159
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,300
Luffy!

160
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,960
Remainder attentive!

161
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,960
You are now the prey
of Roboton Kick n°18!

162
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,800
He, Nami!

163
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Water! Give me water!

164
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,230
Ok! I included/understood!

165
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,450
Hope you to beat Oyabin
by using the magic?

166
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,150
Ca arrives Luffy!

167
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,320
The storm brings the rain!

168
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,610
THUNDER STORM TEMPO

169
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,990
Imbecile! Believe you to be able to destroy
Gorilla Puncher n°13 with a flash?

170
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,410
You did not really include/understand anything.

171
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,240
Neither flashes, nor rain
will not damage this machine!

172
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,550
One noticed.

173
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,820
Didn't you still seize?

174
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,690
Your punches
do not have any effect here.

175
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,600
GORILLA PUNCH GOLDEN DELICIOUS KICK

176
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,600
Fire is extinguished by the rain!

177
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,440
Iya, which do you make?

178
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,680
GOMU GOMU NO…

179
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,330
CORE

180
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,620
Oyabin, not by there!

181
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,810
Oh my God!

182
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,010
What did it occur?

183
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,180
It is Oyabin!

184
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,050
Oyabin gained!

185
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,460
He guys!

186
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,540
I lost!

187
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,400
We did not can anything
to make because of your slowness

188
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,770
AND WHY You ACE NOT BULGE, YOU!

189
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,440
He Straw hat! Since
I lost this combat, I incline myself!

190
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,990
Be useful yourself… do what it you like!

191
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,000
No problems.

192
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,620
Then leaves them
to become again your companions.

193
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,960
What? Those which wounded
my pride of pirate?

194
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,640
You do not want?

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,750
Straw hat… you are…

196
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,380
Yosh, OK!

197
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,640
Such is the will of Hat
from straw, you are discharged!

198
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,960
Oyabin.

199
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,500
Look at them. See them.

200
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,450
Afflicted, Straw hat.

201
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,230
Would you like to work again for me?

202
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,010
Oyabin!

203
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,060
It is charismatic at least.

204
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,990
Oyabin!

205
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,240
Ca tends to irritate me.

206
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,700
Oyabin!

207
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,280
What you
make, Sanji-kun?

208
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,430
It was right for
to joke, to joke.

209
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,540
Take care of you, Straw hat!

210
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,120
You too!

211
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,540
Ho, Yeah!

212
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,120
Ho, Yeah!

213
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,450
Stop that!

214
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,480
Is Ca better, Usopp?

215
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,420
I see. Why am I here?

216
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,130
Nami, how did you dare to give up me!?

217
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,590
They is false, Usopp.

218
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,690
In fact…

219
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,880
Ha, then that occurred like that.

220
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,730
Impressing, the enemy is
gone beyond my forecasts.

221
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,540
Oyabin, which one goes
to make now?

222
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,040
We go sought new
taking part in Davy Back Fight?

223
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,810
Of course!

224
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,790
Oyabin has a new terrifying idea.

225
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,480
Listen to me all.

226
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,610
As long as we will not have beaten them,
we will have to support this scar.

227
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,480
There is thus only one
direction to be followed, theirs!

228
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,410
I will not leave myself
to escape to you, Straw hat.

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,050
Guys! I see an island!

230
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,190
This island seems uninhabited.

231
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,300
You prepare, we drop anchor!

232
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,420
Well, then. That each one leaves
to find food.

233
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,470
Yeah!

234
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,940
No rats, nor frogs, OK?!

235
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,310
You are only one weakling!

236
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,670
It is the same thing one
time in your stomach…

237
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,110
He, Sanji! We have full with
fish, of vegetables and fruits!

238
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,500
Thank you, I appreciate.

239
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,360
Health!

240
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,780
Delicious.

241
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,090
He, Luffy. Do not make the goinfre.

242
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,620
He said that he had a hunger of wolf, but
although he already ate, he is still hungry.

243
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,570
It there of forever enough!

244
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,060
With such an appetite, one
will have any more quickly nothing to eat.

245
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,160
Robin, eats quickly front
that there is nothing any more.

246
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,130
I almost finished this book.

247
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,740
But if you continuous with reading all it
time like that, you will become a zombie.

248
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,030
And this book must be made for that.

249
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,100
I found you
Hat-of-straw.

250
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,980
You all are ready?

251
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,260
All is OK, Oyabin.

252
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,710
We are ready.

253
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,850
Oyabin, they look at
all in our direction.

254
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,510
Do not make any you. They believe
all that it is a crab.

255
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,980
A false crab, of course.

256
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,260
It is them?

257
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,070
They thus give up never.

258
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,150
If they could stop…

259
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,350
Ok, let us destroy their boat.

260
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,800
How is what it is?!

261
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,890
Ca with the delicious air!

262
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,250
It does not have…

263
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,350
Yes, it did not include/understand.

264
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,660
Release us, Straw hat!

265
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,300
It test to escape!

266
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,540
Shit! Take that!

267
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,680
Now!

268
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,010
KANIGANI PUNCH

269
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,640
Thus Straw hat died.

270
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,740
He you!

271
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,120
It is not poor small
crab which will resist to me!!

272
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,100
Takes that!

273
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,260
Ah, what? You were
facts of eating by crab?

274
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,460
I am too naive.

275
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,230
It is now that you it remarks!

276
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,590
You do not occupy of them,
the barbecue awaits us.

277
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,580
All this stir gave me hunger.

278
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,500
Ah, that did not finish cooking.

279
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,340
Not, it is better like that.

280
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,120
Oyabin, I am hungry!

281
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,960
Baka! You are hungry?!

282
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:13,380
You forgot that you made
part of Foxy Pirates…

283
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,130
Afflicted to have made you
to wait, Miss!

284
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,660
Here the dish of the day.

285
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
Iya, that with the delicious air!

286
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,160
Eat, please.

287
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,780
Iya, it is excellent,
you could have knocked me down with a feather!

288
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,340
Cook, come on our
boat please.

289
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,740
Iya, when Porch-san speaks
how that, that gives me desire!

290
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,060
Please go ahead, I ask it to you.

291
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,540
Hello, here the station of communication.

292
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,670
Oyabin is KB, then
join us please.

293
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,410
Ah not they is good, it
is always alive.

294
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,230
Then, ciao.

295
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,420
Cook-san, goodbye. They was delicious.

296
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,470
Porch is impressed.

297
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,200
Take care of you Porch-chan!

298
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,880
You do not want to really go there?

299
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:12,980
Imbecile, who will deal with the meals
of Nami-san and Robin-chan afterwards?

300
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,500
Is not this step Nami-san?

301
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,450
Sanji-kun! Zoro! Let us leave to find
more food for our reserves!

302
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,090
Ouuuiiiii, Nami-swan!

303
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,910
He Chopper. You found
plantes médicinales?

304
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,280
I found much of it. This
island is filled with rare plants.

305
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,700
There is a thing which me
disturb since one moment,…

306
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,440
Which is this strange line?

307
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,810
It is true, which this is
what that can be well?

308
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,500
It would seem that one
cyclist passed by there.

309
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,940
He He, this island is
uninhabited, isn't this?

310
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,270
Impossible that it is a trace of
bicycle if nobody lives this island.

311
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,680
It is true.

312
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,600
We leave the jungle.

313
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,460
We found a zone cleared.

314
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,800
What does it have, Chopper?

315
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,020
It runs towards this rock.
What is there over there?

316
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,120
Chopper reserves this large
mushroom for him all alone!

317
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,210
Wait!

318
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,870
How is what there is, Chopper?!

319
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,040
It occurs something, allons-y!

320
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,970
How is what it is?!

321
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,850
An raccoon?

322
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,370
I am a reindeer! Look at my horns!

323
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,610
You are well, Chopper?!

324
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,770
Who it is this guy?

325
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,170
What did it occur?

326
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,550
Doesn't something go, Luffy?

327
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,340
Who are you?

328
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,060
Who you are?!

329
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,850
It is which this giant?

330
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,720
Who is this man?

331
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,220
Robin!

332
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
That it occurs
Robin-chan?

333
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,630
Robin!

334
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,120
Why do you tremble?

335
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,330
Robin.

336
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,260
Alalala?

337
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,370
Let us go, go, are not
if not frightened Miss.

338
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,170
I am not on mission.

339
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,880
The weather is splendid,
then I trott myself.

340
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,830
On mission? For what a organization?!

341
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,820
It is a navy, one of more
great powers of the government.

342
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,390
He?!

343
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,390
The admiral of the Navy, Ao Kiji.

344
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:53,840
Alalala! You became one
very beautiful woman, Nico Robin.

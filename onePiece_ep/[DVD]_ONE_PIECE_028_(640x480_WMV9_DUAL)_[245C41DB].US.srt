1
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:53,662
Throw that gas mask away!

2
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,834
You re not one of mine anymore.

3
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,234
Just die.

4
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:10,929
Like I'll let you shoot that poisonous gas!

5
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:11,263
Don't be in a hurry, Hammerboy.

6
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,765
Don't be in a hurry, Hammerboy.

7
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:26,565
Damn it!

8
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:29,965
Gin!

9
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:33,327
I've never heard such cowardly words.

10
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:35,037
!'m gonna destroy him right now.

11
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,163
!'m gonna destroy him right now.

12
00:02:36,163 --> 00:02:36,788
!'m gonna destroy him right now.

13
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,667
You! Don't mock Don Krieg!

14
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,628
He's the strongest man alive.

15
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,214
He can't be defeated.

16
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,008
You idiot! Open your eyes!

17
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:48,300
You idiot! Open your eyes!

18
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:52,600
Of course.

19
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:49,092
That guy's trying to kill you!

20
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,386
That guy's trying to kill you!

21
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:56,158
For me to talk about my feelings,

22
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:59,353
Is to betray the role I have.

23
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,153
That's why...

24
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:01,938
That's why this is an obvious consequence!

25
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,148
That's why this is an obvious consequence!

26
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:03,757
That's why this is an obvious consequence!

27
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:06,157
Gin!

28
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,528
Why? Why?!

29
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,907
You realize at the end eh?

30
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,201
But it's too late.

31
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:16,703
Die together with that cook.

32
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,498
POISONOUS GAS...

33
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,991
MH5!

34
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:34,491
I WON'T DIE!
LUFFY VS KRIEG! CONCLUSION!

35
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:39,101
Here it comes!

36
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:39,935
Dive into the sea!

37
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:40,310
Dive into the sea!

38
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,686
Dive into the sea!

39
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,396
Owner! Into the restaurant, quickly!

40
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:46,975
I'm borrowi' this.

41
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,695
Sanji, Gin! Use it!

42
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:50,404
Waiter boy!

43
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:52,805
Now for mine...

44
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:53,740
ARA?! Everybody has submerged!

45
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,201
ARA?! Everybody has submerged!

46
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:56,284
ARA?! Everybody has submerged!

47
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:07,170
What'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do!?

48
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,932
This is... Strength.

49
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:36,700
Im saved!

50
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,328
Thank god this suddenly appeared...

51
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,878
W...W... What kinda guy...

52
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:48,670
To fight using poisonous gas...

53
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,047
To fight using poisonous gas...

54
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,547
To fight using poisonous gas...

55
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,716
That guy is the Devil!

56
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,886
Yeah, that's not how humans fight.

57
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,376
Are Sanji and the Waiter boy okay?

58
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:12,569
Who knows.

59
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:15,530
Look! The gas is lifting!

60
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:26,625
Gin.

61
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:31,588
Move,

62
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:33,757
Move your hand!

63
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,301
GIN!

64
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,886
You... your mask?

65
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:42,975
Mask...

66
00:05:43,684 --> 00:05:44,977
Did you give it?

67
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:47,104
Gin!

68
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,649
What an idiot.

69
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:55,028
This happened because you made
such a big deal out of food.

70
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:59,574
I guess an idiot won't learn till he dies.

71
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,448
Why that son of a gun...

72
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:07,207
As commanded, he threw away his gas mask.

73
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,208
As commanded, he threw away his gas mask.

74
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,668
As commanded, he threw away his gas mask.

75
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:12,879
To go that far, as if subordinates like him exist.

76
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:24,516
Don... Krieg...

77
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:27,477
Gin.

78
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,860
Gin... You,

79
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:41,700
You chose the wrong man to follow.

80
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,999
Are you sympathizing with my little scumbag?

81
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:49,833
Scumbag!?

82
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,001
Exactly.

83
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:57,632
An idiot who refuses my order without thought
of the consequences, is no good for anything.

84
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:04,348
Isn't killing him before he makes the same
mistake again, a sign of my love?

85
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:04,389
Isn't killing him before he makes the same
mistake again, a sign of my love?

86
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:06,099
It can't be.

87
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:06,767
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

88
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:07,017
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

89
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:07,267
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

90
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:07,768
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

91
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:08,018
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

92
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:08,268
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

93
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:08,769
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

94
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,019
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

95
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,269
To think Don would kill his battle commander...

96
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,270
No way,

97
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,064
No matter how much... no way!

98
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:13,899
Gin-san is Don's right hand!

99
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:19,363
Yeah! Till now no one has worked
for Don as hard as Gin-san.

100
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,907
Even at that time,

101
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,826
When we had just escaped the Grand Line

102
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,954
and Fullbody's marines were after us.

103
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:33,585
At the time when the commander
became the decoy for the Don!

104
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:37,881
He abandoned everything and fought for Don Krieg!

105
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,717
To think he'd really kill him!

106
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,139
That's cruel...

107
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,517
Patty! There's antidote in there right?

108
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:53,021
Yes but... they're our enemy...

109
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,898
Who cares? Just get it!

110
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:58,819
Idiot! First put the mask on his face quickly,

111
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:01,363
There should some kind of antidote in there already.

112
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:02,823
Take him upstairs,

113
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:04,741
That should let him breathe easier.

114
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,803
It's the best be can do if we want to save him.

115
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:11,039
Hurry up! Patty! Carne!

116
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,083
I got it! Shutup already!

117
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,209
Me too?

118
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:17,337
It's useless.

119
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,257
At the most he's got an hour.

120
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,344
Don't die, Gin.

121
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:29,975
Don't die for that guy.

122
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,521
You have to survive, okay?

123
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,399
I'll destroy that guy.

124
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,277
No, stop...

125
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,571
You can't win against him,

126
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:44,156
Calm down!

127
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:46,867
If you go straight at him, you'll fall into his trap!

128
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:47,534
You'll die!

129
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:51,788
I won't die.

130
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:51,872
I won't die.

131
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,208
If you wanna shoot me, then take your best shot!

132
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:55,725
Hey!

133
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,297
Fool. Still trying even though you
know you're going to die.

134
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:04,593
The sea is your hell, Hammerboy.

135
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,719
In front of you lies...

136
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,054
It's here!

137
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:07,804
Bombs...

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,514
YOUR GRAVE!

139
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,141
My grave?

140
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,981
Crap! Run away, Waiter boy!

141
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:21,818
He's hit!

142
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,283
Killed eh?

143
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:30,243
Waiter boy...

144
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:36,083
He...

145
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:38,183
GOMU GOMU NO...

146
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,878
Fool! Come on then!

147
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:41,088
It's out!

148
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,881
Come on!

149
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:44,341
That's low!

150
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,637
PISTOL!

151
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,598
WHAAAT?

152
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:24,266
Don Krieg got hit!

153
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:26,066
What is that guy?

154
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,793
He punched right into the frickin' spikes!

155
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,933
This can't be...

156
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,651
I've never seen this before.

157
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,704
Don Krieg getting beaten like this.

158
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:43,792
He actually hit Don, through his 'Kenzan cape'?

159
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,611
Can you believe it?

160
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:57,706
So this my grave?

161
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:02,919
Your grave?

162
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,844
My grave?

163
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,317
Like hell.

164
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:30,072
Don't decide my grave...

165
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,786
I'm not meant to die here.

166
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:01,228
He's too reckless.

167
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,360
Sometimes you see idiots like him.

168
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:14,265
People that fight till the death once
they've chosen their target.

169
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:18,161
...that fight till the death?

170
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,579
To have that sort of person as your enemy is bad.

171
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,839
This fight will end.

172
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,498
Whether he wins or loses.

173
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:34,261
I like those kind of guys.

174
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,302
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

175
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:49,267
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

176
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,382
Hey crewman!

177
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:13,618
Get a hold of yourself!

178
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:16,294
Breath some fresh air, Breathe lots of it!

179
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,221
'you alright?

180
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,907
Want to drink some water? Hey!

181
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:25,896
This is bad!

182
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,690
Want some of my special pudding?

183
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:32,372
Idiot! What are yout thinking, feeding
poison to a poisoned person!

184
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:35,686
My food is poison? You've no right to say that!

185
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:41,286
What was that? My food is called the best in the world! It's to DIE for!

186
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,819
Hey! You can't die! what will we do?!

187
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,916
Hey! Hold on! Don't die, crewman!

188
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:51,864
Is he dead? Is he really dead? Is he really dead?
Is he dead? Really! Is he really dead?

189
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:52,664
SHUT UP!!

190
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:58,220
He's alive!

191
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,890
Don...

192
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:03,558
Krieg...

193
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,102
Don Krieg?

194
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,359
What... What's going to happen with this fight?

195
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,252
Idiot! It was just luck!

196
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,422
There's no way Don will lose to such a guy!

197
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:18,548
Don't worry!

198
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,051
Waiter boy...

199
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:30,752
You say you're not meant to die here?

200
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,259
If this isn't your grave,

201
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:43,098
Then whose can it be?

202
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:45,309
Yours, right?

203
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,187
NO, IT'S YOURS!!

204
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,238
He got beaten again!

205
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,866
What the hell is happening here?

206
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:07,289
Normally the enemy dies without
touching Don Krieg,

207
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,000
The Don's supposed to be invincible!

208
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,126
That guy...

209
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:15,589
WHAT IS THAT GUY?

210
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:32,064
He's pretty good.

211
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,399
Yeah....truly

212
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,443
That guys awesome!

213
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:38,043
Just defeat Krieg already!

214
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:39,780
It's possible! If it's that guy!

215
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:43,617
That kid, he's a match for Don.

216
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,327
This isn't a dream is it? To that guy... Don will...

217
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:46,495
This isn't a dream is it? To that guy... Don will...

218
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,597
Don is supposed to be invincible!

219
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,667
At this rate... The legend of Don Krieg will...

220
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,211
Don't be ridiculous!

221
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:03,971
What the?

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,649
It's finally out!

223
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:09,601
Don Krieg's ultimate weapon,

224
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,361
The Great Battle Spear!

225
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:13,663
What's that?

226
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:15,140
It explodes...

227
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:16,358
Now then...

228
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,835
How long are you going to run for?

229
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,364
Let's see. Hammerboy.

230
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:27,536
This spear is totally different
from those tiny ones earlier.

231
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:30,872
After 2 or 3 hits with this, you won't survive.

232
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,084
If it hits you, you're finished!

233
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:38,588
What kind of weapon is that?

234
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,511
What is that thing?

235
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,847
It explodes every time it hits!

236
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,634
Huh? What the? My legs...

237
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,013
The fight's lasted too long.

238
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:56,623
He's lost too much blood.

239
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:58,834
He's not gonna make it.

240
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:00,861
Nothing you do will work.

241
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:04,965
It's about time for your strength to reach its limit.

242
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:09,819
Shit. Since the floor is in so many
pieces I can't fight the way I want.

243
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,038
What a pain.

244
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,500
No matter how many times I see it,
that Great Battle Spear is amazing.

245
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,480
Yeah, the harder you hit with that,
the greater the explosion.

246
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:26,094
It's something that can be used
only by someone like Don!

247
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:34,853
That's some strength.

248
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,276
Two shields and one spear should weigh about 1
ton, but he's using that heavy weapon so easily!

249
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,047
That's the reason Don is called the greatest!

250
00:17:58,585 --> 00:17:59,544
Die!

251
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:01,672
Waiter boy!

252
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:05,801
That was close!

253
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,558
You... Weak Insect!

254
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:24,903
Waiter boy!

255
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:43,880
Waiter boy?

256
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,465
Are you alright?

257
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,552
Not yet.

258
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,096
You've pissed me off.

259
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,682
I won't let you die so easily.

260
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,669
Shit. That Krieg... He Just brings
weapons out one after the other.

261
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,255
This way theres no chance to...

262
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:11,775
Even if he was equipped with a thousand weapons.

263
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:16,696
He may not be able to defeat
the one 'spear' that kid has.

264
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:36,725
Nothing special.

265
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:52,040
You should realize who is the strongest here.

266
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:06,880
Life or death.

267
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:13,353
In a pirate's fight, the one who hesitates even for a
split second thinking about death can get crushed.

268
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:14,930
What are you talking about?

269
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:16,556
At least

270
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:29,277
At least...

271
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:34,157
that kid...

272
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,427
has no hesitation.

273
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,884
Is it that he has what it takes to survive?

274
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,481
Or does his conviction mean
he simply refuses to die.

275
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,511
His conviction?

276
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,115
You...

277
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,826
You damned...

278
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:24,875
Amazing!

279
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,168
Keep at it!

280
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:35,218
Like I said! This is your grave!

281
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,118
I'm the strongest man alive!

282
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,688
If Krieg's massive fleet is strength.

283
00:21:55,055 --> 00:21:57,591
And his thousands of spears
and poison are strength.

284
00:22:01,828 --> 00:22:06,166
Then that kids 'spear' is equal to it.

285
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:10,796
That same spear...

286
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:13,940
I know someone like that.

287
00:22:14,341 --> 00:22:18,804
Someone who would get attached to that
'spear' for his own stupid reasons.

288
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:30,816
The Great Battle Spear!

289
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,818
What did you do!?

290
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:42,703
I just punched it five times in a row.

291
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,331
Your 'method' won't work anymore!

292
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:51,420
Prepare yourself.

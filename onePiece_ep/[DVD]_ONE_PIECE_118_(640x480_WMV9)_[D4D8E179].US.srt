1
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,700
The wishes of the despairing people are
being crushed beneath the dry cloud of sand.

2
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,000
Some peoples looking for hope, some
peoples hope for a little chance...

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,500
Their resolves have gone
astray, and in the confusion,

4
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,100
The Curtain of History has
been drawn on a tragic climax.

5
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,200
Nami has been battling against the Toge
Toge abilities of Miss Doublefinger.

6
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,300
Although she seems to be at
an insurmountable disadvantage,

7
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,000
Nami has gradually begun to understand the
power of Usopp's invention, the Clima Tact.

8
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,500
Meanwhile, Crocodile
appeared at the Palace,

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,100
And has finally revealed to Vivi and Cobra
the final objective of his evil ambition.

10
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:45,700
Secret of the Royal Family!
The Ancient Weapon, Pluton.

11
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,700
What did he mean?

12
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Pluton?

13
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,200
What is he planning?

14
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Pluton.

15
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,400
It is said that with one shot, it has the power to
wipe out an entire island and all of its inhabitants.

16
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,100
A weapon bearing the name of a God, the
most fearsome ancient weapon in the world.

17
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,500
And it lies dormant
within this very country.

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
An ancient weapon...?

19
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,500
This country harbors
something so terrible?

20
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,100
Father, did you know of this?

21
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,000
The secret passed down
through the Royal Line...

22
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
That has been my true objective
since I began this venture.

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,200
With it, I will create the world's most
powerful military nation upon this very land.

24
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,800
Then everything you've done
has been for that ambition!?

25
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
When I become King of this country.

26
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,500
I'll have no problem recruiting
pirates from far and wide.

27
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,200
As I gain power, I will surpass
even the World Government.

28
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,300
A country out of a dream!

29
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,100
The World Government will
never allow you to succeed!

30
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,400
I know, that's why I need...

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,200
...the ancient Pluton.

32
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,900
I don't care how you
came to hear that name,

33
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,200
But not even I know where it is hidden.

34
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,000
I am not certain if it is in this
country or even if it exists at all!

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,300
I see. I thought that might be the case.

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,400
I've already planned
for that possibility.

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,800
The uncertainty of its existence
is undeniable, even to me.

38
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,600
Audacious fools.

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Crocodile is holding
Cobra-sama captive inside!

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,700
We must rescue Cobra-sama!

41
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,400
We need the full force of the
Royal Army! We must get inside!

42
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,500
But... with those hands sprouting
from the door, we can't break it down!

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,300
If we don't do something about
those hands, we'll never get inside!

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If everything moves according to plan,

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,800
In 20 minutes, the Rebel Army
will reach the Palace Square,

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
And a battle will ensue.

47
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,600
And then, in one half
hour, at exactly 4:30...

48
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,700
I've arranged for a giant bomb
to be fired into the square.

49
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,500
Are you insane!?

50
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,900
The bomb will generate a
blast five kilometers wide.

51
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,800
I'd imagine your lovely scenery
is going to change quite a bit.

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
If you do that...!

53
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,100
Both the Royal and Rebel
Armies will be obliterated.

54
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,100
They will fall and their war
will be over for all eternity.

55
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,400
You should be happy.

56
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,300
You've worked so hard to
see this rebellion end.

57
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Destroying the Palace is
far too crude a method.

58
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,800
It's so much more efficient to
annihilate them all in one fell swopp.

59
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
How can you do this?

60
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
WHAT HAVE THEY EVER DONE TO YOU!?

61
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,900
You...!

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
You...!!

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,300
Vivi-sama!

64
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,700
Worthless.

65
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Stop this!

66
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,200
What can you possibly
gain from doing this!?

67
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Vivi-sama!

68
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,500
Now then, Mr. Cobra. I'll
ask a different question.

69
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,300
Where is the Poneglyph inscribed?

70
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Poneglyph...

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
How do you know about that?

72
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,600
If I tell you where it is...

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No...

74
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,300
I will take you there.

75
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,300
Papa...

76
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,600
The words of a wise and
benevolent ruler, Cobra.

77
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
You're a clever man.

78
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,300
Vivi-sama.

79
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,200
I cannot stand this any longer!

80
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
Remember, Nami,

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,600
The Clima Tact draws its
power from your intelligence.

82
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,000
In your dire moments,
use your head to survive!

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,400
That's our real weapon, right?

84
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Heat Ball, Cool Ball...

85
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I can use their individual
characteristics and combine them to attack!

86
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
That's the Clima Tact's power!

87
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,400
And last of all,

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
Tornado Tenpo!

89
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,100
This is your weapon's final feature!

90
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,100
Tornado Tenpo...

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,400
No human opponent will
survive a hit from this...

92
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,700
BUT!

93
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,000
You can only use it
once, so make it count!

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
If you miss, it's over!

95
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,100
If I miss... it's over.

96
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
You mustn't look away
from your opponent.

97
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,600
You've got quite an interesting weapon.

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,200
But without having any actual
fighting ability behind it,

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,800
It's nothing more than a toy.

100
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,200
And if you're trying to kill someone,
the only things suitable are...

101
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,600
...weapons!

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's what you call them.

103
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,100
If I stand still, I'm going to die!

104
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,700
The final attack, Tornado Tenpo!

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,900
I have to-

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
G-Give that back!

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,800
I can't be killed by this little toy.

108
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,400
I bet a wool sweater would
generate more electricity than this.

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
You won't know until I'm done!

110
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,400
Give it back!

111
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,700
I have to think...

112
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,600
This one-shot Tornado Tenpo...

113
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
I just have to create an opening
so she won't be able to dodge it!

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,900
I think.

115
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,700
What can I do by combining the three kinds
of bubbles and this country's arid climate?

116
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,300
If there were only a little
more moisture in the air...

117
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Moisture...

118
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,300
That's right! There
was a rain technique!

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,700
A water show?

120
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
She's lost her mind.

121
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,700
No dammit! I have a plan!

122
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh come now.

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,700
I'm getting bored of
your little party tricks.

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,300
The party's getting exciting.

125
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,400
Let's start the real fun.

126
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,800
An urchin!

127
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,000
You'll be as full of
holes as a bee's nest!

128
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,500
That doesn't look like a bee's nest.

129
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,700
The wall's smoldering!

130
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,000
As gratitude for your
little show earlier,

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,400
I'll let you see something interesting.

132
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,100
Now's my chance!

133
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,600
The hot air should absorb all
the moisture and rise higher.

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,700
It'll collide with the descending
cold air and rapidly cool off...

135
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,200
...causing the misture to condense!

136
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,400
Then...

137
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,000
Didn't I tell you not to look away?

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,100
Whaaat, these wounds are nothing.

139
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,500
I'll... keep fighting... till I die.

140
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Even if my arm torn from my body... even if my
nose is shattered into a thousand pieces, I'll...

141
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Don't talk so much or you'll
start bleeding internally.

142
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,300
Yeah, yeah, I know...

143
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,100
So you guys made it through alive.

144
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,300
Sanji!                            Sanji!

145
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,700
You're all beat up...

146
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,300
So? How was your fight with Mr. 2?

147
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,700
You need to ask?

148
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,600
My goggles!

149
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
You got them back for me!

150
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,500
Thank you, Sanji!

151
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
You're so thoughtful-

152
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
AHH! OI, WAIT A SEC! THEY'RE BROKEN!

153
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,300
You jerk, these are the
lastest model from North Blue!

154
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,000
Do you have any idea how
much they mean to me!?

155
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,400
Oi, look over there.

156
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,100
Listen to me...

157
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,700
Those must be the reinforcements
for the Rebel Army...

158
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,800
They're still coming?

159
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,000
Looks like it.

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Vivi-chan might be the
only one who can stop them.

161
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,600
Ah, shit!

162
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,900
Vwo!

163
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,800
"Vwo"!?

164
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey, where the hell have
you been hiding, Eyelashes?

165
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,900
Let's hurry to the Palace!

166
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,300
We might still be
able to help Vivi-chan.

167
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Gotcha.

168
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,900
Oi, Usopp! Come on!

169
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,200
Right...

170
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,700
Oi, Eyelashes, let me on!

171
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Look, look! Can't you
see the condition I'm in!?

172
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,600
Eyelashes, stop! LET ME ON!

173
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,720
Godness, looks like the only thing
you're good is running away, honey.

174
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,870
That's right, the bubbles...

175
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,040
There it is!

176
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,360
It's kind of small...
but I made a cloud!

177
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,030
What are you talking about?

178
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,790
It's not enough, I
need to make it bigger!

179
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,290
Enough of this!

180
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,660
You...!

181
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,560
So? Ready to die yet?

182
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,250
I should ask you.

183
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,640
What a bluff.

184
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,730
Unforgivable.

185
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,400
What!?

186
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,990
Today's forecast calls for comfortable
himidity with a slight breeze.

187
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,140
Expect a sunny day accompanied
by high atmospheric pressure.

188
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,860
With the exception of one area...

189
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,360
...where mirages and whirlwinds
have been cause for worry.

190
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,640
Beware of tornadoes!

191
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,590
Tornado Tenpo is your
weapon's final feature,

192
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,560
But you can only use it once.

193
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,930
If you miss, it's over!

194
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,780
If I miss... it's over.

195
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,830
Tornado Warning!

196
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,820
I'll decide this, with my final attack!

197
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,980
I've always wanted to fight like this!

198
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,680
For that sweet girl's sake...

199
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,200
Nami-san...

200
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,290
Please don't die...

201
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,060
Try risking our lives along with yours!

202
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,510
WE'RE YOUR NAKAMA!

203
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,590
What?

204
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,300
So it turns out you do cry.

205
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,940
You're the one suffering the most,

206
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,910
And you want to beat the hell
out of him more than anyone.

207
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,860
It summons the clouds!

208
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,300
It causes the rain to fall!

209
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,660
It even makes the winds blow!

210
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,630
My miraculous Clima Tact...

211
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,200
...will decide this match!

212
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll use my ultimate attack! For Vivi!

213
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,510
Are you alright?

214
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,400
Your left leg is causing
you quite some pain.

215
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,750
You can't even stand
up anymore, can you?

216
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,590
This... is nothing!

217
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,080
This doesn't hurt! It doesn't even itch!

218
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,540
Do you even know mow
much she's been through!?

219
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,290
Compared to that...

220
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,450
Giving up one leg, or
two legs, or three legs...

221
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,580
...IS NOTHING!

222
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,600
Now taste this.

223
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,690
What...? What...?

224
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,870
What? What!?

225
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,510
The doves tied me up...!

226
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,250
I did it.

227
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,810
I did it you guys. Usopp, Vivi!

228
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,430
Ah-hah.

229
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,650
I finally remember your ugly mug.

230
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,540
I vaguely recall...

231
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,930
...a bounty hunter
well known in West Blue.

232
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,390
Am I right?

233
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,940
They called you a truly magnificent
and notorious assassin...

234
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,150
But you're just someone's dog.

235
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,390
What are you fighting for anyway?

236
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,000
Little dog of Crocodile.

237
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,990
Did you lick his hand so you
could get a good treat from him?

238
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,360
Bastard.

239
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,630
You fight for money.

240
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,670
Pride also has a bill.

241
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,180
Get ready to pay it.

242
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,810
So your body is as hard as steel.

243
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,240
If I can't cut steel, then
I can't cut you either.

244
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,700
As you say.

245
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,010
Striking and cutting
attacks will not affect me.

246
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,200
I see. That's a pain in the ass.

247
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,240
And since I can't cut
steel, I can't beat you.

248
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,860
Then what will you do?

249
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,110
Well!

250
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,800
I'll pity you.

251
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,830
What?

252
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,340
A predicament like this
is just what I've needed.

253
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,930
I've been itching for a chance
to get one step stronger.

254
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,030
When I beat you...

255
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,440
I'll have become a
man who can cut steel.

1
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:56,350
Ambush!

2
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:56,350
Bliking and Wapol Blik

3
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,660
Everyone, come quickly!

4
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,450
What is there, Vivi?

5
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,840
Nami-San has…

6
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,810
an high fever!

7
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,600
I have a request to formulate.

8
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,550
I realize that it is very be likely for you to take along me on your boat, but…

9
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,170
In this moment, my country runs towards a tragic destiny.

10
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,990
At all events, I want that one hurries!

11
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,190
I cannot let any more pass from times.

12
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,700
The boat must continue at maximum speed towards Arabasta!

13
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,340
Of course.

14
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,870
One, isn't this promised?

15
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,760
Therefore, now, quickly let us find an island with a doctor!

16
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,690
We must look after Nami-San as quickly as possible.

17
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,100
Then, one sinks towards Arabasta.

18
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,750
It of this boat, isn't this is the maximum speed?

19
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,290
Of course! It cannot go more quickly!

20
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,350
It must see a doctor immediately.

21
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,000
This rate/rhythm, Nami-San goes…

22
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,850
He!

23
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,940
You see a doctor?

24
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,730
How if it could see a doctor, cretin!

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,750
He!

26
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,330
The guy…

27
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,070
You believe that people can hold upright on the ocean?

28
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,010
You want to know if one can hold upright on the ocean?

29
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,830
Do Zoro, about what you speak?

30
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,940
Then, it is what that?

31
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,310
What?

32
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,080
What do you want to say?

33
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,160
'Silvering, cold fact today.

34
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040
It is very cold today.

35
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,020
Yes, cold. Very cold.

36
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,770
Really cold today.

37
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,220
You believe it, you too?

38
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,250
Made immersion!

39
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,850
Yes!

40
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,540
What is it that? A water melon?

41
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,250
Why does all tremble like that?

42
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,880
Hold the rudder good!

43
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,780
If something arrives at Nami-San, you, the idiots outside, you died!

44
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,350
This thing would be…

45
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,690
a boat?

46
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,170
Ah shit!

47
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,380
C-C' is a pirate boat!

48
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,310
Terrible!

49
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,900
There are not time for that.

50
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,510
You are surprised?

51
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,030
Here is my giant boat of underwater ambush:Bliking!

52
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,600
Vivi-Chan, supervises what occurs here!

53
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,180
Yes!

54
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,230
He! What occurs?

55
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,540
Good, you will answer me?

56
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,170
Us were attacked.

57
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,070
Here.

58
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,720
Good, it is what I thought…

59
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,000
with the first glance.

60
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,530
You, the poor wretches, you are pirates?

61
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,160
You are right a band of nazes.

62
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,210
It would be said that you are four.

63
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,450
Whatever the way of considering it,

64
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,700
it is too little to make a crew of pirates.

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
It is what its problem?

66
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,470
It puffs out a knife!

67
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,410
I have badly only by looking at it!

68
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,110
Good… I already asked it.

69
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,610
We move towards the Kingdom of Drum.

70
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,150
Would you have by chance Eternal Pose or a Log Poses on you?

71
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,360
I do not have any.

72
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,440
I never heard the name of the place about which you speak.

73
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,570
Ouais! It is true?

74
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,590
Now release.

75
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,050
One is in a hurry.

76
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,710
We do not have time to lose with you.

77
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,620
Ah, do not put your lives in danger of the kind.

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,750
If you do not have any, it is not serious.

79
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,370
However, I will take your richnesses and your boat.

80
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,210
But before I…

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,070
I have a small hollow.

82
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,090
What does it make?

83
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,960
Do not eat our boat!

84
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,820
Quiet remainder, you!

85
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,950
Wapol-Sama benefits from its meal!

86
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,750
This small unconscious! Kill it!

87
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,700
Fire!

88
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,420
One should have started by doing that.

89
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,310
Can Oh, I the shooter now?

90
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,030
Stop! One can discuss all that!

91
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,770
They engaged the battle all alone.

92
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,880
Cretins! They are in a hurry to die!

93
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,440
Shots?

94
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,490
Karu, supervises Nami-San.

95
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,430
I return immediately.

96
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,570
Please, do not enter in a so impolite way!

97
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,010
That mouth.

98
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,620
Wa… Wapol-Sama! They are…

99
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,130
You continuous to puff out?

100
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,960
This boat is not so bad.

101
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,730
He, you!

102
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,190
Cretin! You are not size vis-a-vis Wapol-Sama!

103
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,680
You will be eaten alive by the power of the fruit Baku Baku!

104
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,040
Luffy!

105
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,290
What?

106
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,440
Ah Vivi-Chan! How is Nami-San?

107
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,530
This guy it is chewing-gum.

108
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,630
Wapol-Sama?

109
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,860
He, one must hurry!

110
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,080
They released Wapol-Sama as if it were a headstock!

111
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,410
What does one have to make? Wapol-Sama is an anvil in water!

112
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,570
We must recover Wapol-Sama before it runs!

113
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,350
If we will not save it,

114
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,210
it will sink!

115
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,470
You point out that well!

116
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,430
We will return to make you pay!

117
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,960
Remember us!

118
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,270
Remember well!

119
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,380
Please!

120
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,600
Remember us well!

121
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,050
Please!

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,960
What was it to the Juste?

123
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,570
They called it Wapol or something like that.

124
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,000
Who is concerned with his name? Forget it.

125
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,050
It is right ton imagination, idiot.

126
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,760
Not what to worry.

127
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,340
This man…

128
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,300
Where I already saw it…

129
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:47,920
Several days before…

130
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,470
Colonel Smoker. Colonel Smoker.

131
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,770
We have just intercepted an interesting transmission.

132
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,530
What?

133
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,690
What a splendid Hitatsura!

134
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
Hitatsura = Effect of flame obtained by differently forging the edge and the fort of the blade.

135
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,600
One of Mono Ryouwaza…

136
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,600
Mono Ryouwaza = Less than 50 parts of extraordinary talent.

137
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,250
Kashuu.

138
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,840
Kashuu = Country of the flowers.

139
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,460
Tashigi! He, Tashigi!

140
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,790
I did not expect from it less Large Line.

141
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,980
To so early meet so beautiful Meitou…

142
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,730
Tashigi! He!

143
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,670
Summers you deaf, obsessed katana?

144
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,670
Yes!

145
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,920
What is there, Colonel Smoker?

146
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,450
Do you want coffee?

147
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,460
I do not want any!
Climb here and listen to that!!

148
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,980
It is…

149
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,280
Den Den Mushi with black cable!

150
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,940
Listen well.

151
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,760
We intercepted a conversation between two men.

152
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,890
With your permission, Sergeant Major, I will pass by again it to you.

153
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,940
Yes, made.

154
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,350
Mr. 0…

155
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,910
Princess Vivi and these pirates of Hat…

156
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,900
Straw hat…

157
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,370
Pirates of Straw hat?

158
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,520
Yes, mission accomplished…

159
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,740
… To establish communication… Will receive orders when…

160
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,540
It is all…

161
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,400
There were too many interferences to decipher some more.

162
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,180
Even with the interferences,

163
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,610
we succeeded in isolating 4 key words from the discussion between these two men:

164
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,150
“Princess Vivi”,

165
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,310
“Straw hat”,

166
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,310
“Orders”,

167
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,720
and…

168
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,020
“Mr. 0”.

169
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,210
Mr. 0?

170
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,250
Could that be a code name?

171
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:23,540
If it is the case, it could be in relation to this mysterious type which we captured in Runes the other day.

172
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,360
This man is called itself Mr. 11.

173
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,910
Yes, it is true.

174
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,220
Probably an criminal organization whose members have names with figures like code names.

175
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,990
And these members carry out “orders”…

176
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,410
Something like that?

177
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,600
Mr. 0? An criminal organization?

178
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,550
Jamis heard that.

179
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,120
Do not tell me such conneries.

180
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,910
If it is true, it was what the orders in your pocket?

181
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,120
I knew that I should have burned the orders!

182
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,860
Ca… Humm…

183
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,130
Ca?

184
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,870
There was nothing in your pocket, buffoon.

185
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,140
Princess Vivi.

186
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,320
If I remember well, it is the name of the princess of the kingdom of Arabasta.

187
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,140
Its current location is unknown.

188
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,490
But isn't the kingdom of Arabasta under the threat of a coup d'etat?

189
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:20,290
Would it be possible that this secret organization and the pirates of Straw hat are implied in this chaos?

190
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,390
I do not know.

191
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,430
But for the moment, it is the only evidence which we have on the position of Straw hat.

192
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,850
Therefore, from now…

193
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes.

194
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,600
Contact the general headquarter and find to us Eternal Pose!

195
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,680
Yes!

196
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,040
Let us go on a small journey

197
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,600
with the kingdom of sand, Arabasta.

198
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,570
I bet that it is really hungry…

199
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,540
And if she ate 100 meat rations?

200
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,100
If she eats meat, she will go better in one nothing time!

201
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,170
Make a pause.

202
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,170
Go, mouse!

203
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,270
She does not smile!

204
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,380
Not small…

205
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,070
Perhaps that if one throws water on it or a trick of the kind,

206
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,490
its fever will fall.

207
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,110
MORON!!

208
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,460
Thin, it makes already night, Vivi-Chan.

209
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,320
Yes, you are right.

210
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,610
We should drop anchor some share.

211
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,780
Without the assistance of Nami-San, we will not be able to sail of night.

212
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,150
It is sure.

213
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,960
Oh yes!

214
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,320
You want them really my autographs?

215
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,640
Known as step…

216
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,350
Whore, it makes really cold.

217
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,210
Tomorrow evening, that will be the full moon…

218
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,440
I am cold! Shit, I fell asleep.

219
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,380
You are morning, Usopp!

220
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,740
I cannot remain now sitted.

221
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,840
In a similar situation,
it is necessary to move as quickly as possible.

222
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,150
Yes.

223
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,630
It is true.

224
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,450
Nami, looks at me! Look at!

225
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,180
It is really odd…
She does not smile at all…

226
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,310
Go, Nami! Make me a smile!

227
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,930
What is there, Luffy?

228
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,900
Meat.

229
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,990
Remove that! They is alarming!

230
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,610
Thank you!

231
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,290
While passing…

232
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,960
You noticed like it makes cold these last days?

233
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,330
Ouais, it is sure.

234
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,460
The temperature has been just stabilized.

235
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,940
Ca must be because of the instability of this place.

236
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,900
This ocean, Large Line.

237
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,730
Now, it is not perhaps any more the case.

238
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,070
That wants to surely say that we are close to an island.

239
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,010
Sanji-San, looks at the horizon with attention.

240
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,460
Vivi-Chan…

241
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,970
There is a winter island close to here.
I am sure.

242
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,060
A winter island.

243
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,120
In meteorology, the islands of Large Line are classified according to 4 types:

244
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,490
estival island,

245
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,600
spring island,

246
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,680
autumnal island,

247
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,820
and winter island.

248
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,740
And each one of these types has one season which is clean for him.

249
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,530
Therefore, it goes basiquement like that:

250
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,110
while crossing Large Line, you have, at least,

251
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,020
summer of an estival island at the winter of a winter island,

252
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,090
to endure 16 different seasons.

253
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,890
Of course, there are still unknown islands whose climate is not classified yet.

254
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,750
I include/understand. And moreover, there are so much islands close from/to each other…

255
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,370
The sea which separates them cannot maintain a climate stable.

256
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,130
Exact.

257
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,280
Therefore when the climate becomes stable,
it is the sign which an island is not far.

258
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,870
It rightly…

259
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,520
I see it!

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
Here is the island!

261
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,760
An island!

262
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,210
He, an island! We arrive on an island!

263
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,460
He, Nami! They is not super?
We arrive on an island!

264
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,470
You will go better soon!

265
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,210
It is an island!

266
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,090
An island!

267
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,130
Island… Island!

268
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,470
An island!

269
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,840
An island!

270
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,380
An island!

271
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,230
Thus will see it.

272
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I…

273
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,910
It is an island!!

274
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,830
White! It is very white!

275
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,020
I bet that it is snow! A snow-covered island!

276
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,290
He, Luffy!

277
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,290
I should not say that to you but one will not run to the adventure this time.

278
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,230
We are there to find a doctor!

279
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,700
Once one will have examined Nami-San, one will leave immediately!

280
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,240
He! He, Luffy!

281
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,100
Snow they is so cool…

282
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,840
It is so white…

283
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,490
Useless, he does not listen.

284
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,870
Wait a little, the place is sure?

285
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,170
If there is snow, there could be monsters of snows or tricks like that!

286
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,320
It is not even known if the island is inhabited or not. It is our bigger problem, not?

287
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,690
Oh not! One should not go on this island!!

288
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,110
Snow… I like snow because it is so white…

289
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,370
I believe that I will prepare our arrival.

290
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,960
So much of snow… I am so happy!!

291
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,110
This place is different.

292
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,430
Look at these mountains.

293
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,940
With the fact, Luffy, you ace not cold while carrying these clothes?

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,030
The temperature is of -10°C!

295
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,660
With this temperature, the bears prepare to hibernate!

296
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,380
I am cold!

297
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,000
Be always also slow for you!

298
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,680
It is a chute d'eau created by the snow melt.

299
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,070
I think that one can place the boat some share by here.

300
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,820
Well. Somebody must go to seek a doctor.

301
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Lastly, one must initially find people.

302
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:34,930
I go there!

303
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,690
Me too!

304
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,370
Yosh! Go ahead!

305
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,850
More one step, pirates!

306
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,650
He, there are people.

307
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,070
But… they do not seem delighted by see us.

308
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,610
Pirates.

309
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,470
We are with the regret to ask you to leave this shore…

310
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,810
Immediately!

311
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,190
We are here to find a doctor!

312
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,700
We have a sick person on board!

313
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
You think that your tricks will go on us?

314
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,120
Pirate poor wretches!

315
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,850
it is our island!

316
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,500
We will not let a group pirate pose the foot here and invade us!

317
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,800
Now, go up your anchor and leave!

318
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,360
Otherwise, we will destroy your ship!

319
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,520
They really hate us.

320
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,210
And one has just met.

321
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,710
Close it!

322
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,610
They drew!

323
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,060
You will regret that!!

324
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,510
Bastard!

325
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,510
Sanji-San, stops!

326
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,660
Vivi!!

1
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,420
Who are you?

2
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,300
Hein?

3
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,060
Hum? Who are they?

4
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,770
It belongs to your crew too?

5
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,110
Sure Euh. .bien!

6
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,310
You also you lost the memory?

7
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,770
Is young people and pretty young lady which your first name?

8
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,120
It is what that?

9
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,340
It is a stag…

10
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,090
Your mouth species of human!

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,980
I am a reindeer!

12
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,300
He spoke!!!

13
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,500
Pfff! Pirates per pirate Ci… per there… what a stupid time!!!

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,830
I hate the pirates!

15
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,150
Me what I like it is the money and the oranges,

16
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,030
it is impossible that I travel with such pirates!

17
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,280
'Made too much noise dice the morning…

18
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,130
You prevent me from sleeping!

19
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,130
I must leave at all costs from here…

20
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,890
Pff! I include/understand nothing there but I have anything has to make here.

21
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:57,940
The mysterious boy with the flute

22
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:57,940
The deduction of Robin

23
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,030
Navigatrice…

24
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,700
Phew… it is better like that.

25
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,390
It is although the bargain hunter left this ship but…

26
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,920
I think that it will go down on the island.

27
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,890
You know the character of our navigatrice,

28
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,210
it will not move of the island as long as it will not have made a good decision.

29
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,140
I hope for it well…

30
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,220
Aaaaah… I have faimmmm…

31
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,030
Agyaaaaa!!!

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,820
That with the air Bonn!

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,440
Gyyaaaaa!!!

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,220
Stop! Do really not be nervous for you you…

35
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,070
Finally… one will be able to always think so that one will make after eating.

36
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,570
With the fact Miss I still do not know your name.

37
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,240
It is Nico Robin.

38
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,390
Above could all, you tell us the memories which one lost?

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,510
OK!

40
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,540
There is not question of remaining a second more over there!

41
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,400
The pirates can only steal the goods of people…

42
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,000
It is necessary quickly that I find a means of returning in Kokoyashi.

43
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,890
I am content that you would have come large-sister.

44
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,920
You are the welcome…

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,970
It is well too calm…

46
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,350
I wonder what could well occur.

47
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,030
If I go up still a little, can be that I will find something…

48
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,010
Newspapers…

49
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,820
Hein? Qu… what?

50
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,470
At… wait a little!!

51
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,860
Kyaaaaaaaa!

52
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,650
What is this you ace you! 
Your mouth! All depends on these newspapers! 
I will never give myself them!

53
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,250
Hey you I do not laugh!

54
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,810
I will never give myself it!

55
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,460
The farm! Give me that!

56
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,020
It is me which took it in first!

57
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,140
I of insane!

58
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,440
Be to you which you!?

59
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,450
I will not suffer as Ca if I knew it!!

60
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,930
That is what they all have…

61
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,170
What is what it occurs here?

62
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,060
Hey!

63
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:47,830
Hum?

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,560
What is what there is big sister?

65
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,090
Ah… I include/understand, you seek a boat…

66
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,770
Yes.

67
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,940
On this island there are only the boats which are in this port.

68
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,660
Good Ah?

69
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,630
But there is only of the old dilapidated tubs which do not seem any more to be used?!

70
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,790
Everyone seems to be worried by other thing…

71
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,640
If you think that they is false you can always make the turn of the island.

72
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,900
It is small thus I think that will go rather quickly.

73
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,530
But good… take your time.

74
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,020
I am sure that you you will be able to have fun.

75
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,270
I cannot waste my time.

76
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,770
Ah… I include/understand…

77
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,480
Afflicted…

78
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,480
Not… do not make any you.

79
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,660
Aaahh… I start to be sleepy…

80
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,910
I will return at home.

81
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,910
Ah! Hey!

82
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,850
Go, so long!

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,540
They are pirate truths!

84
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,520
Ahh the clouds are soft as usual…

85
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
An hyena and horse-winged…

86
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,790
Putainnnn! Why I remember nothing?!

87
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,380
Davy Back Fight… and the large fortress of the sailors…

88
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,400
… celestial islands and country of Arabasta sand.

89
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,150
Es you sure that we lived all these adventures?

90
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,720
Yes, exactly.

91
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,810
J. .j' do not believe in it…

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,040
The captain of this ship has a premium of 100 million berrys?!!

93
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,370
Say… you know others of them? Stories of interesting adventures?

94
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,160
I entered this crew in Arabasta.

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,250
It is damage but I do not know what occurred front.

96
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,340
Meeeeerde! What a dommageeee!!

97
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,160
Ahh… it is not the kind of thing which one manages to believe easily.

98
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,370
But the fact is that the site of these ustensiles de cuisine and spices me sied with wonder.

99
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,580
Can Robin san, you speak to us about the event which occurred yesterday?

100
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,210
Ok!

101
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,260
But then with Mister the ship's doctor come too.

102
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,730
Hiyaa guiiiiiii!

103
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,490
I already said you that it was in the other direction.

104
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,810
But euuuh the fermeee you!

105
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,400
You are hungry not? Come to eat here.

106
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,230
OOhhhhhhh!!

107
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,840
Do not say silly things! I do not want to puff out with the human ones!

108
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,600
Can you say to us of what you think too?

109
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,460
Please, Mister the exceptionally gifted ship's doctor.

110
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,580
Idiotic Uhhh…! I am at all glad to be flattered!

111
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,680
You ace very content air…

112
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,880
We were advancing in this maritime zone…

113
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,670
Are Aaahhh Nami… sure for you that it is really this road?

114
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,260
Do not worry you! The Log installation shows this direction clearly.

115
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,050
Don't Usopp, you always see anything?

116
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,130
Await very small little.

117
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,540
Eh! An island!!

118
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,810
It is surrounded by reefs coral.

119
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,880
They is dangeureux to skirt the coasts.

120
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,520
This evening we will drop anchor and one will unload tomorrow morning.

121
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,590
Heinnnn?!

122
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,050
You do not want to listen to what the navigatrice says?!

123
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,390
Sanji-kun, Luffy is private meal this evening!

124
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,870
Quooiiiii?!!

125
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,090
Hay! Nami-san!

126
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,120
I am desoléééééé!!!

127
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,560
And then all the crew left to lie down except Kenshi-san which assembled the guard and me which made research.

128
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,670
Here approximately what occurred.

129
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,320
You know the continuation.

130
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,800
I think…

131
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,220
According to what you said,

132
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,660
the hunter of pirates fell asleep too.

133
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,430
It seems to me…

134
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,930
Another coffee cup?

135
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,640
Yes readily.

136
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,960
But… I wonder well why only Robin-san did not lose the memory…

137
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,210
If Kenshi-san also slept,

138
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,500
the only difference between you and me it is.

139
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,990
… the sleep.

140
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,610
I slept but I remember very well!

141
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,910
We form well part of the crew of large Usopp!

142
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,180
Thus that wants to say that the sleep would have removed our memories…

143
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,520
I did nothing but say what I noted objectively.

144
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,120
I cannot affirm it with certainty.

145
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,260
I never heard of a similar case.

146
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,500
Maintaining it is with you!

147
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,620
Speak me about your most recent memory.

148
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,790
Me I am to go to gather plantes médicinales with Doctorine,

149
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,250
and I was supposed to return to the castle to sleep but when I awoke I was here.

150
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,480
Me I… hey! Do not be unaware of me!

151
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,610
Hum? I was made carry by a large swirl then I disappeared and I regained consciousness I were here.

152
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,460
After having finished my job, I went to lay down me but I awoke here.

153
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,130
And you do not remember anything after Ca…

154
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,500
Ah? Hum! Ah! Ah!

155
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,240
Ah yes! I heard the sound of a flute!

156
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,490
A flute… a flute… yes yes! Me also I heard!

157
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,100
With the fact…

158
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,060
A child appeared abruptly in front of my eyes…

159
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,180
Can be that… we lost them but only in fact…

160
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,580
… it is this child who stole us our memories?

161
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,870
One cannot deduce that but it is certain that this child is the key of the mystery.

162
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,410
Me known as step which one loses all our memories by sleep…

163
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,560
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!

164
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,040
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

165
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,430
Do not frighten me!!

166
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,530
Wait a little! It is only one dream after all!

167
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,430
The occult facts that does not exist!

168
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,640
Even if it is not the case, one did everything the same dream!

169
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,170
Occult fact or not, it is reality!

170
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,410
I would not like to frighten you but…

171
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,820
In the worst of the cases, it is possible that you did not remember even more who you are.

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,420
Waa I had peuuur!

173
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
One of fout…

174
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,160
… to have memories or not.

175
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,560
It is true that it is regrettable not to remember memories cools but…

176
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,370
… it is enough to live again of the adventures together!

177
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,340
Do not say stupidities!! It may be that all is forgotten!

178
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,890
S… if it is the case, all our past and all our dreams go…

179
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,000
They will not disappear!

180
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,090
My dream will never disappear!

181
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,500
And that must be similar too for you.

182
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,230
Which optimism…

183
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,780
Huhuhu… with or without memories, our captain is always the same one.

184
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,860
It is surprising…

185
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,550
Aaahhh!! My puffs out disappeared!!

186
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,590
Hihihihi!

187
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,790
Uwaaa!

188
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,510
Do not touch with puffs out others!

189
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,560
Afflicted…

190
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,930
Do I have to say that it is stupid or not…?

191
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,400
I feel really ridiculous to reflect seriously…

192
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,920
Hihihihi!

193
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,710

Ahh!!

199
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,370
What you factories?

200
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,290
One. .un new remedy to find the memory.

201
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,840
Do not obstruct me.

202

Hey!! Does not touch there without my authorization!

203
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,590
You found something?

204
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
Not… it is an ordinary island as one finds some anywhere.

205
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,540
Beurk! It is what this bitter trick?!

206
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,020
Yosh! It is ready!

207
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,540
Huhuhu…

208
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,620
The great invention of Usopp Master!

209
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,140
It is what these tricks??

210
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,550
Héhé… good question…

211
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,420
These tricks are…!!

212
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,470
One can be reassured even if one loses the memory with that!

213
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,170
I named them:MY NAME PUNT!!

214
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,620
Huhu. good idea.

215
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,610
It is not genti L! I am not a question mark me!

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,230
And me I am neither a tanuki where necessary nor a provision!

[Tanuki:left raccoon]

218
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,480
One to coil idiotic?!!

219
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,760
Then, that did you say some?

220
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,140
Superb not?

221
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,890
Ouch! ….

222
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,860
Stop manufacturing conneries!

223
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,520
My memories…

224
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,180
“Are the men so fragile is not this step Zoro?”

225
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,440
Zoro…

226
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,750
You ace of the Zoro chance to be a boy.

227
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,620
Me also I want to be the best fencer of the world!

228
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,900
The girls… when it grow… they become weaker than the boys.

229
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:02,950
It is not right!

230
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,280
Me also… me also I would have liked to be a boy!

231
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,640
You will say that to me when I overcome you?

232
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,880
How if in fact the capacities count!!

233
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Zoro!

234
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,180
I feel idiotic to involve myself of all my forces!

235
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,880
Then repeat that never again! promise it to me!

236
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,990
One day or the other, one of us will become the best swashbuckler of the world!

237
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,350
It is a race between you and me for becoming it!

238
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,070
Idiot… be too weak for you.

239
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,380
Promised!!

240
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,710
Master… give me this saber.

241
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,200
The saber of Kuina?

242
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,310
I will be strong too for it.

243
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,700
So that my name is known even in the skies!

244
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,200
I will be the best swashbuckler of the world!!

245
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,240
I promised to him….I… I…! hikk hikk… sniff.

246
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,460
Of agreement! Take it.

247
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,390
I entrust the heart and the dream of Kuina to you.

248
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,840
After these events I endured hard drives…

249
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,310
… and I took the sea to seek this man.

250
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,970
To become a large swashbuckler.

251
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,670
I remember assembled being aboard the ship and to have slept…

252
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,020
After that… I do not remember anything any more…

253
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,300
Moreover these two sabers are odd…

254
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,190
When I had them?

255
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,670
In more they suit me to perfection.

256
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,650
What does it occur?

257
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,530
Who is there?

258
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,620
The last date of the log book corresponds the day before the newspaper.

259
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,630
It is coherent.

260
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,040
I cannot believe in it… it thus said true?

261
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,700
If it is the case ..... 0,5350, \ alpha&H00&)}I belong to the pirates?

262
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,870
Me?

263
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,620
Not… it is not possible!

264
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,080
And this tattooing…

265
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,900
But finally that does it occur? I do not include/understand anything any more.

266
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,970
More nothing…

267
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,010
Hyahhahhahha!

268
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,200
How are you poor human?

269
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,430
From now this island is under our control!

270
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,290
It is one day memorable and you will have to buy your life to me!

271
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,080
That which cannot pay will be killed!!

272
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,300
I do not want… why we must leave this village?

273
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,140
I want to remain here…

274
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,310
But as we are poor, one can be the children of Belmer-san more.

275
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,000
Wait!!

276
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,930
Huh?

277
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,300
These 100.000 berrys are for my daughters.

278
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,300
I do not have what to pay my share.

279
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,850
Belmer! You. !!

280
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,980
Excuse to me Gen-san, I… I cannot say that I do not have a family…

281
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,980
[Gen-san:diminutive of Genzo-san]

282
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,640
Even if I must die for them…

283
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,120
It is true that we do not have any family ties but…

284
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,890
It is my family!

285
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,510
Even if they are only words, I want to be their mother.

286
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,440
They are my daughters not?

287
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,950
Belmer-saaaaaan!!

288
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,910
Forgive me… I did not can anything make as a mother for you.

289
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,940
It is not true!

290
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,170
I do not want anything else thus do not die!

291
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,290
Nami… you must carry out your dream! Remain in life…

292
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,480
Die because of this ridiculous love.

293
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,110
Nojiko! Nami!

294
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,280
I love you!!

295
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,730
I… will belong to the crew of Arlong…

296
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,710
I will be their geometrician and I will draw charts.

297
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,790
Nami…

298
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,860
I signed a contract…

299
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,810
… to repurchase Kokoyashi.

300
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,030
To repurchase the village?

301
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,660
For 100.000.000 of berrys.

302
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,350
If I buy the village one could be free.

303
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,380
But 100.000.000 of berrys it is an immense sum!!

304
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,340
You will certainly not have them, even by working all your life!

305
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,070
I will have them…

306
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,180
… and I will do anything for that!!

307
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,240
If I ask of the assistance to somebody there will be still casualties…

308
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,690
You must suffer…

309
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,700
Yes…

310
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,170
To be with that which killed Belmer-san…

311
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,590
… it is hard.

312
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,640
If you remainders alive it will arrive to you full with good things!

313
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,110
Do not make any you… even if I will see his face, I will always smile!

314
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,410
I decided not to cry more!

315
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,690
I decided to beat me all alone!!

316
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,210
Belmer-san…

317
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,450
I am in a hurry.

318
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,680
This evening I will take all the remainder…

319
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,340
All…

320
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,000
Huhuhuhuhuhu!

321
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,120
Hum? Thin Ah.

322
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,480
I awoke you?

323
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,360
Not.

324
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,080
You can still sleep.

325
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,230
If there is a problem I will awake you.

326
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,050
Ca will go, excuse me Robin-san.

327
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,390
Do you want a coffee cup to remain waked up?

328
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,780
Yes please.

329
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,440
On the other hand, those there sleep thoroughly…

330
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,310
… whereas they said that they were not going to sleep.

331
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,240
You do not sleep yet?

332
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,250
It is you who stole their memories?

333
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,110
Fufufufu… you are right.

334
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,050
But it is too late.

335
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,200
You awake! Quickly!!

336
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,230
Ahha! You have a mysterious technique.

337
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,650
Ah??

338
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,120
Hein?

339
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,140
Hi!! It came!

340
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,020
Waaaaahhh!!

341
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,750
What is there? Is the breakfast ready?

342
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,830
It is not very nice big sister…

343
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,470
… to awake everyone.

344
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,720
I do not have any more the choice… I did not want to do that but…

345
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,060
Aaaahhh!!!!!! What you insane there you?!!!!

346
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,620

1
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:32,110
Duel in the heat haze!

2
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:32,110
Ace VS Scorpion

3
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,500
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,850
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,010
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,600
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,420
Vivi knows that the leader of the rebels, Kohza, has hot blood…

8
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,680
… and that it will fight until death to save his friends.

9
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,670
Further towards Yuba where the rebellious army settled, Luffy and its companions continue their voyage in the desert.

10
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,380
What is there, Popo?

11
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,790
Smoke!

12
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,520
This would be…?!

13
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,740
This tattooing in its back…

14
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,960
No the doubt, it is him!

15
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,690
Ace with the Burning Fists…

16
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,600
It ended up coming…!

17
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,290
Portgas D. Ace!

18
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,350
I waited this day so much!

19
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,230
It is all that there is to eat?

20
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,930
Rab! I want rab!

21
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,280
Rab!

22
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,090
Stop your conneries, you are too greedy.

23
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,630
There was sufficient what to nourish you.

24
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,790
He! Luffy, species of dumb!

25
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,980
I into reveux! I into reveux! I into reveux!

26
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,800
Do not prick puffs out it others!

27
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,810
Occupy you.

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
Why does that to each meal turn to the catastrophe?

29
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,060
Do not pay attention to them.

30
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,390
Look at. Ace-san finished to eat and it is washing its fork and its plate.

31
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,680
Yes, you are right.
It is really different…

32
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,500
Return my puffs out to me!

33
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,950
Does not want!

34
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,980
… of its andouille of brother.

35
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,680
But, with his good mannerss, there is evil to believe…

36
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,860
… that there is such a large reward on its head.

37
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,940
Is its head put at price?

38
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,890
I think that somebody had of it enough that everyone puts the bargain hunters on an equal footing.

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,320
Ace with the Burning Fists, member of the pirates of White Beard.

40
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,690
When the pirates hear this name, they start to tremble.

41
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,680
So that Ace-San is as much with its cases, Barbe Black must really be somebody of méprisable.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
Black beard… A traitor who does not hesitate to kill his own companions.

43
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,060
It would be said that it will continue it until the end of the world.

44
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,300
Ace…

45
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,220
Ace with the Burning Fists.

46
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,760
With this blow, I all will shave!

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,200
But I will not kill you, oh that not.

48
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,910
I just will attack the rock on which you sat.

49
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,660
I will burst it!

50
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,810
I will withdraw a very great pride from it to capture you alive!

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,020
Well, we can raise the camp

52
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,060
Today is…

53
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,090
I say to you to return to me my puffs out!

54
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,110
Not, the-I leaves!

55
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,420
Do you go…

56
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,260
TO STOP!?

57
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,450
Allons-y!

58
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,160
Yes.

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,820
Now help with all to clean us!

60
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,430
We are ready to leave for Yuba!

61
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,390
I- Incredible!

62
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,000
It is enormous!

63
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,350
Oh not! He saw us!

64
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,570
Magne, frérot!

65
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,320
The meat speaks!

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,040
How?
Do Luffy, what you tell?

67
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,540
Meat! The meat is made the trunk!

68
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,940
Await me, the meat!

69
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,480
Luffy!

70
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,670
Wait, wait, wait, the meat!

71
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,160
Where did it pass? By there!

72
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,570
One succeeded, frérot!

73
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,270
Is they good, Chip?

74
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,780
It has been our first meal for 10 days.

75
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,770
Go ahead gently.

76
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,100
One can finally eat a little meat…

77
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,490
Hold, big brother.

78
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,670
We never had meat in the Hostile Grounds.

79
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,430
Ah? You come both from the Hostile Grounds?

80
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,420
In this deserted area.

81
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,290
Who are you?

82
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,620
Food will not be returned to you!

83
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,970
Made a gesture and you are a dead man!

84
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,110
It is not your toy which will frighten me.

85
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,110
Did big brother, you already draw with before?

86
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,790
Sure Es you that it well will function?

87
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,820
C- How do you want that I know it?

88
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,470
A- , I wait go just…

89
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,080
Stop!

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,170
What occurred?

91
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,170
Let us stop playing dangerous plays.

92
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,060
You should rather return to the house to make your nap.

93
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,580
It turned over the ball against the rock!

94
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,570
I never saw such an incredible person!

95
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,000
Who are you?

96
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,630
There would be a service to ask you!

97
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,440
We need your assistance to find a man and to capture it!

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,470
Catch it and one will pour you a reward of 1.000.000 of Berry!

99
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,950
1.000.000 of Berry?

100
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,870
I… do not have the means of paying you for the moment…

101
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,840
But when I am taller, I promise to pay you!

102
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,830
Find this man!

103
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,280
The ultimate weapon of Scorpion.

104
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,660
When I make fly, this rock will be reduced in crumbs.

105
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,710
When Ace is wedged under the debris, I will not have any more but to capture it!

106
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,530
Be held ready, Popo!

107
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,130
Did shit, how a piece of meat can escape to me?

108
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,160
For the sorrow, I will thread it.

109
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,350
What?

110
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,320
Why you have…

111
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,250
Moron of sparrow…
What you made ace?!

112
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,280
I will kill you!

113
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,990
Nooon!

114
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,480
Not! He you, the kid in bottom!

115
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,460
Insane the camp from here!

116
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,000
When that will explode, half of Arabasta will leave in smoke!

117
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,800
All Large Line will be found on the Moon!

118
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,990
He, kid?

119
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,200
What?

120
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,470
O-where is the bomb?! The bomb!

121
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,930
You want to speak about that?

122
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,000
Nooon!

123
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,270
Ossan, you make me marrer!

124
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,450
He, kid! Instead of you foutre of me, gives me a knack rather!

125
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,620
But… But…
Where… Where it passed?

126
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,560
I cannot allow myself to waste my time here!

127
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,670
Popo!

128
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,310
One must find where it went!

129
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,190
My brother and me, we followed its traces up to now since the Hostile Grounds.

130
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,400
But then? Who is this guy?

131
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,410
Scorpion.

132
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,610
An bargain hunter.

133
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,700
An bargain hunter?

134
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,970
Why would devil of the kids be with the continuation of an bargain hunter?

135
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,940
Eh well…

136
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,470
I have also an account to regulate with him.

137
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,500
The man who beat Black Barbe with Yuba…

138
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,350
It is called Scorpion.

139
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,510
If I go in Yuba, it is to meet it.

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,330
Hein? It beat Black Barbe?

141
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,220
This man?

142
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,500
Ahead!

143
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,160
Then which are you, Ossan?

144
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,610
One can say that you one lucky devil, kid.

145
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,380
You will be able to see with the work largest of the bargain hunters of the world, Scorpion-Sama!

146
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,570
Are Ossan, you an bargain hunter?

147
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,260
Would not be astonished with listening by the account by my quite as extraordinary exploits the ones as the others.

148
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,540
Dany the Double-trigger, Ruth the diabolic one and all the villains in this kind begged me to save their lives at the end of our combat!

149
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,950
Super!!!

150
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,650
Is it true?

151
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,040
It is what I provide!

152
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,720
Is Ah, it what you provide?

153
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,430
At all events, I will eliminate Ace with the Burning Fists.

154
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,460
Nobody of other will be likely to succeed!

155
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,290
Will Ossan, you try cramer Ace?

156
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Ca will be funny to see!

157
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,020
Do not make fun of me, kid!

158
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,460
I am a man who can transcend himself when the stake is important.

159
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,560
Yes, I am animated by a great ambition.

160
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,590
I must theirs show…

161
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,460
Their to show?

162
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,560
With which?

163
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,570
The Scorpion, with the attack!

164
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,660
But Ace…

165
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,550
You really think that this Scorpion beat Black Barbe?

166
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,220
I know anything of it. I cannot you say it before to have met him.

167
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,100
Ace? It is really you?

168
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,240
Ace with the Burning Fists?

169
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,980
What is there, Ace?

170
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,300
Two men… and a bird.

171
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:12,940
What?

172
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,890
They arrive.

173
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,090
I found you, Ace with the Burning Fists!

174
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,610
I am called Scorpion!

175
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,790
The invincible hero!

176
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,380
I have came by far to defy you!

177
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,820
Ca will be a true combat!

178
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,140
Then it is him, Scorpion…

179
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,050
He! Is everyone there?

180
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,730
L- Luffy?!

181
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,920
But what you insane on the back of this sparrow?

182
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,320
It is there in flesh and bone…

183
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,050
This guy, it is Ace with the Burning Fists!

184
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,050
What doesn't go, Ossan?

185
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,110
Hein? Euh, nothing…

186
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Miss chance for you!
I am a specialist in the combat!

187
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,810
Today I will put a term at your legendary bravery!

188
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,840
It is unconscious… which imbecile…

189
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,870
I am very excited!

190
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,850
Ace! A true combat!

191
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,300
Do not deflate!

192
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,050
How if I were going to deflate me!

193
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,470
Eh well, I have to me also something to ask him.

194
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,670
Break from there, Luffy!

195
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,680
What arrives to me?

196
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,960
I should not weaken!

197
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,630
I am invulnerable.
I cannot die…

198
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,440
… since they await me!

199
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,650
I arrive, Ace with the Burning Fists!

200
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,390
Take that!

201
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,690
AH! Q-Q-Q-Q-what?!

202
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,270
It turned over the steel net against him!

203
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,060
If Ace with the Burning Fists had been beaten also easily, the combat would not have been interesting.

204
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,980
It would be said that you decided to continue.

205
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,440
The Combat of the Hell can now start!

206
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,050
Popo! My Prescorraci rifle!

207
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,900
Rifle pressurized with the corrosive acid!

208
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,690
Q- WHAT?

209
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,900
Corrosive acid?

210
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,320
With that, I will sprinkle you of pressurized acid!

211
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,020
Afflicted, but that really does not resemble a combat.

212
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,120
One had to expect it, but…

213
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,500
… the history as what you did eliminate Black Barbe was only one lie, is not this?

214
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,330
You knew that while spreading this rumor in connection with Black Barbe, I was going to come to your meeting.

215
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,360
It is well that?

216
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,470
Just.

217
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,980
It, which do you think was not a bad plan?

218
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,760
We were of equal force until now.

219
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,960
It is time for me to pass to the serious things!

220
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,680
Ca is enough!

221
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,380
Dad, that is enough!

222
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,030
“Dad”?

223
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,850
“Pa Dad”?

224
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,350
Stop!

225
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,840
D-Dip! Chip!

226
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,270
Dad!

227
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,430
You are not enough strong to beat it.
It is Ace with the Burning Fists!

228
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,920
What you made there?

229
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,660
When are you parties of the Hostile Grounds?

230
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,490
Dad, looks at!

231
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,190
A large potato was really found!

232
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,530
He, you are right.

233
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,550
There still was only one potato to eat this evening.

234
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,790
I would like at least once, to eat until being able moreover it.

235
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,330
Imbecile! Do not say things like that in front of dad!

236
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,720
Dad gave up his row of bargain hunter to deal with us whereas it was very important for him.

237
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,520
Yes…

238
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,580
Beyond the sea, there are exceptional men who live extraordinary adventures…

239
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,500
There is not only one can make to go up the moral one to him?

240
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,680
Of course that not!

241
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,530
Even without anything interesting to make, we will remain in life!

242
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,680
Dad gave up his dream for us.

243
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,600
For us, the most important thing, it is to remain in life.

244
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,480
It is what these sad faces?!

245
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,530
Stop to you apitoyer on your fate of the kind!

246
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,500
Dad!

247
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,040
Listen to me well!

248
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,170
I will become again an bargain hunter!

249
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,130
I will defy celebrates it Ace with the Burning Fists!

250
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,440
And after having disputed largest of the engagements in the world… I will return here as a winner!

251
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,060
It is too hard, this larger combat in the world!

252
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,690
One came for you, Papa!

253
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,910
What do you tell?

254
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,850
Your father is currently the largest bargain hunter in the world.

255
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,810
Dany the Double-trigger, Ruth the diabolic one and all the other villains in this kind begged me to save their lives…

256
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,870
It is what you envisage to do.

257
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,290
Then you knew…

258
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,050
Eh yes, your old father is only one boasting who is not worth large thing.

259
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,370
But, there was a share of truth.

260
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,270
It does not matter that you can be weak or even unimportant,

261
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,210
if you have will, then you will be able to even defy the most powerful men of the world!

262
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,540
I wanted to show you…

263
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,590
I wanted to show you a great dream!

264
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,410
A man must have a dream which animates it.

265
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,870
One should not be let cut down!

266
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,910
It is necessary to fight!

267
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,880
It is necessary to continue to laugh and live!

268
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,200
Since you defy the impossible one, you will live in a paradise.

269
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,420
It is what I must show you,
even if I must risk my life.

270
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,930
Yes, if you do not lower the arms, then all will be possible!

271
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,180
Pa Dad!

272
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,070
You thus could see the invincible spirit of your father!

273
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,860
How? I will not lose!

274
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,080
As a long time as I will be animated by this great dream!

275
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,910
Popo! My Bazooka!

276
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,480
Ace with the Burning Fists!
It is the end!

277
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,820
Dad! Stop!
Please!

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,170
Dip! Chip!

279
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,680
I included/understood what you wanted to say to us!

280
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,640
But we also envisaged to beat us!

281
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,020
Of living each day as it arrives!

282
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,170
Since you will be there, we will have courage!

283
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I am sorry to be to me apitoyé!

284
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,540
I make fun about it, of food!

285
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,210
I am happy since you are with us!

286
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,270
I love you, Dad!

287
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,670
I love you too!

288
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,330
Dip! Chip!

289
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,950
Dad!

290
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,440
I undertake some!

291
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,390
Dad!

292
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,550
Dad!

293
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,200
Dad!

294
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,110
You are well?

295
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,210
Ace!

296
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,170
Dad protected us!

297
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,130
He, Ossan… Died to you?

298
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,140
E- Species of simpleton.

299
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,350
As if I could die…

300
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,560
… and to give up my expensive let us fistons.

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
Scorpion-Sama is invincible!

302
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,360
I thank you for being come to seek your old father.

303
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,700
Let us turn over on our premises, in the Hostile Grounds.

304
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,410
Well, it is here that one separates.

305
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,250
You us free really, Ace?

306
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,900
Yes.

307
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,700
Barbe Noire is not in Arabasta.

308
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,980
I do not have any reason to remain in this country.

309
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,850
I see.

310
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,280
Where do you hope to go then?

311
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,450
Scorpion told me that a guy had seen it in the West.

312
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,040
I will try to seek in this direction.

313
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,860
Luffy.

314
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,020
Always keep it with you.

315
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,100
What, it is right a bit of paper.

316
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,420
This bit of paper will enable us to meet again.

317
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,570
You do not want any?

318
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,300
If, if.

319
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,410
After all, it is normal that I worry for my little brother.

320
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,750
It may be also that it burns you unceasingly the hands.

321
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,040
Take well care for me.

322
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,400
Luffy, the next time that one will see oneself, that will be at the Top of the Pirates.

323
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,360
Of agreement!

324
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,510
Exceed yourself.

325
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,110
He!!!

326
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,470
He!!!

327
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,930
Hein? Where did Ace pass?

328
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,670
It left.

329
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,750
Ace with the Burning Fists…

330
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,360
It will be re-examined.

331
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,550
Yes, I am sure.

1
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,940
The plan of Eneru God
come to a end.

2
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,860
Will run as far as you will want it…

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,679
populate sky!

4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,539
It is the ultimate song of Skypiea!

5
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,469
Festivities of
dancing angels of the sky!

6
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,940
You over there, you already saw the expression of one
mortal who loses balance suddenly?

7
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,419
You all, please!

8
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,109
You must join Cloud
End on bank of the cloud…

9
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,159
and to flee towards
Blue sea immediately!

10
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,210
Eneru God with the intention
to destroy this country!

11
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,360
While remaining here, NONE
will not survive us!

12
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,760
You must be solved
to leave this country!

13
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,919
Whereas inhabitants
start to flee,

14
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,410
Luffy and Eneru start
finally the combat!

15
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,109
It IS YOU…

16
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,760
THAT ONE CALLS ENERU?!

17
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,540
IN WHAT ES YOU GOD?!

18
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,510
You go soon the knowledge.

19
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,060
EL THOR

20
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,550
100.000.000 VOLT VARI

21
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,719
It is that!

22
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,849
The lightning does not have any effect on him!

23
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,680
It is out of rubber!

24
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,660
Luffy is perhaps only on
ground with being able to beat Eneru…

25
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,370
Its natural enemy!

26
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:58,920
Maxim flies away!
The Beginning of Deathpiea!!

27
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,619
Rubber…

28
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,800
electricity does not lead.

29
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,060
The attacks of Eneru will not have
no effect on a man-rubber band!

30
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,910
It should be able to beat Eneru!

31
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,780
What are you thus?

32
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,090
Dumb!

33
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,290
I am Luffy.

34
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,090
Pirate and man-rubber band.

35
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,550
Rubber band?

36
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,309
I see!

37
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,760
There is no rubber
on the Sea of Opal.

38
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,439
The lightning…

39
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
WILL NOT FUNCTION!!

40
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,260
Mantra

41
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,340
Gomu Gomu No Muchi

42
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,340
[Note:Muchi = Whip]

43
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,260
[Note:Yari = Lance]

44
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,970
It anticipates all them
movements of Luffy!

45
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,280
Luffy!

46
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,540
Do not over-estimate yourself.

47
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,820
I can reduce to you in crumbs
without using the lightning.

48
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,340
When I know that some
thing does not function,

49
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,050
I adapt my style of combat.

50
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,240
To touch me will not go either!

51
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,240
Shit!

52
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,810
It can anticipate my movements
with this odd capacity!

53
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,529
The lightning does not go.

54
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,699
The physical blows do not go.

55
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,280
What rubber?

56
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,249
Not, a minute.

57
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,480
It is a Paramécia type.

58
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,310
I already saw the extent of his capacities.

59
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,739
GLOAM

60
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,420
[Note:luminous metallurgy]

61
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,470
I do not have time to play
with people of your species!

62
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,539
Its stick…

63
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,150
It transforms it into sharp weapon?

64
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,770
Regard that as one
form solid the lightning!

65
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,949
As I thought it, you are
sensitive to the piercing attacks!

66
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,360
Ouais.

67
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,470
DO NOT SAY TO HIM!

68
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,279
Gomu Gomu No Gatling…

69
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,979
What?

70
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,410
It disappeared?!

71
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,880
Luffy! Behind you!

72
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,970
It passes through gold?!

73
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,230
It is HOT!!

74
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,269
Electricity alone does not have an effect,

75
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,620
but if I make it circulate in my
launch to heat it, I can…

76
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,320
Gomu Gomu No Ono

77
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,520
[Note:Ono = Axe]

78
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,340
Salt snotty-nosed kid!

79
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,400
Gomu Gomu No Gatling Gun

80
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,560
It is not like if
you had several arms!

81
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,910
Luffy!

82
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,699
Tourism on the celestial island…

83
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,510
You came to bad
moment, inhabitants of the Blue Sea.

84
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,009
I am God.

85
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,710
I can do everything to fold with my will.

86
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,750
I will create soon my ideal world!

87
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,800
A boy who arrives like that of the Blue Sea
without having the least idea of this world…

88
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,360
will be never able to stop me.

89
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,940
Then? Want you to join me…

90
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,740
and to attend the eradication of this country?

91
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,069
Impossible…

92
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,980
MAX 200.000.000 VOLT VARI

93
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,749
Bird-horse-chan
!

94
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,399
The Arch moves!

95
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,890
What does one make?

96
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,469
Luffy!

97
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,840
Nami!

98
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,149
See!

99
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,469
It flies away!

100
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,910
Here the Arch which will carry out me to
infinite ground, Fairy Vearth!

101
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,530
Maxim!

102
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,960
It rises!

103
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,290
Oh not! Oh not! Oh
not! Oh not! Oh not!

104
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,630
We must go down from this thing!

105
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,159
L-Luffy!

106
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,219
Hurry to finish Eneru!

107
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,649
Ah, have-have-have-await
one second!

108
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,419
If it beats Eneru… the Arch will fall?

109
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,319
Ah, but if it does not beat it,
the celestial island is foutue.

110
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,570
And then, if we remain here…

111
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,900
Who knows where we go?

112
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,009
What makes one, Luffy?!

113
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,930
We are…

114
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,440
Stop taking the head to you.

115
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,230
But… It is…

116
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,860
Be to you a partner of
future King of the Pirates.

117
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,230
Do not make this pathetic head.

118
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,480
The King of the Pirates?

119
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,230
And which country it
does king control?

120
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,640
He is the king of more
large sea of the world!

121
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,039
A creditable title.

122
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,270
Now, I believe that the sky
the conclusion of our combat waits!

123
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,810
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

124
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,320
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

125
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,159
Look at,
Bird-horse-chan!

126
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,420
The Arch stopped!

127
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,550
It was wedged in Vearth
and cannot go up higher!

128
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,409
But it is right a question of time!

129
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,980
It continues to return inside!

130
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,499
Not question! One cannot!

131
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,529
If one goes there, one would be just awkward!

132
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,760
Luffy is a warrior of the Blue Sea!

133
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,640
One never should intervene
in a duel of warriors!

134
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,579
The celestial island will fall from the sky!

135
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,709
It is the end!

136
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,759
You put at the shelter!

137
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,799
Please evacuate more
quickly possible!

138
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,230
We, the White Berets, we go
you to help to reach Cloud End…

139
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,369
Step pity,
you dispatch!

140
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,210
Quickly! We do not have any more time!

141
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,609
We must…

142
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,040
We must save all
the lives which we will be able!

143
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,120
Gurudin!

144
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,359
What do you make?

145
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
Hurry to flee!

146
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,389
I believed in a God so a long time.

147
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,890
If God considered to be necessary to take
our lives, then we must accept it.

148
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,119
Eneru…

149
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,130
This man does not have any right
to have our lives!

150
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,890
We all must survive…

151
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,520
and to continue to live!

152
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,119
Please, flee!

153
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,010
And by pity, screw!

154
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,430
Grandfather.

155
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,730
Grandfather, quickly!

156
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,759
Heso!

157
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,290
Captain!

158
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,160
We go to the Shandia village!

159
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,669
The Shandia village?

160
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,930
If nobody goes them
to inform, they will die!

161
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,459
We all go us
to escape together!

162
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,740
Shandia are
human, just like us!

163
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,690
Go ahead!

164
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,630
Circuits for the ultimate function of the Arch
were engaged, and they turn to full mode.

165
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,529
Its ultimate function?

166
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,299
Its name is Deathpiea.

167
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,460
It is the name of the despair which
will be the saver of this world!

168
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,070
What does it prepare?

169
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,579
Now, Deathpiea…

170
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,440
Start!

171
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,270
It is what that?!

172
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,690
A cloud?

173
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,900
Clouds?

174
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,770
Chief!

175
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,749
It occurs something in
sky above Upper Yard!

176
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,049
In the sky?

177
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,300
Ouais, it is suddenly
put to make black.

178
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,260
It is the first time that one
such thing arrives on Skypiea.

179
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,269
I have a bad presentiment.

180
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,359
It would have arrived some
thing with the warriors?

181
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,829
Yes.

182
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:12,290
So that such a thick cloud is in
sky above the Sea of Opal…

183
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,559
Everyone, quickly!

184
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,689
What is it?

185
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,669
Sky! The sky becomes black!

186
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,870
Quickly, will run!

187
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,040
What?!

188
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,370
Wait!

189
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,060
Are they…?

190
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,899
It is that.

191
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,619
They are clouds of flashes.

192
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,800
By using my energy, Deathpiea combines
extremely intense drafts…

193
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,329
and produced clouds of flashes!

194
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,790
Clouds of flashes?

195
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,360
Soon, when clouds
will be in charge of energy,

196
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,310
they will wrap all
Skypiea in darkness.

197
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,670
And I could then create
incommensurable striking down flashes…

198
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,700
and to destroy any trace of this country!

199
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,400
And to show you…

200
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,590
Ca came from Upper Yard!

201
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,510
With the boats, quickly!

202
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,889
That everyone remains
calm, do not panic!

203
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,350
Sink in Cloud End!

204
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,970
Would be cursed, Eneru!

205
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,270
Eneru…

206
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,760
What did you make?

207
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,930
I teased a little the angels.

208
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,239
Then to be God…

209
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,519
allows you to take what you want?!

210
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,639
Exact.

211
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,459
The life and the ground belong to me.

212
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,320
Now, I go
also to take your life!

213
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,330
The festivities just started!

214
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,590
Dumb!

215
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,329
C-C-CHAUD
!!

216
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,140
Heat, heat, heat, heat, heat!

217
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,520
I used my electricity
to heat this lance!

218
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,410
HEAT!!

219
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,119
Shit!

220
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,420
I can nothing make for this trick
of prediction of movements?

221
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,350
I found!

222
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,150
Gomu Gomu No…

223
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,390
[Note:confused]

224
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,950
What you insane, Luffy?!

225
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,800
It uses its reflexes for
to avoid the attacks unconsciously!

226
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,920
Not, it acts like a grass bit, oscillating
in the wind instead of being opposed to him!

227
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
He does not think! It is for that Eneru
cannot anticipate its movements!

228
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,120
When I disconnect my brain…

229
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,899
I cannot attack.

230
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,150
IMBECILE!

231
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,350
If I could catch it,
I would have an advantage.

232
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,480
It is that!

233
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,740
[Note:Tako = Octopus]

234
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,919
NOOOON!!!!

235
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,449
Stop with your stupid ideas!

236
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,900
I see that you do not like my Mantra.

237
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,599
That goes without saying.

238
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,190
It is the base of my
incredible capacity!

239
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,590
This position will go!

240
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,309
Gomu Gomu No…

241
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,159
No matter what you tents…

242
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,710
besides your immunity with the lightning,
you remainders an impotent mortal!

243
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,210
Tako…

244
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,139
Why the Arch…?!

245
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,070
[Note:fires of artifices]

246
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:27,829
Poor insane!

247
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,509
You do not even try to touch me!

248
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,639
Or then you test
to destroy the boat?

249
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,660
You will not arrive there!

250
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,919
Of course!

251
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,329
The rebound!

252
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,600
The punches which rebound on the walls are not directed by the will of Luffy!

253
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,460
I will not leave you
to leave again!

254
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,340
GOMU GOMU NO…

255
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,099
Have-await!

256
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,110
BAZOOKA!

257
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,180
Oh not! It charges!

258
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,119
To flee…

259
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,469
I must flee!

260
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,810
GOMU GOMU NO…

261
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,830
It arrives!

262
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,260
To flee!

263
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,840
FILE

264
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,840

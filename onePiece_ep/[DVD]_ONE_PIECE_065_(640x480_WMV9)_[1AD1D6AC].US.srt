Vagueness of the Falcon

4

Technique of the fist

5

Surpuissant

6
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,050
9 with hot blood

7
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,490
Beats without fear

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,120
Dance with the tempting perfume

9
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,160
Drive with the Home-Run beats

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:39,400
Explosive Santoryu!

11
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:39,400
Zoro VS Baroque Works!

12
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,720
Welcome on Large Line!

13
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
Welcome in our city!

14
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,880
The city of the celebration… Whiskey Peak!

15
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,830
It is really delicious.

16
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,910
Which chochotte.

17
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,820
I do not feel well.

18
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,500
There is about a hundred hunters of premium here.

19
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,130
I will deal with you,

20
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,840
Works baroque.

21
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,620
Was Oh, it supposed being a secrecy?

22
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,880
Since you know our small secrecy, we thus will have to eliminate you.

23
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,960
This night still…

24
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,390
We will add a new tomb stone on the Rock-Cacti.

25
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,300
Kill it!!!

26
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,410
It… disappeared!

27
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,610
It left!

28
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,370
Where it slipped by?

29
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,380
Well…

30
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:09,960
One goes there?

31
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,590
Dumb, you insane of us!

32
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,100
Fire!!

33
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,040
Imbeciles!
They were entretués.

34
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,630
It still disappeared.

35
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,290
You move!

36
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,680
It is only one poor swashbuckler!

37
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,480
A small question…

38
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,830
A new tomb stone, that will be enough you believe?

39
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,470
Here it is!
Here!

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,880
Bandage idiots!
You want also to draw me above?

41
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,040
Stop!

42
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,760
Where it still left this type?

43
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,210
It was a light machine gun its trick?

44
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,230
It failed well to have me…

45
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,560
One would say well

46
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,060
that we will owe us
in occupying ourselves.

47
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,560
He believes himself able to beat us
with him all alone?

48
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,720
He however said to know Baroque Works.

49
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,250
He, nice, thus approaches a little.

50
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,010
Song with the glory of Usopp N°721…
It left!

51
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,350
Then this so accessible city, Whiskey Peak, are a true den of hunters of premium…

52
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,310
I was sure!

53
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,240
Where is it?

54
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,050
Find it quickly!

55
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,090
My new toys which I had in Logue Town:
Yubashiri, Sandai Kitetsu…

56
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,780
Here is the occasion to test you both.

57
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,670
One goes défouler a little on these types.

58
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,240
I found it!

59
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,620
Burst!!

60
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,510
Shit!

61
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,060
Let us start with… Yubashiri!

62
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,420
It is light.

63
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,740
A good katana.

64
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,870
It was found! By here!

65
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,630
Do not move!

66
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,910
Found, hein?

67
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,240
It goes up on the roofs.

68
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,770
Take that!

69
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,700
I was hot.

70
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,000
Be stopped to you!

71
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,340
Monday miss!

72
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,890
It was good wine.
Which waste…

73
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,180
What does that want to say?

74
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,160
Which terrible desire of blood,
Sandai Kitetsu!

75
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,010
Meitô is supposed to slice only when its Master orders it.

76
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,870
You have me the quite capricious air.

77
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,460
It is that to have a cursed blade?

78
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,280
Oh, God, grant to us your divine protection.

79
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,470
Have pity.

80
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,840
God, grants to us your divine protection and saves us!

81
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,000
The blow of the innocent ones,
it goes only with nice people.

82
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,780
I struck you with the dish of the sword,
be grateful.

83
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,640
It continues to go up!

84
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,660
Encircle it!!

85
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,680
It is there!
Stop it! Encircle it!

86
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,410
Me above was walked?

87
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,730
Gente rams, would you grant this dance to me?

88
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,140
It is all that they have like treasures?

89
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,730
In here is a den of hunters of premium…

90
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,090
Whiskey Peak is rather a den of mown.

91
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,350
It cannot hide any more!

92
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,550
The scale is falling!

93
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,290
It comes towards us!

94
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,900
Fire!!

95
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,170
Made blunder, I bored a hole here.

96
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,590
Outch! It failed to have me!

97
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,580
Do not play finest.

98
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,860
Nobody can compete with my force.

99
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,870
It is the end for you.

100
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,100
Which loss D… My my maaa.
Which waste of time.

101
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,010
But it is finished, one would say.
“The end”.

102
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,500
What?

103
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,430
Semi… Monday miss!

104
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,110
And Ben then, the frimeuse one?

105
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,890
You did not want to measure you with me?

106
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,880
One continues, Baroque Works?

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,940
A baston, it is not fun.

108
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,300
Semi… Did Miss Monday lose against him in a épreuve de force?

109
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,550
It is not possible…

110
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,500
I included/understood!

111
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,270
The Navy had to be mistaken on the research opinion!

112
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,870
I see.
Is very explained then.

113
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,990
If it is him which is worth 30 million Berrys,
then it is normal.

114
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,770
It is him the true Captain.

115
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,960
It is that.

116
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,300
That astonished me that this buffoon has a premium of 30 million on his head.

117
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,540
When well even, which humiliation

118
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,410
to be beaten by a swashbuckler alone.

119
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,650
The Boss entrusted this city to us,
we of it are responsible.

120
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,690
It is finally in our turn to play.

121
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,380
You know it perhaps already…

122
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,360
With Works Baroque, plus the number is low,

123
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,970
more the level of the member is high.

124
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,080
Us three:Mr. 9,

125
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,920
Mr. 8

126
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,660
and Wednesday Miss,

127
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,200
sums of the agents to a figure.

128
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,160
What wants to say that all those that you beat up to now

129
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,940
are well loins behind us.

130
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,150
Which is the interest to praise itself right in the middle of a combat?

131
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,110
It is strongest which will gain.

132
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,860
It is as simple as that.

133
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,220
With the attack, Wednesday Miss!

134
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,000
Ok, Mr. 9!

135
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,130
Come here, Karoo!

136
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,580
I said to you “come here”, not “raises your wing”!!

137
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,550
One will show him your super speed faster than that of the leopard!

138
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,860
Who said to you “slept”?

139
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,920
It is what this brothel?

140
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,100
You believe that you can let yourself distract?

141
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,920
Let us see seeing as you manage my talents of Acro-beater!

142
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,930
These beaters are out of tempered steel!

143
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,620
Attention not to break your sabers!

144
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,600
What is there?
Be paralyzed to you by the fear?

145
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,410
Then it is that, your talents of Acro-beater?

146
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,460
Since you hold to with it as much as that, here they are!

147
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,840
Eh well, I hope that it was not the best.

148
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,470
The best?
It is me!

149
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,810
Prepare, Mr. Bushido!

150
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,280
Come… Leave yourself enivrer by the soft fragrance of my perfume…

151
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,460
Nice fellow.

152
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,500
The coup de grâce…

153
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,000
Ahead, Karoo!

154
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,940
You exceeded it!!!

155
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,810
This combat starts to become embarrassing.

156
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,390
It slipped by this hole.

157
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,830
It is useless.

158
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,260
You will taste with the true terror!

159
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,470
This machine-gun is a true wound.

160
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,150
I do not see how I will approach him.

161
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,940
How did you dare to do that to me??

162
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
You will pay it to me!

163
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,780
Fell to you all alone.

164
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,110
You ace an arm in less, now!

165
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,460
A steel chain…

166
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,330
You had it.

167
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,920
Go ahead.
Kill it, Mr. 8!

168
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,490
You cannot escape any more.

169
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,230
Well, does not move any more.

170
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,220
With the least suspect gesture, your invaluable friend leaves the life there.

171
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,800
Perfect, Wednesday Miss!

172
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,830
Now it is impossible for him to flee

173
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,330
or to counter-attack!

174
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,330
This moron could at least awake when it is taken as an hostage.

175
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,200
Armament of the guns!

176
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,780
Guns avoided to draw!

177
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,670
What?

178
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,980
This type is a machine of war or what?

179
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,690
Luffy, I need your belly!

180
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,890
What?

181
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,700
Well! It is finished!

182
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,820
Finally. It is one night calm and quiet.

183
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,320
Hein? What do I card-index outside?

184
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,380
Such an amount of worse, with the dodo.

185
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,640
Incredible. It beat the 4 agents.

186
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,120
They however had a number lower than 12!

187
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,620
But, by where one flees?

188
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,010
One of fout!
Planquons us until they leave the island.

189
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,760
Unluckies!

190
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,830
At… Wait!

191
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,590
One did not flee… One…

192
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,210
Please.
Known as nothing with the Boss!

193
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,840
Wait!

194
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,250
This city is well agitated

195
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,470
whereas one is still in middle of the night.

196
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,710
Which wound that one ordered to us to come here in first line.

197
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,600
I cannot rot here.

198
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,640
I have an important mission to fill!

199
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,570
You are really pathetic.

200
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
You to make beat by a poor wretch swashbuckler.

201
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,920
Mr. 5!
Valentine miss!

202
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,790
You card-index yourselves, it is to us that?

203
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,100
You construct now the ditch which separates us.

204
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,910
You came here to make fun you of us?

205
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,410
Yes, amongst other things.

206
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,220
Of course, we also we have a mission to achieve.

207
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,520
Thank you.

208
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,180
Thanks to your assistance,

209
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,950
one will regulate his account to him.

210
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,690
It is true.

211
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,240
Please, you of him occupy!

212
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,130
You foutez yourselves us?

213
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,610
You believe that one is there in reinforcement?

214
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,480
You believe that one came until this part of Large Line to help you?

215
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,500
How?

216
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,890
Then, which is your mission?

217
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,610
With my opinion, you know it already.

218
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,000
The Boss sent bus of the criminals here to us hide in this city.

219
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,670
The exact words of the Boss are:

220
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,080
Somebody bored my secrecy.

221
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,320
Obviously, I do not know this secrecy.

222
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,580
But the directive first of our organization is “discretion”.

223
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,640
Consequently, we do not tolerate any investigation on the identity of our members.

224
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,660
And if somebody were to learn the secrecy from the Boss,

225
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,970
it is obvious that this somebody should be eliminated.

226
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,800
Therefore, we made an investigation to discover which could have bored the secrecy of the Boss.

227
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,570
The result was surprising!

228
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,920
We discovered that important members of a kingdom had infiltrated Baroque Works!

229
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,410
Of a kingdom?

230
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,990
Atten… Wait!

231
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,450
I in vain carry a crown, I am not really king!

232
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,140
It is to give me a style!

233
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,500
We did not speak about you!

234
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,660
The spies are not other than people having disappeared from the kingdom of Arabasta.

235
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,300
We are discovered!

236
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,120
We are rotten…

237
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,620
Burst!!!

238
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,920
I will not let to you touch the Princess!

239
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,570
On my name of Captain of the Royal Guard of Arabasta, I will prevent you!

240
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,940
Igaram-Kun!

241
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,490
The spies are:the Captain of the Royal Guard of Arabasta, Igaram,

242
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,370
and the Princess Nefertari Vivi.

243
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,210
By order of the Boss of Works Baroque,
you must be eliminated.

244
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,710
Eh well…

245
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,160
And Luffy which is still in bottom…

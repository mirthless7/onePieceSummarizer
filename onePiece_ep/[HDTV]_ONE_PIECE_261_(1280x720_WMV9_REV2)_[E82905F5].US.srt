00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,590
History of Toilets 7:

2
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,590
Long Revenge

3
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,440
We are there!!

4
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,640
We came to Water 7 to repair Going Merry

5
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,640
and to find a companion among the carpenters.

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,360
All is so enormous!

7
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,960
When suddenly, it occurred downtown something from unexpected.

8
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,210
Robin literally disappeared.

9
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,860
CP9.

10
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,640
Where is Robin?

11
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,590
Several indices led us in the Ice old man.

12
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,340
Over there we found Robin and a goupe assassins of the government, the CP9.

13
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,890
Me also I have hope to regulate with you.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,020
Robin!

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,840
Why are you with this band of hypocrites?

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,220
If you want to leave, explains clearly why?

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,870
For exaucer my wish.

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,950
A wish that I could not exaucer near you.

19
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,980
Go ahead, Nico Robin.

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,220
Finally, Zoro and me were beaten by the type with the pigeon,

21
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,980
and Robin east flees without really being explained.

22
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,480
Which is this wishes which it cannot exaucer auprès us?

23
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,480
I will say to you what I know.

24
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,600
Luffy!!

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,420
Robin for dying for our good!

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,780
Robin delivered himself of itself to protect us from an attack of the government.

27
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,210
There is not to reflect.

28
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,030
One takes a boat and one continues them.

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,950
He does not have anything else to make.

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,370
, You wait others!

31
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,440
If you are ready to die, follow me.

32
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,550
Found!!

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,820
He is too coool!!

34
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,960
Super!!

35
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Now, dear pirates, take care not to fall from the train.

36
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,480
To be able to fanchir Aqua Laguna,

37
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,690
We embarked on board second Umi Resha, Rocket Man.

38
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,070
We made peace with engineers Galley it and Fanky Family

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,060
and put the course on the Legal island Enies Lobby.

40
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,770
One goes there!!

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,010
To find…

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,870
Our invaluable Nakama Robin.

43
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,960
Why does that occur like that?

44
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,130
I clearly did you my good-byes.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,950
I would never return in the crew.

46
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,490
You think that they will be content if they sacrifice a friend right to save them-even?!

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,310
Now that they know why you left…

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,390
They will continue you until in hell,

49
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,390
and all your enemies will destroy!

50
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,600
It is you who do not include/understand!

51
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,880
I did not ask to be saved!

52
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,260
Remain apart from that!

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,270
Why this din, Nico Robin?

54
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,270
“Ramen Kenpou Menkui Knocker”

55
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,660
Weeding

56
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,760
“Hentai”

57
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,770
Transformation!

58
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,530
Recognized!

59
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,930
Me known as step only it…

60
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,270
Franky Kentaurusu

61
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,760
It is the reverse! Your body is with back!

62
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,540
Nitoryu Iaï

63
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,750
Rashomon

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,070
It is not finished yet.

65
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,590
It is what that?!

66
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
It is a King of the seas!

67
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,300
He is right in front of…

68
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,040
That which sliced it.

69
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,890
How everyone turns over in the preceding coach!

70
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,040
It is a trap.

71
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,310
What…?

72
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,710
To let itself trap by the enemy, is a failure,

73
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,490
A shame with life.

74
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,620
Hello everyone and good voyage.

75
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,470
I must join Umi Resha,

76
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,180
and the criminals who have to attack us.

77
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,470
If I am again unable to prevent such a thing…

78
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,690
The blood of many civil agents will be versed.

79
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,900
Even if I must run on water,

80
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,870
I have the role of returning justice;

81
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,880
even if these furious waves consume me hands and feet,

82
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,670
I will protect without fault the future from the innocent ones!

83
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:07,810
The Cutter of Demon Zoro VS the Trenching one of T-Bone Boat

84
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,162
What is it?

85
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,162
Umi Resha…

86
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,472
New Umi Resha?

87
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,442
There is somebody.

88
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:18,952
What is it?

89
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,412
A man? There is somebody!

90
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:29,572
It… It is the “trenching one of boat”.

91
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:31,242
Be serious for you?

92
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:32,432
The trenching one of boat?

93
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:36,392
A captain of the Q.G of the Navy, Tancheur de Bateau T-Bone.

94
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:39,802
A man who cuts the pirate boats like steaks.

95
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,192
He! It is impressive!

96
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,162
Impressing, you say! It would be said that you admire it!

97
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,622
Something should be done.

98
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:49,862
Oï, the guy, prepare the gun.

99
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:51,022
You dispatch!

100
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:00,872
Wait!

101
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:06,502
What is there? If nothing is done, Rocket Man will be made cross into two!

102
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:08,912
You did not look at well presently.

103
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:10,372
Let make Zoro,

104
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:11,552
do not intervene.

105
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,262
I would say it only once!

106
00:11:21,452 --> 00:11:22,832
Release the way!

107
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:32,582
While passing way consequently, they did not can circumvent the coaches of my soldiers.

108
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,182
What did they make with my soldiers?

109
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,322
Companions of Nico Robin?

110
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:44,152
Therefore, this sword-man it is the hunter of pirates!

111
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:48,252
This way leads directly to the seat of Justice.

112
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:53,512
I am to it Capitaine of the Q.G of the Navy.

113
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:55,382
I will stop you,

114
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:59,032
leave to cut you into two if necessary!

115
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,462
Ca will not arrive.

116
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:02,952
The place which we want to reach

117
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:05,842
is far behind you

118
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,432
This type is strong.

119
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:14,932
Approaches!

120
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,842
I hate the indirect combat.

121
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,632
Chokkaku CHICHO

122
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,632
Santoryu Gyuuki

123
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:38,742
Bone Oodori

124
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:56,702
It cut it!?!

125
00:12:57,842 --> 00:12:58,692
Yuzume

126
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:17,802
Roronoa!

127
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,992
It overcame trenching boat!

128
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:35,072
To run since the taken down coaches,

129
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:38,232
to catch up with Umi Resha by this storm

130
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,312
is admirable.

131
00:13:40,312 --> 00:13:42,242
But nothing will stop us.

132
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,622
Your Justice is certainly imposing,

133
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:49,082
But also let us have we a strong motivation.

134
00:13:57,942 --> 00:13:58,582
You dispatch!

135
00:13:58,892 --> 00:13:59,592
You dispatch!

136
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:02,522
Supervise although the T-Bone captain did not fall to water!

137
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:06,022
Umi Resha perhaps already caught up with it and…

138
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,942
Stop a little! Do not speak about defeat.

139
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:12,182
The Captain will cut this Umi resha into two, you will see!

140
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,472
But the force of this sword-man leaves the ordinary one.

141
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,212
Ahead all!

142
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:22,042
For the Captain who fought against a King of the seas to protect us!

143
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:23,322
Let us save the Captain!

144
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:25,322
Ouais!!

145
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:41,322
Roronoa Zoro, you will regret it.

146
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,582
I included/understood!

147
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:56,672
Yes, it is Sanji-kun and the others which took down the coaches.

148
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:58,892
Then, one soon will catch up with them?

149
00:14:59,152 --> 00:14:59,972
Probably.

150
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:02,892
Yosh! The enemy approaches!

151
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:12,612
Go ahead Rocketman! One will roll the type with the pigeon.

152
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:57,512
It would be said that…

153
00:15:58,412 --> 00:15:59,672
I made some a little too much.

154
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,432
Not…

155
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:29,562
It is that, it is this odor.

156
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,752
This odor of pirates empeste the part.

157
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:36,372
Definitively equivocal.

158
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:45,692
A problem?

159
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:55,972
He!

160
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,602
Why?

161
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:59,742
It returns by here!!

162
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:21,742
You cut me.

163
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,582
Hein? I am not cut?!

164
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:36,342
If you put all your heart there, it does not matter the ingredients, they will be good.

165
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:41,242
A knife is not a saber. I do not cut the men.

166
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:44,882
Only, understand that without your armor you have…

167
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:45,722
Hosho Naga

168
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:49,272
Dumb!

169
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:50,232
Eye

170
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,272
My eyes are ratrés!!

171
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:56,872
“Returned”.

172
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,652
Go, keep silent yourself and gives up.

173
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,352
Imbecile, and what still?

174
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:10,242
Initially, I do not include/understand why you want to save this woman.

175
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:16,662
You do not know his true nature.

176
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:17,522
Nose

177
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:18,762
Play

178
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:19,752
Stop

179
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:20,832
Teeth

180
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:22,592
Chin

181
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,252
If you say a word moreover, I remake you the portrait.

182
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:32,562
Wait.

183
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:35,422
My face became deformed. Stop!

184
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,532
Since you are unaware of it, I you will say it.

185
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:46,092
Everyone knows that in truth it is a dirtiness of demon!

186
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:50,032
Shot trimming

187
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:09,132
My face is deformed!

188
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:10,122
One to mirroir, one to mirroir!

189
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,892
How you dared to arrange my nose and my eyes of this way!

190
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,312
It is well done!

191
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:39,822
You are a demon!

192
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,572
Oh! Ca returns one would say.

193
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,942
It is true, it returned a little bit.

194
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,372
It is an aberration.

195
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:55,652
You have committed… three crimes.

196
00:19:56,952 --> 00:20:01,182
Firstly:you said yourself cook chief in front of me.

197
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:05,272
Deuxio:you played with and wasted food.

198
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:10,242
Thirdly:you insulted our companion!

199
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:23,652
When one has that mouth, one finishes like that.

200
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:31,322
I always wait to see the power of the centaur about which you spoke.

201
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,772
I will fall.

202
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:49,352
Which pathetic situation.

203
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,192
Do I save you?

204
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,522
Species of dumb!

205
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:06,992
Not, not.

206
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:29,402
What do you save me? I do not need any, moron!

207
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,282
I have finally to catch you.

208
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:37,282
You wanted to know the force of this form, you will feel it!

209
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,672
Farm jerk!

210
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,982
Return to me my appearance!

211
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:53,772
I have a companion behind this door which waits until I come to save it.

212
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,032
If you included/understood, releases the passage.

213
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:04,312
If I have say that you would not pass, you will not pass.

214
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:06,342
Ramen Kenpo Arms hidden:

215
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:08,112
Menkiri Dokubocho

216
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:08,412
note:slice noodle empoisonné*

217
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:10,462
If you it you keys, you die.

218
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,762
Its its its its!

219
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:16,832
You are sure not to be to you made berner by this woman?

220
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:21,162
She betrayed, and still betrayed, in the world of darkness where she lived until today.

221
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:22,742
The worst of the women.

222
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,682
Your life is with me!

223
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:32,622
San ten Cutting

224
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:44,982
Shao… I am dependant feet and fists!

225
00:23:46,212 --> 00:23:47,692
I lowered my guard.

226
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:50,062
Your guard?

227
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:53,512
Enough excuses.

228
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:05,002
What would you say to say some words of good-bye, frangin?

229
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:11,042
Do not think that the combat will continue.

230
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:12,002
What?

231
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:16,872
Since you have to avoid all my blows until now,

232
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:23,732
You do not know the destroying force of my only fist.

233
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:29,912
Ultimate Hammer

234
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:22,662
Do Yo, from where you come?

235
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:26,942
And you? You débarassé yourself type with the ramen?

236
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:28,202
At the moment.

237
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:42,912
Then it is them which removed Robin-chan.

1
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:14,730
Fruit of the Zoan Family!

2
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:14,730
Chopper and its 7 Levels of Transformation

3
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,100
You think that you can destroy this flag?

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,700
The tête de mort symbolizes our conviction!

5
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,720
Luffy!

6
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,350
Into full in the thousand!

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,410
I dispatched you in the airs, microbe!

8
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,740
You see… it is not destroyed!

9
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,030
Impossible! It is nutcase!

10
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,660
I do not know with whom is this pirate flag, nor from where it comes…

11
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,020
but it is a flag for which one engages his life!

12
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,940
One does not defend it with the light one!

13
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,500
IT IS NOT a FLAG WHICH YOU CAN HAVE FUN TO CLEAN UP!!

14
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,880
Narcotic…

15
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,760
It is thus that a pirate!

16
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,200
You see!

17
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,950
It is the symbol of a will which defies the impossible one!

18
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,410
As a doctor, I must save this country!

19
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,860
While raising this flag, I will fight like a pirate!

20
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,570
It is what a pirate?

21
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,310
They are excellent sailors.

22
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,320
It is brilliant to be a pirate!

23
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,190
There are thousands of incredible people on the seas!

24
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,520
One of these days, Chopper, you should take the sea…

25
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,140
Eh! The reindeer!

26
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,500
I will put a beating to them!

27
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,830
What do you hope to make?

28
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,370
I…

29
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,700
You me threats?

30
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,580
Stupid snotty-nosed kid!

31
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,950
Since are so impatient for you to protect this flag, then does not move of a hair!

32
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,120
Maintaining that is enough.

33
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,910
Its column released!

34
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,890
It is obvious, considering the way in which it is agitated.

35
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,350
With what you do play, band of larvae?

36
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,540
Satisfy you to benefit from the spectacle. I will reduce it in ashes!

37
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,210
Burst, Straw hat!

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,980
DECREE!

39
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,250
Well!

40
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,400
Deal with him, the reindeer!

41
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,820
Wapol-Sama! Caution!

42
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,570
It was time that the little runt shows what it has in the belly!

43
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,540
No the bowl! I will not let myself pose a finger on Wapol-Sama!

44
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,690
Eh well, you are funny of creature.

45
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,700
You must be the yéti which threw into a panic the peasants, six years ago.

46
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,890
You probably did not should have made you only one companion of all your life.

47
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,530
Poor wretch monster!

48
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
For which reason do try you to save this country?

49
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,690
It is stupid!

50
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,710
CLOSE it!

51
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,410
Even if I do not have any companion…
I can still fight!

52
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,210
As long as the flag of the Doctor will float, I…

53
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,140
Companions, you have some!

54
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,010
I am your companion!

55
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,830
Straw hat!

56
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,320
You are not wounded?

57
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,540
I am well.
I am out of rubber.

58
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,470
Out of rubber?!

59
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,290
Eh, the reindeer. You think of being able to finish some with this guy?

60
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,990
Without any problem.

61
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,750
Then, it is perfect.

62
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,080
In this case, I will deal with Jamagushi!

63
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,470
Straw hat, species of villain!

64
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,800
How oses you to act of the kind!?

65
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,390
I will not hesitate any more.

66
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,910
You think of being able to overcome me?

67
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,700
Hein, the monster?

68
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,820
Old woman… degenerated witch……!

69
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,900
Let to me fight…!

70
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,360
Quiet remainder and looks at.

71
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,280
If you still move, you will be able remarcher never again.

72
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,690
Be not made a bile.
My small reindeer leaves itself there very well.

73
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,020
My name is Tony Tony Chopper!

74
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,000
It was given to me by the eminent doctor of the world!

75
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,480
The Doctor was too lenient to be annoyed your mockeries!

76
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,470
But me, I do not tolerate it!

77
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,000
It is you which are intolerable!

78
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,520
One will crush you!

79
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,990
Rumble Ball!

80
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,320
Dalton-San! Dalton-San!

81
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,370
You awake! Please, Dalton-San!

82
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,160
Vivi…

83
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,080
Go!

84
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,590
Dalton-San! Dalton-San!

85
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,450
Dalton is in life.

86
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,140
Isshi-20!

87
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,940
Its body is simply cold.

88
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,400
Do you want that one deals with him?

89
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,480
Eh, there are doctors here.

90
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,960
I thought that there was none in this country of it!

91
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,210
They are Isshi-20, the personal doctors of Wapol.

92
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,450
They are doctors of the evil!

93
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,170
Yes, one cannot trust them!

94
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,870
They were subjected to the royal authority of Wapol!

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,820
And they want that one entrusts the fate of Dalton-San to them?!

96
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,080
What want you to make in Dalton-San?!

97
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,320
If you want that he lives, let make us!

98
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,980
We are above all the doctors.

99
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,540
We inclined ourselves in front of the power of Wapol…

100
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,690
… only with an aim of advancing our medical research.

101
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,670
But that always was for the casualties and the patients of this country!

102
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,260
A certain doctor taught us never not to give up…

103
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,520
We will not lose any more…

104
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,990
… of the men of this hardening!

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,110
The effects of Rumble Ball last 3 minutes.

106
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,680
Thus in 3 minutes, I will have overcome you!

107
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
3 minutes?!

108
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,960
How if a runt as you could beat me in 3 minutes!

109
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,580
3 minutes? Incredible!

110
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,290
3? Incredible!

111
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,100
The things will become interesting.

112
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,710
What a pitches! Let to me also fight…!

113
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,900
Rumble!

114
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,960
And that…

115
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,790
believe you to be able to make?!

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,090
Marimo arrow of the fonte des neiges

117
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,650
Walk not:Reinforce the speed of walk

118
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,590
Ha! I wondered what you were going to do!

119
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,300
Like that, you have the capacity of a Fruit of the Demon.

120
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,530
A Fruit of the Zoan Family, like Dalton!

121
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,570
You are a reindeer anthropoïde?

122
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,000
Heavy not:Reinforce the physical force

123
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,270
Error, I am a man-reindeer!

124
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,570
It is the similar one with same.

125
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,920
I know all the Zoan Family and of his 3 transformations!

126
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,420
Super Marimo Surprise
Four Hammers

127
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,720
From now on, we saw all your metamorphoses!

128
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,760
You are a combatant in power, like Dalton!

129
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,260
However, with the pure force, you will not be able…

130
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,830
Jumping not:Reinforce the power of jump

131
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,940
… to overcome me!

132
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,970
A jump? What a powerful jump!

133
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,340
What?!

134
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
What a is this appearance?!

135
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,440
It was not its semi-human form of presently?!

136
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Astute!

137
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,150
Guard not:Reinforce the fur

138
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,810
Still one!?

139
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,360
Impossible! It was a blow imparable!

140
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,830
But useless.

141
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,010
The transformations of the Zoan Family should not exceed 3 metamorphoses!

142
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,880
But which devil are you?

143
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,580
Rumble Ball is a drug which disturbs the waves of the transformations of the Fruit of the Demon.

144
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,010
At the time of my five years of research, I discovered 4 other transformations.

145
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,250
In addition to the 3 known transformations!

146
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,260
7 levels of transformation?!

147
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,220
It does not matter the number of transformations which you have!

148
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,110
7 transformations!

149
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,820
What a formidable reindeer!

150
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,470
What arrives to him?

151
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,200
One would say to hear 7 levels of transformation got strong feelings to him.

152
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,160
Cretin, and our combat then?!

153
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,210
What, 7 levels of transformation?!

154
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,590
Your tours de passe-passes will not go against me!

155
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,460
It is not a turn!

156
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,340
ARM not:Reinforce the force of the arm

157
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,950
I must warn you that my steel shoes can even pourfendre the rock!

158
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,750
Super!

159
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,140
Arrogant good-for-nothing!

160
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,330
You will see!

161
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:58,620
Surprised Marimo:Four Axes

162
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,460
Sharp snow

163
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,880
He He! Ca transpierced the wall of the castle!

164
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,940
Shit, it dodged it.

165
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,390
And what do you think of that?

166
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,840
Take that!

167
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
Snowstorm

168
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,250
Where your beautiful arrogance passed?!

169
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,860
You cannot overcome me by escaping!

170
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,920
Brain not:Reinforce the intelligence

171
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,120
I did not seek to flee.

172
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,000
I sought right tone weak point.

173
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,310
What?!

174
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,490
It is finished.

175
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,830
One… a rayon laser!

176
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,120
It will draw a rayon laser!

177
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,840
Anything, stunned!

178
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,500
You want to keep silent yourself well!?

179
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,630
Ca will be a rayon laser!

180
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,020
Without any doubt, it is a rayon laser
! A laser! A laser!

181
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,010
But how you can the knowledge?!

182
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,050
I know that it is a rayon laser!

183
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,050
But it is impossible!

184
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,790
It is the moment to attack.

185
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,280
You me scannes?!

186
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,660
And then?!

187
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,740
I do not have a weak point!

188
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,010
You are only one weak and lamentable animal of circus!

189
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,350
It is the end for you!

190
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,340
I found!

191
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,980
Its chin!

192
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,180
Where it is?!

193
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,140
Sharp shoe!

194
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,190
3 minutes.

195
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,990
You succeeded! The reindeer!

196
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,810
Good job! The reindeer!

197
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,080
Incredible!

198
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,540
Keep silent yourself!

199
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,920
Dalton-San!

200
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,910
We should climb the mountain.

201
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,820
Usopp-San, Mr. Bushido.

202
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,630
One can remain there, with nothing to make!

203
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,810
I am anxious not to know what it is occurred of Luffy-San and others after this enormous avalanche!

204
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,500
Nami-San has a terrible fever…

205
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,620
Perhaps even…

206
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,640
Be anxious for you for Nami.

207
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,300
Moreover, you are also anxious for Dalton-San and Arabasta?

208
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,900
Vivi, calms itself.

209
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,360
You carry a too heavy burden on your shoulders.

210
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,590
Nami is with Luffy and Sanji. They will be left there.

211
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,180
One should not worry. I have faith in them!

212
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,350
I see, it is right undoubtedly…

213
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,050
Usopp-San has faith in his/her companions.

214
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,010
It is for that there can remain also calm.

215
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,880
Thank you, Usopp-San. I…

216
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,420
You ace right jitter to climb the mountain.

217
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,810
But you heard them!

218
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,750
There are giant yétis and rabbits!

219
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,270
You should have started by saying that!

220
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,300
Do not worry you, Luffy will leave itself there.

221
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,480
The alarming things frighten me, that poses a problem to you?!

222
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,840
Dalton-San!

223
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,980
Have-await, please!

224
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,260
Dalton-San!

225
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,400
Dalton-San!

226
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,680
Will somebody to finally say me who is this guy?

227
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,270
Dalton-San! You cannot leave!

228
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,720
Leave me!

229
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,560
I do not want that Wapol takes again the castle.

230
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,560
Never!

231
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,670
You do not think all the same of returning to you to the castle?!

232
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,730
In your state, it is unconsciousness!

233
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,460
If I do not fight now, then when will I do it?

234
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,930
If I allow Wapol to take again the capacity,

235
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,730
this country will be nothing any more but ruin for eternity!

236
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,340
But you cannot beat you in your state!

237
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,960
And we are not size vis-a-vis him…

238
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,060
It does not matter the sacrifices…

239
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,560
I will finish some now!

240
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,800
Go up! I will carry you to the castle.

241
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,420
No time to lose!

242
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,440
I do not want that your determination is vain!

243
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,730
Usopp-San…

244
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,540
Wait…

245
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,890
I will carry you…

246
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,360
to… the castle…

247
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,020
Usopp-San.

248
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,750
He, Usopp-Kun. I do not think that will go.

249
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,200
Of course that if, that will go!

250
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,630
I will bring you to it!

251
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,790
You fight for your country, not true?!

252
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,440
You want to finish some?!

253
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,490
You do not worry, I you will bring to it no matter what it arrives.

254
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,330
Which cretin.

255
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,320
It should just be brought in top of the mountain, it is that?

256
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,490
Zoro.

257
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,070
Dumb! Dumb! Be to you that a dumb!

258
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,060
Usopp Punch!

259
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,530
What you insane?!

260
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,740
I was about to release all my power!

261
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,530
Ouais.

262
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,510
I know well.

263
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,550
All my power!

264
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,390
Yes, yes.

265
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,010
Wait!

266
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,050
If you make a point so much of going there…

267
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,070
There is a cable which leads to the castle.

268
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,380
Impossible. I believed that all the cables had been destroyed.

269
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,240
There remains one about it!

270
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,610
Somebody set up a white cable…

271
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,920
On the basis of a giant at the exit of Gyasta and driving tree to the castle!

272
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,650
Gyasta?

273
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,270
It is the name of the last village where Doctor Kureha went!

274
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,700
Eh, Luffy!

275
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,930
What?

276
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,720
Where did it pass?

277
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,730
It?

278
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,740
It left!

279
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,930
But which?

280
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,180
This person who is damned guy with the steel teeth! It disappeared!

281
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,160
It came to back from the hairy hippo, it thus did not can go down again.

282
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,810
When devil it could…

283
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,760
When you were occupied with you extasier in front of the transformations, obviously!

284
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,680
What a jerk!

285
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,870
When I find it, I will regulate his account to him!

286
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,960
Would it have threaded into soft in the castle…?

287
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,250
If it is the case, then Nami-San…!

288
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,230
What a dumb! If ever it touches in Nami-San, I will make him pay with the centuple!

289
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,610
Wait!

290
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,000
Frankly, he really seeks with clamser?

291
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,750
Doctorine…

292
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,070
This guy, it said that I was…

293
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,000
his/her companion.

294
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,220
Where do you hide you?

295
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,100
Jamagushi?!

296
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,740
My fever dropped much.

297
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,250
This train, I soon will be able to turn over to the boat.

298
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,650
But what I make?!

299
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,360
I do not have time to remain lengthened in this bed!

300
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,010
Vivi must await me.

301
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,940
But what occurred here?

302
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,320
It is well the castle of Drum?

303
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,570
What did it make with my splendid castle?

304
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,020
It is unforgivable!

305
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,050
I one by one will crunch them until the last!

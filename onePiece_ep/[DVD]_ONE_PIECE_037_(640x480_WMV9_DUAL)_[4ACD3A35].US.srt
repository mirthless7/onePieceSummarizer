1
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,110
What is that look in your face...

2
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,810
You want your village back that badly?

3
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,269
You want your village back that badly?

4
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,354
You want your village back that badly?

5
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:32,054
I make you a deal,
If you want it back...

6
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:33,854
What is it!?

7
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,154
I see...

8
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,115
Get 100 million beli for me.

9
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,699
Get 100 million beli for me.

10
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,995
I'll set you and your village free.

11
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,079
Really?

12
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:46,708
If there's money involved, I would
rather die than break a promise.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,169
If there's money involved, I would
rather die than break a promise.

14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:49,294
If there's money involved, I would
rather die than break a promise.

15
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,503
I don't care how many years it takes.

16
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:50,879
I don't care how many years it takes.

17
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,171
I don't care how many years it takes.

18
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:51,379
I don't care how many years it takes.

19
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,422
I'll keep my end of the deal.

20
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:52,964
I'll keep my end of the deal.

21
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:53,414
I'll keep my end of the deal.

22
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:58,336
Get her!

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,170
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

24
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,587
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

25
00:02:59,587 --> 00:02:59,921
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

26
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,255
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

27
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:00,547
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

28
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:00,964
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

29
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:01,214
I'll gather 100 million beli, no matter what!

30
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,342
Bellemere-san, I'll do it!

31
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,344
No matter how long it takes!

32
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:14,944
LUFFY STANDS UP!
END OF A BROKEN PROMISE!

33
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:22,986
Gen-san...

34
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:23,319
Gen-san...

35
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:23,570
Gen-san...

36
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:24,237
And the Marines?

37
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:24,529
And the Marines?

38
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:24,988
And the Marines?

39
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,539
Are you Nami, the thief?

40
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:41,797
We heard by safe source that your
hiding big amount of stolen money...

41
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:42,797
As of now, we, the government will confiscate it

42
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:45,300
As of now, we, the government will confiscate it

43
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:47,635
all the goods you have stolen.

44
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:47,802
all the goods you have stolen.

45
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,685
What's the matter? Didn't you hear me?

46
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,438
It's decided that all the stolen pirate goods

47
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,939
will be taken into our custody.

48
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,775
will be taken into our custody.

49
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,903
Well, well.

50
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,198
How diligent you guys are in your duties.

51
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:11,242
You don't have the courage to stand up to pirates,

52
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,578
so you pick on smaller game to raise your standings.

53
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:14,245
How noble.

54
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:14,496
How noble.

55
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:15,580
How noble.

56
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,418
Let me tell you something.

57
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,837
I'm one of Arlong's crew.

58
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,840
Touch me, and Arlong won't stay quiet about it.

59
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:31,763
Is that your idea of threatening me, little girl?

60
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,182
Find the treasure!

61
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:36,768
Wait!

62
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,651
ST0P!!

63
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:52,617
Is this what the Marines do now?!

64
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,371
Arlong's gang is killing people and destroying villages!

65
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:57,664
You know it!

66
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:01,876
Even now they're taking over this
island, and wrecking lives!

67
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:06,131
To ignore that and take care of one measly thief,

68
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,799
Is that what you should be doing now?!

69
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,760
Don't talk as if you're superior.

70
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,470
Continue the search.

71
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:12,595
Continue the search.

72
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:17,308
The people of this island have been waiting
for the Marines, help for so long.

73
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:20,979
How can you pass them by
and come straight to me?!

74
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,940
Captain, this orange orchard
seems a little suspicious.

75
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:24,774
Dig it up.

76
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,990
Don't touch Bellemere-san's orchard
with your filthy hands!

77
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,828
I won't give you my money!

78
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,246
That money is for...

79
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,456
It's for...

80
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,128
THE GIRL'S MONEY IS GOING TO
SAVE COCOYASHI VILLAGE!!

81
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:49,674
Does that make you think you have
the right to take it away, Marine?!

82
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,052
What?

83
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,765
Is one of the little villagers talking
to me, a Marine Captain?

84
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:58,433
Gen-san...

85
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:00,602
How did you...?

86
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:06,941
I've always known, Nami.

87
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:11,905
I'm... gonna...

88
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,950
I'm gonna join Arlong's gang.

89
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:16,951
Nami!

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,122
Nami!

91
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:22,791
Back then. I just couldn't believe what you'd done.

92
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,918
Back then. I just couldn't believe what you'd done.

93
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,586
So I questioned Nojiko.

94
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,005
From then on, everyone in the village knew.

95
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:33,468
That in order to save this village,
you joined Arlong's gang.

96
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:34,469
But, we pretended not to know,

97
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:36,888
But, we pretended not to know,

98
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,808
so that if you ever wanted to run away from Arlong,

99
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:43,353
our hopes wouldn't pull you back into his gang.

100
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,313
Can't be...

101
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,111
What are you guys talking about?

102
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:55,365
Are you saying that the whole village is in
on the theft and wants to be arrested?

103
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,699
Is that it?

104
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:01,079
We're saying that we are fighting for our own lives!

105
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:04,999
Because you Marines can't be relied upon!

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
If you've no intentions of saving this village,

107
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,796
then get the hell out of here!

108
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,383
If you stick around, you'll be Arlong's target as well!

109
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,009
Arlong's target?

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,178
I wonder...

111
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:20,974
You still haven't found it?

112
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,184
It's not like we're searching for a grain of rice!

113
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,477
It's 100 million beli!

114
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,063
Hey, you bastard!

115
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,065
How do you know the amount!?

116
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,610
Ah. 100 million.

117
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:35,905
Well, I just had a feeling it would
be around that much.

118
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,568
Don't tell me...

119
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,010
Don't tell me Arlong sent you here?!

120
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,971
Who knows...

121
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,307
As government officials,

122
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,144
We're just doing what's necessary
to persecute thieves.

123
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,230
You corrupt bastards!

124
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:12,108
How could the Marines stoop so
low as to be pirates, lapdogs!?

125
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,612
Arlong!

126
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,071
It's here!

127
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,540
This is amazing!

128
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,668
That little girl sure did gather a lot!

129
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,088
But it's all stained with blood and in bad shape.

130
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,423
Who cares? Money is money.

131
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,346
And one third of this is all mine.

132
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,598
Don't touch it...

133
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,600
Don't touch it...

134
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,060
Don't touch it...

135
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:48,478
Nami!

136
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:51,815
Don't touch it...

137
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,983
DON'T TOUCH IT!!

138
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,500
Nami....

139
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:16,840
Nojiko!

140
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,009
NOJIKO!!

141
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,473
A pinwheel, huh?

142
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,818
That was so cool.

143
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:41,030
Oh! I just thought of a good move!

144
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:45,118
Doctor! Doctor!

145
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:48,121
What happened, Gen-san!?

146
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,664
Nojiko's been shot.

147
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:50,749
By who?

148
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,041
The Marines.

149
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,084
Marines?

150
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,086
Nojiko?

151
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:56,796
I... I'm fine.

152
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,883
Arlong was collaborating with the Marines.

153
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:00,759
What?

154
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,887
He turned his back on Nami eight years ago,

155
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,306
and never intended to keep his promise.

156
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:07,599
What!?

157
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:09,392
What? That means...

158
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,061
That bastard! Our Na-chan...!

159
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,229
Na-chan...

160
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:18,485
Nami...

161
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,612
Yo, Nami!

162
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:21,446
What's up?

163
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:22,822
Can I help with something?

164
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,910
You're STILL here?!

165
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:29,496
This is none of your business!

166
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,289
Get off this island!!

167
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:39,547
Arlong...

168
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,674
Arlong!

169
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,635
Arlong!!

170
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,272
If there's money involved,
I would rather die than break a promise.

171
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:52,143
I don't care how many years go by,
l will keep my end of the deal.

172
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,145
ARLONG!!

173
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,485
What's her problem?

174
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:05,281
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

175
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:12,330
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

176
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:17,999
Arlong!!

177
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:22,378
Yo, what's up?

178
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,923
My prized map surveyor...

179
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:27,133
What's that look on your face?

180
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:33,097
Those Marines you sent took all of my money.

181
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:37,268
Didn't you say you would die before you
broke a promise involving money?

182
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,936
Right!?

183
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,062
WHY!?

184
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,856
Exactly when did I break our promise?

185
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:44,776
Don't play dumb! You used the Marines to...

186
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:49,697
When did I break our promise?

187
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:50,907
Tell me.

188
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,250
Dammit...

189
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,709
Dammit!

190
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,002
Dammit!

191
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,799
Is that so? All of your money was taken away?

192
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:10,510
That's unfortunate.

193
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,804
However, a promise is a promise.

194
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:15,807
Unless you bring 100 million beli before my eyes,

195
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,519
I can't release that village.

196
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:22,480
You scum!

197
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,485
It's only 100 million beli.

198
00:12:27,652 --> 00:12:29,863
You can just gather it again.

199
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:36,035
Or are you gonna escape?

200
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:43,004
However, you know if you run away,
I kill everyone in this village...

201
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:49,966
We pretended not to know.

202
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:53,194
So that when you wanted to run away from Arlong,

203
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:56,514
Our hopes wouldn't pull you back into his gang.

204
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:05,106
Running away finally?

205
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,403
It's okay if we don't chase her?

206
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,322
Chase her? Why?

207
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:15,533
There's no way she'd escape.

208
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:20,038
She can't forfeit the lives of the villagers.

209
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,791
But what a devious trick that was.

210
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,129
I can't let a refined mapmaker like Nami get away.

211
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,424
But still, I'm not a demon.

212
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,762
Once she draws up maps of the whole world...

213
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:38,223
Then, I'll set her free.

214
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:43,311
And how many decades will that take?

215
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,564
She can die hundred times before finish it!

216
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,278
Okay!

217
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:55,156
Let's meet up with Luffy as soon as we can!

218
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,284
Hey, Sanji. What are you doing?

219
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:01,246
I'm cherishing this happiness.

220
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,148
What are you talking about?

221
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:06,960
Nami-san has suffered a lot.
Much more than anybody.

222
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:13,675
And I'm going to take away all that suffering.

223
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:16,219
Is there anything better than that?

224
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,014
Your motives are obvious.

225
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:20,974
Love Cook.

226
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,506
That is what a real gentleman do for
a beautiful and suffering ladie...

227
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:28,706
What's wrong with fighting for somebody beautiful?

228
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:31,401
We're doing this for everyone else in the village too.

229
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:32,610
Shut up.

230
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,785
Quit bickering.

231
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:42,704
Let's go.

232
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:49,085
This is as far as it goes!

233
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,087
Get your weapons! We're gonna fight!

234
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,716
YEAH!!

235
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,217
Gen-san...

236
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:57,385
Everyone...

237
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,470
Please! Don't be rash!

238
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,432
You can't die! Everything will be over!

239
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,186
You have to survive! Or everything will be over!!

240
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,146
Eight years ago,

241
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,482
we said we'd never throw our lives away!

242
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,936
That no matter how bad their
abuse against us became,

243
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:16,779
As long as Nami was fine,

244
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:19,315
We were going to continue our fight of endurance!

245
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,785
But this is how they answer back!

246
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:27,373
Now that there's no way for this village to
be free, we have no goal to survive for!

247
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:28,583
Furthermore!

248
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:33,338
We will not forgive them for
preying on Nami's kindness!!

249
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:34,547
Are there any objections!?

250
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,341
No way! Let's go!

251
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:39,969
We're already prepared to fight!

252
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:43,681
We're not gonna take it anymore!

253
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:45,141
YEAH!!

254
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,935
Wait' everybody!
YEAH!!

255
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:49,854
Nami!

256
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,653
Just wait... Just wait a little longer!

257
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,738
I'm going to try again!

258
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:00,907
I'll get the money again!

259
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,244
It'll be easier this time! I have lots of experience!

260
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:07,121
It's okay. You don't have to worry!

261
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:10,667
Compared to that time...

262
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:15,296
I don't want anyone to die anymore!

263
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:17,715
Everybody, I'm fine!

264
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:18,883
I'm fine so...

265
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:28,309
That's enough.

266
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,436
We know what futility is like.

267
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:35,275
You fought well, for our sake.

268
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:38,945
It must have been more painful
for you to join that crew,

269
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,364
more painful than it is to cut yourself.

270
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,784
You fought well.

271
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:47,662
Gen-san...

272
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,212
Now, leave this village.

273
00:16:57,922 --> 00:16:58,673
Gen-san!

274
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,134
Do it, Nami!

275
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:02,760
I can't!

276
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:03,928
Na-chan.

277
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:04,929
Nami

278
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,266
You've got brains,

279
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:09,726
and you've got a dream.

280
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,728
Nojiko! Everybody!

281
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:13,980
I won't let you!

282
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,900
Stop it, everyone!

283
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:20,111
I don't want to see anyone get hurt anymore!

284
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:23,656
You're gonna die.

285
00:17:24,574 --> 00:17:25,742
We know.

286
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,042
It's useless.

287
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,002
We've already decided in our hearts.

288
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,716
Out of the way, Nami!

289
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,386
Let's go, everybody!

290
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:48,640
Even if we can't win, we'll show them our pride!

291
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,350
YEAH!!

292
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,304
Arlong.

293
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,516
ARLONG!!

294
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,642
ARLONG!!

295
00:18:35,436 --> 00:18:36,229
ARLONG!!

296
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,397
ARLONG!!

297
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:38,481
ARLONG!!

298
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,482
ARLONG!!

299
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:40,358
ARLONG!!

300
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,234
ARLONG!!

301
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,277
ARLONG!!

302
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:43,611
Ar...!

303
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:50,618
Luffy...

304
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:55,999
What do you want?

305
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,084
You don't know anything.

306
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,213
You don't know what's been happening
for the past eight years on this island.

307
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:03,756
Yeah. I don't.

308
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,260
This is none of your business!

309
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,430
I told you to get off this island, didn't I?!

310
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,140
Yeah. You told me.

311
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,266
Go away!

312
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:14,851
You!

313
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:16,060
Go away!

314
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,103
Go away!!

315
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,479
Go away!!

316
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:19,647
Go away!!

317
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:20,899
Go away!!

318
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:21,649
Go away!

319
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,401
Go away!!

320
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:24,861
Go away...

321
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,298
Luffy...

322
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:48,468
Help me.

323
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:07,320
DAMN RIGHT!!

324
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,949
Don't touch my treasure!

325
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,369
Luffy...

326
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:24,045
We're going.

327
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:26,798
Right!

328
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:32,136
Hey!

329
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,013
Are you guys okay?

330
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,598
Were you beaten up by Arlong?

331
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:38,601
Out of the way.

332
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:42,689
We've come to see the mermen.

333
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,358
After finding out the truth about Nami-aneki,

334
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:49,279
There was only one thing left to do, beat Arlong.

335
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,948
With that in mind, we came here.

336
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:54,701
But, we lost easily.

337
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,997
No offense, but we ain't moving for you guys.

338
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:00,832
You, who have no chance of winning.

339
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:01,708
What?

340
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:06,421
We're waiting for ''those guys'' to come.

341
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,006
''Those guys''?

342
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,049
Bet your life on it.

343
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:13,011
''Those guys'' will definitely come!

344
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:29,319
There!!

345
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:46,002
Them...

346
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,047
Those guys? What about them...?

347
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:52,050
If those guys can't stand up to them,

348
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,302
Then there's no hope, not only for this island,

349
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,138
But for the whole of East Blue.

350
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:00,808
Remember the faces of those four,

351
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:04,229
that have come to change the future.

352
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,489
Move.

353
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:26,960
Hey, do you think those two idiots
were part of Zoro's gang?

354
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,671
Zoro's gang? They were far too weak.

355
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,464
They weren't even worth killing.

356
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:32,841
So true.

357
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:47,564
What the...?

358
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:52,735
Which one's Arlong?

1
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,100
Run! Run! Run!!!

2
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,499
Have-HAVE-await me!!!

3
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,833
Where can be Going Merry well?!

4
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:17,633
PARTICIPATION OF THE SPECIAL UNIT!
BATTAILLE ON THE BRIDGE!

5
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,299
L remains one as of theirs.

6
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,565
Members of the crew of Straw hat
one their companions gave up.

7
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,099
Anything!

8
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,032
I am Sheperd, an inspector of
general headquarter of the Navy!

9
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,099
Release me…

10
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,299
Inspector?

11
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,499
Warn your superior of it immediately.

12
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,966
The pirates are escaping from Navarone.

13
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,565
Insane steps of us, Konteriano!

14
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,565
Do not try to deceive us, that will not take.

15
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:49,700
Go there!

16
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,566
Konteriano?

17
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:53,433
How that?

18
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,565
Slacken me!

19
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,032
I am not Konteriano.

20
00:02:56,033 --> 00:03:01,033
I am Sheperd! Inspector of
general headquarter of the Navy!

21
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,500
What there is?!

22
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,232
Navy!

23
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,500
On this side too!

24
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,099
That fears, that fears!

25
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,233
One is made like rats!

26
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,900
It is very interesting all that.

27
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,165
The Uncle Fortress had prevented me…

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,765
that it was impossible to escape from this place.

29
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,632
L would seem…

30
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:31,650
that there is more than one thousand of soldiers.

31
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,100
What do you find of interesting in it?

32
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,832
One will see whether it is veracious.

33
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,632
I do not see the interest of it!

34
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,032
They is good, Usopp.

35
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,899
You know well that nobody can
to stop when he wants to fight.

36
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,099
Avoided unit 37!

37
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Unit 44 avoided too!

38
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,900
Capture the crew of Straw hat!

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,566
Quickly! Catch them!

40
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,900
Wait, Straw hat!

41
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,632
But it is…

42
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,300
the crew of Straw hat.

43
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,365
It is a dead end?

44
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,233
Not, one could go along the wall…

45
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,233
Straw hat, you revoilà.

46
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,766
It is the Commander de Navarone.

47
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,366
L is called Jonasan.

48
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,233
Then, Uncle Fortress, where you stays?

49
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,566
In my personal room.

50
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,965
Charge the guns!

51
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,499
Yes, but…

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,499
if one draws with the right in the middle…

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,433
Do not discuss!!!

54
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:45,366
Ah, Lu-Luffy, Luffy!

55
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,833
I had left to lend strong hand to my companions.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,832
As I said it to you, Tonton Fortress,

57
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,632
I will put the veils from here when I would like it.

58
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,832
And how?

59
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,565
Because you do not wish any more to escape from here?

60
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,033
Do not make any you, one will go soon there.

61
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,365
You will have opportunity of leaving Navarone…

62
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:08,365
or to distort me company?

63
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:10,166
One will not be made trap by you…

64
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,633
because one is pirates!!

65
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,700
WILL RUN!!!

66
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,765
They slipped by.

67
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:37,032
Commander!

68
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:41,599
At present, units 7 and 2l
are posted side by side in ambush,

69
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,300
close to the building site naval.

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,166
It is the ideal moment to demolish them.

71
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:51,633
Point out the troops of unit 7.
It would be likely to weaken us.

72
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,025
Wouldn't it be preferable that they remain in position?

73
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:57,965
An ordinary strategy is not likely any to go.

74
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:01,600
Its head is not put at price for
100 million Berry for nothing.

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,565
Our manpower would be likely to undergo heavy losses.

76
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,965
I do not want to make useless sacrifice.
We must remain vigilant.

77
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:11,965
Yes!

78
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:16,632
They will go to the shipyard
in order to recover their ship.

79
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:22,100
We will concentrate our forces with the building site
naval, in order to put the hand on these pirates.

80
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,033
Decree, Straw hat!

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Drake?

82
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,433
Yes!?

83
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,099
Appointment with the shipyard by the short cut.

84
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,499
There lead also the crew of Straw hat.

85
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,232
All the blows are allowed.

86
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,433
YES!

87
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,233
If Drake goes to the building site
unit 88. That risks dêtre long.

88
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,033
Indeed.

89
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,033
To go to the shipyard of unit 88,

90
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,099
they will have inevitably to pass by the bridge.

91
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,899
We will keep an eye on that one…

92
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,032
while supervising them with the accesses of the bridge.

93
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:02,232
Moreover, as long as we will keep the control of the bridge…

94
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,099
In spite of their power, it will be delicate for them to cross it.

95
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,899
We can thus take all our time.

96
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,032
I see.

97
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:12,833
Remain to be seen which unit will be in charge of their capture…

98
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,232
I see only one of them…

99
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:22,500
We are the elite of Navarone!

100
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,566
We will show them our
relentless direction of the capture!

101
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,266
Of course!

102
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:39,166
Please, leave unit 55
to deal with the guard of the bridge.

103
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:43,300
And we will put in Mugiwara failure,
while guaranteeing the safety of the bridge!

104
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,433
I count on you.

105
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,832
Euhh… Excuse me…

106
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,032
What thus?

107
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,300
What does it occur?

108
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,432
Pirates are in escape.

109
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:08,165
It is about Mugiwara.
They are infamous beings.

110
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,365
Several of them infiltrated the base.

111
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,965
What does one have to make?

112
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:15,632
Luffy seems to be last with the action.

113
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:20,765
They surely will go to the building site
naval to recover Going Merry.

114
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,499
Ca wants to say that Luffy already helped Zoro.

115
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,300
One is not drawn from business for as much.
They are unaware of this place very.

116
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,433
Moreover one worked out no plan of escape.

117
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:33,300
To act thus could be to us fatal!

118
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,765
But…

119
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:38,032
maintaining our single solution,
it is to return to us to the shipyard.

120
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:43,100
Yes, then dispatch we to leave
from here and let us join Luffy.

121
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,433
The ball is in their camp

122
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,165
Kobato-san?

123
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,232
Did you know? One of the pirates is
infiltrated as a doctor.

124
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:55,433
You must finish some with this operation.
Let throw an eye inside to us.

125
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,900
Kobato-san?!

126
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:58,966
Kobato-san, open immediately!

127
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,566
They is not good… Not good of the whole…
Kobato-san, open immediately!

128
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,366
He you!

129
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,700
Doctor Kobato…

130
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,633
Afflicted, we misled you.
Indeed, we are pirates.

131
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,500
Please, made attention.

132
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,165
They said to me that pirates
ground in the base.

133
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,832
It is terrible.

134
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,899
They as said me as they were equipped as a doctor.

135
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,499
You are probably in danger.

136
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,965
Eh… Euh. Eh… Well…

137
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:37,965
To be frank, pirates in question…

138
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,366
it is us two.

139
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,166
As I say it to you,
we are pirates!

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,832
But I know that you are somebody
of good, then I count on you.

141
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,699
Say we where is the shipyard?

142
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,966
We do not have time.

143
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:05,300
PIRATES!

144
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,433
This cry at the moment, it was…

145
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,632
Kobato san!

146
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,032
That it occurs?!

147
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:16,833
Kobato-san?!

148
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,365
It occurred something.

149
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,233
Good, one goes there!

150
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,900
Kobato-san!
You are well?!

151
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,632
Kobato-san?

152
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,100
It is there…

153
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,832
You are well?!

154
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,966
He, hold good!

155
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,233
Where can they be well?

156
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,166
They are flee by there, isn't this?

157
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,165
O-Oui!

158
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,700
Dispatch you to catch them!

159
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,233
You are finally awaked, Doctor Kobato.

160
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,632
Afflicted!

161
00:10:56,633 --> 00:11:01,566
I include/understand your reaction.
But can you keep your calm?

162
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:02,966
Nami.

163
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,900
Quickly, it is necessary to benefit from it to slip by.

164
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,365
Yes, I remember…

165
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,666
You are…

166
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,800
Hein? Me? I am…

167
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:19,833
I ate a fruit of the demon which me
allows to metamorphose me.

168
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,833
This type resulting from funny from is ligée…

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,165
Then you see, Doctor Kobato.

170
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,899
I know, it is a history out of the commun run.

171
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,765
But we really do not have
time to tell it to you.

172
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:34,165
They is good, I will not cause you more concern.

173
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,165
We will leave now.

174
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,299
The soldiers can return constantly.

175
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Euh! Wait one minute!
Mister the stag.

176
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,909
You summers a large doctor, even if you are a pirate.

177
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:48,632
You made me become aware
true role of a doctor.

178
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,432
I would like to do something to thank you.

179
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,133
Keep your fine wordss for you.

180
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:57,300
And then I am not a stag,
I am a reindeer!

181
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Forgive me.

182
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:03,099
Yes, therefore you are with research
is shipyard, it that?

183
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,699
Hein?

184
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,032
I will lead you to it.

185
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:07,833
You really can it?

186
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,365
But…

187
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:13,365
Kobato-san would be likely to have troubles
with the soldiers of the base of Navarone.

188
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,500
It is true but…

189
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:21,033
If I am discovered, you will not have
that to say that I am your hostage.

190
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:22,832
Excel.

191
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,100
I hope to be useful to you.

192
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,165
The perimeter is entirely buckled.

193
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,299
Ouais, will be necessary to play it discrete.

194
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,432
Uncle Fortress, it is frightening.

195
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,500
Discretion question, do not be to you the good person.

196
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:45,499
We will be able to rejoin zone 88,
while passing by here.

197
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,500
Going Merry must be moored in the neighborhoods.

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,433
But it would seem that grouille
parasites in the corner.

199
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,633
And if one passed by there?

200
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,032
One can take this way.

201
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,099
That seems to me equivocal.

202
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,632
Y' has anybody.

203
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:05,299
One will be made roast while passing by there.

204
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,700
It is a trap.

205
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:07,900
A trap?!

206
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,566
It does not matter the way to be taken…

207
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,467
one will leave from here.

208
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:16,833
To think of something of shitting, nothing more shitting.

209
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,300
The trap will not work with us.

210
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,832
He Luffy, S-Sanji. Zoro, wait!

211
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,832
Ah… I do not want…

212
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,432
And then even if I sometimes happen to escape from it
I do not know if that will be the case for you!

213
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,566
And if I do not save you, you could die!

214
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,466
You want to always pass by there?

215
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:39,499
But if I am in danger,
I count on you to help itself!

216
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,167
Answer me!

217
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:55,167
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

218
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,967
The place of which you spoke,
towards where it is?

219
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,432
There are several shipyards here.

220
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,232
I think that it is about the building site
naval underground located at the East.

221
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,899
The boat is probably moored
with the quay Is naval base.

222
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,233
In the East? I hope that it acts
of that of zone 88.

223
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,566
Why thus, Kobato-San?

224
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,900
Yes!

225
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,366
Although it is about a shipyard of weak width…

226
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:28,499
it is always empty…
and my father is over there.

227
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,367
It would be although your ship is over there.

228
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,166
What does one make, Nami?

229
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,499
Where does one go?

230
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,966
I precisely put the question.

231
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,499
We do not know anything of this endroi
best, it is to remain on the alert.

232
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,567
But we will follow Doctor Kobato.

233
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,566
Nobody in the neighborhoods.

234
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,432
Ouais.

235
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,699
Y' does not have a cat,
quickly, allons-y!

236
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,232
Oi!

237
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,899
Wait, cretin of Luffy!

238
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,700
It is irremediable.

239
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,300
It is super high! I have too the giddiness!

240
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,832
Woho, here they are!

241
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,700
Wohoho, here they are!

242
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,100
It was a bad idea!

243
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,766
I see…
One will be entitled to a little exercise.

244
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,967
One will leave from here costs whom costs!

245
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,833
We are the elite of Navarone in
capture, and we are in load of the bridge.

246
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,833
We will not let to you pass,
do not even think of it!

247
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,232
Do not pay attention to me.

248
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,099
You can continue your mise en scene,
I have a cigarette to have patience.

249
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,566
Do not take to us with the light one.

250
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:17,433
We are the elite of the Navy based with Navarone!

251
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:22,433
You will see our relentless direction of the capture!

252
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,567
Ooh, that with the air amusing all that!

253
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,367
Go ahead!!!

254
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,499
Zoro!!!

255
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,566
Put yourself at the shelter!

256
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,633
Yes!

257
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,632
Played well, Zoro!

258
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,299
Fight like a brave man!

259
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,299
Prepare well, Straw hat.

260
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
It is too funny that.

261
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,567
Now.

262
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,232
I had studied your technique of combat

263
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,633
Co-how?

264
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,033
You always disturb me at the bad time.

265
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,432
Fact of shitting.

266
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:25,966
It is finished by it of you, now.

267
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,632
Navy of shit.

268
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:31,632
But what you manufacture?!
Put to them a good beating!

269
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,233
This time, I will cut out you out of discs.

270
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
It is what?

271
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
However I struck of all my forces.

272
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
It is the Dial Impact

273
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,567
That does not finish any.

274
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:12,432
Listen well, pirate of shoddy goods.

275
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,899
This warping is the proof of my
membership of the elite of Navarone.

276
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,766
I will fight that with dead if it is needed.

277
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,900
I will not let any pirate cross the bridge.

278
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:24,100
It is what, this whore of nonsense?

279
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,733
That burns!

280
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,167
He, He, put it a little out of night light.

281
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,367
This funny of play is really sympathetic.

282
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,899
It is the moment!

283
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,433
Seize it by the arms!

284
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,632
I will not let myself make this time.

285
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,300
They are tough.

286
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,900
And shit…

287
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:40,633
'

288
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,566
Fact of shitting…

289
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:22,299
You never think of the consequences of your acts.

290
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,032
Afflicted…

291
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,633
Good, one goes there.

292
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,032
By where?

293
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:28,032
By there…

294
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,700
Commander!

295
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:32,299
Part of the bridge was destroyed.

296
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,699
The crew of Mugiwara is in the lake.

297
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,166
There was no death,
nobody knows their current location.

298
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:48,767
Eh well, they are really coriaces.
But, there remain to us still 22 minutes.

299
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:53,699
Unit 55, the direction relentless
capture, hein?

300
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,299
Commander!

301
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,299
Here unit 88.

302
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,167
Their strategy of capture is based
on the optimal effectiveness.

303
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,299
Be sure that we will capture Straw hat.

304
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,966
Well, they have just crossed the bridge.

305
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:10,100
They are very close to you.

306
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,899
You hold ready!

307
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,032
Especially do not neglect any detail.

308
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:16,166
Be on it is to you by there, Usopp?

309
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:19,767
Do not worry you, they are good, it is very right.

310
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,567
They arrive.

311
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,767
Operation captures! It left!

312
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,832
It is an urgency!

313
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,500
You push, please!

314
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,033
Nami-san as a nurse!

315
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,033
It is what any Ca?
Nami-san as a nurse!

316
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,500
Lu-Luffy!

317
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,082
It is not with the smoke-producing ones
that I will close the eyes.

318
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,082
I did not expect from it less my “head of algae”!

319
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,783
Thank you “pretty eyebrow”!

320
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:18,650
You will have wanted it.

321
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,350
Vien not there!
You will have wanted it.

322
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,349
Head of algae!

323
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,216
It is not the moment to dispute!

324
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:25,616
You will never arrive at
to reach your boat!

325
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:28,282
I still do not have a fooorce….

326
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:29,549
Soon in One Part…

327
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,349
Smash the barricade!
Going Merry is recovered!

328
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:38,433
I will become the lord of the pirates!

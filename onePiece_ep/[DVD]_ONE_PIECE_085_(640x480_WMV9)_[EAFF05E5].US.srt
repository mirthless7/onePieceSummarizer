1
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:01,550
The dream of excluded!

2
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:01,550
Hiluluk the charlatan!

3
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,830
Third day.

4
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,670
Progression:the colony of bacteria decreased by 30%.

5
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,250
Be rather gifted for you!

6
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,100
It is for that I adore the monsters!

7
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,660
But what will occur if…

8
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,970
Do Qu- what you make?

9
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,560
It is too funny!

10
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,690
CLOSE it!

11
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,990
RELEASE!

12
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,900
You want to be my companion?

13
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,870
Be really brilliant for you!

14
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,450
C- Companion?

15
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,000
You will be a pirate!

16
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,590
I do not want to be a pirate!

17
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,950
And I do not need companion!

18
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,340
If you become my companion, my friends will be super content!

19
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,370
Wait!

20
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,550
I will not be your companion!

21
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,130
Te insane step of my mouth!

22
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,060
How I said, are really brilliant for you!

23
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,060
You will be my companion!

24
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,460
Nami-San, to help you to find forces.

25
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,900
I prepared you a special meal.

26
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,900
Thank you, Sanji-Kun.

27
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,190
But look at, even exhausted,
Nami-San is always splendid…

28
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,070
Incredible. Who said to you that you could use the kitchen?

29
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,160
Madam, this roast is filled with proteins, that will give him forces!

30
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,890
Do not call me “Madam”.

31
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,160
I am an unmarried flower.

32
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,650
Still so young person, always so young person.

33
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,930
139 is, it that?

34
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,820
Doctorine, help me!

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,610
Remain here!
Eh, wait, wait!

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,410
I hold you, the horned one!

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,690
What you made? Really…

38
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,320
This guy will be our companion.

39
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,450
Oh, really?

40
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,110
I am not agreement!

41
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,810
If!

42
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,460
Not!

43
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,200
If!

44
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,030
You are giving me a headache.

45
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,530
Wait!

46
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,660
Wait, wait!

47
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,900
Companion, hein?

48
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,930
You do not have any idea of what this word represents…

49
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,570
… for him.

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,440
He lived alone.

51
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,530
But one day, it bound friendship with a man.

52
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,330
Its name was Dr. Hiluluk.

53
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,780
It was a charlatan who gave to Chopper his name. He regarded it as his son.

54
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,770
Wait!!!

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,010
You saw it?

56
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,790
Not, I did not see it nowhere.

57
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,020
Hiluluk… This bastard of charlatan!

58
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,490
We must capture it costs whom costs!

59
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,870
It is an order of Wapol-Sama!

60
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,630
Yes!

61
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,850
Shit…

62
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,680
You cannot remain like that longer!

63
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,360
We must call a doctor!

64
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,930
It is without hope.
There is no more doctor in this country.

65
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,290
There remain only those of Wapol, Isshi-20.

66
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,710
I will prosternerai myself in front of Wapol and I will beg it so that Isshi-20 look after you!

67
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,720
I will go there!

68
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,950
It will not be necessary!

69
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,790
I will deal with you.

70
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,780
Hiluluk!

71
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,260
I do not need you!
Leave me quiet!

72
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,100
All those which you looked after were even more badly afterwards!

73
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,420
Would not be so timid.

74
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,310
I have just finished my new miracle treatment.

75
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,770
You are lucky.

76
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,060
Hein? Not, it is not what you believe.

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,190
It is my anesthetic gun.

78
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,050
I use it only when my patients suffer enormously.

79
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,020
I call the guards!

80
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,610
Please, leave!

81
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,810
I will give you all the money which you want!

82
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,630
I will be able to never accept the money of a sick man.

83
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,820
I want only to help you.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,390
Not! Stop!

85
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,320
I have a family…!

86
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,660
It is strange. Would I have used the bad ingredients?

87
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,580
I however thought that my Kaeru X would have functioned.

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
I hate when that does not go.

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
I I excuse myself, I did not want…

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,470
Hiluluk! Are you there?!

91
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,830
Wait!

92
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Ca boume, greenhorn?

93
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,160
Hunting for the doctors touches at his end.

94
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,320
You and me sums the last two doctors of this country.

95
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,520
Wapol despairs to capture us one day.

96
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,220
Even without that, you would remain always the pet peeve of this country.

97
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,070
You are a charlatan of the worst species, after all.

98
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,160
This cursed hunting for the doctors will not be right of me.

99
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,360
I will look after this country with my medicine.

100
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,420
You do not want rather to say “to destroy it”?

101
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,160
There is somebody on the bridge!

102
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,050
We will be re-examined, Charlatan.

103
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,760
I hope well that not, robber salts.

104
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,640
They will never have me.

105
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,040
Even if I am alone, I continue my combat against the diseases!

106
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,750
You above were drawn?

107
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,650
If I do not stop the hemorrhage quickly, you will die!

108
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,400
All is well, I will help you.

109
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,980
The Abominable snowman.

110
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,720
Kill it!

111
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,620
Three days ago, I developed a pomade which can even look after the broken bones.

112
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,780
You have chance.

113
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,340
Do not let it escape!

114
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,540
Kill it!

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,840
Fire!

116
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,900
What are you?

117
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,660
You do not have the air of human being.

118
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,750
Ah yes, you are undoubtedly the Abominable snowman that everyone drives out…

119
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,330
We had it!

120
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,700
Not yet, it is always in life!

121
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,210
You are mistaken on me…

122
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,790
Who…

123
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,720
Who do you believe that I am?

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,720
Eh, wait!

125
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,630
I WILL NOT KILL YOU!

126
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,560
MY NAME EAST DR. HILULUK!

127
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,820
A DOCTOR!

128
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,460
And it is like that Chopper and Hiluluk met.

129
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,910
And what did it occur afterwards?

130
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,600
After Hiluluk accommodated the reindeer…

131
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,410
What? You can speak?

132
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,800
Why did you remain dumb during the last three days?

133
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,740
I thought that if I had spoken, you would have rejected me.

134
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,240
When I tried to speak with human before…

135
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,240
… they drew me above.

136
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,110
The reindeers do not speak, normally.

137
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,150
You can speak, and then?

138
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,900
Me also I speak.

139
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,320
And well better than you.

140
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,060
CUSHY JOB, CHOPPER!

141
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,590
Shit. Another failure!

142
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,690
Do Eh, that go, Chopper?

143
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,930
Eh well, you do not seem to be well.

144
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,960
Why did you call me “Chopper”?

145
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,940
You are Tony Tony Chopper.

146
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,960
“Tony” is a word game with “Tonakai”, which wants to say “reindeer”.

147
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,270
Because you are a reindeer which has fabulous wood which seems to be able to slice a tree.

148
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,910
Pretty name, isn't this?

149
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,970
It is as that which I will call you.

150
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,620
Chopper…

151
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,810
Listen, Chopper.

152
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,780
The patient always should be observed attentively to give him the good drug.

153
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,300
It is like that one saves a life.

154
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,930
Allons-y.

155
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,680
My patients wait.

156
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,220
LEAVE FROM HERE, CHARLATAN!

157
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,060
I was however sure that the eye of triton would go!

158
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,870
Do not threaten me!

159
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,960
Wait!

160
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,090
Let us flee! They are the guards!

161
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,330
Chopper!

162
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,720
One uses the “soft food plan”!

163
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,850
What is it?

164
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,060
Good luck, my friend!

165
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,740
YOU FAILED TO KILL ME!

166
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,280
You had almost died when I found you!

167
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,620
The result would have been the same one, blue truffle!

168
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,620
Do not call me Blue Truffe!

169
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,450
Doctor?

170
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,990
I… was never yet beaten to me with somebody.

171
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,710
Ouais, it is true.

172
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,660
You need an adversary for that.

173
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,690
Well, I think that…

174
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,100
it will be your first time for that too.

175
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,160
It is a gift.

176
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,160
It will be the symbol of our friendship.

177
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,810
A gift?

178
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,490
Friendship?

179
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
You and me close sums, hein?

180
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,510
We are exclude.

181
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,270
But you know…

182
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,730
do not hate the human ones.

183
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,890
This country is sick.

184
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,460
The heart of the King and that of people are suffering.

185
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,000
They say that there is no remedy for this sick country…

186
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,480
… but they are wrong.

187
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,210
As soon as my drug is at the point,

188
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,210
this country will be cured!

189
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,290
Years ago, in the West, in a remote country,

190
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,870
a large robber lived.

191
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,060
He suffered from a serious cardiac disease.

192
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,730
He accepted care of the largest doctors of the country,

193
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,170
but none could cure it.

194
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,090
Filled up rage after having realized that it was going to die,

195
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,830
the man passed by chance in front of a mountain.

196
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,240
And there…

197
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,560
He saw something that he had never seen before!

198
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,800
Cherry trees in flower!

199
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,880
The mountain was entirely covered with cherry trees in flower as he had never seen some!

200
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,130
And,… when the man turned over to see the doctor, it had the surprise of its life.

201
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,720
He says this to him:

202
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,330
“You seem to be in perfect health!”

203
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,760
He was cured!

204
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,850
It was a miracle!

205
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,260
You of agreement, isn't this is?

206
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,360
It was simply a brilliant treatment!

207
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,750
It if was chamboulé that a transformation took place in him!

208
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,740
That wants to say that…

209
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,470
All the diseases of this world can be cured.

210
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,400
It does not matter what people say in connection with me,

211
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,010
I will save this country, because I am a doctor!

212
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,030
And I put this flag at tête de mort to make it float in front of all these diseases!

213
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,330
Tête de mort?

214
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,640
You see!

215
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,360
It is a symbol of my will…

216
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,360
… which will defy the impossible one!

217
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,710
I will save this country… because I am a doctor!

218
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,260
By raising this flag, I will fight like a pirate!

219
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,800
Eh, the reindeer!

220
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,280
Would be my companion!

221
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,520
Wow, that with the delicious air!

222
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,460
It is brilliant to be a pirate!

223
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,080
Is doctor, what it, a pirate?

224
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,530
A pirate?

225
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,350
The pirates are the Masters of the seas.

226
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,100
They have a hard body like the rock, the piercing eyes of an eagle,

227
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,600
and a voice able to slice the sky into two!

228
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,270
Es you really a pirate?

229
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,480
Yes, I am one.

230
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,390
This is why you should be my companion.

231
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,030
They is super to be a pirate!

232
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,060
One sings.

233
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,190
To sing?

234
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes, and the pirates dance too.

235
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,750
Do the pirates do that!?

236
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,170
Yes, and we live full with venture!

237
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,170
Adventures?

238
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,780
Do the pirates live really adventures?

239
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,970
You want to bet?

240
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,490
The pirates risk their life and live extraordinary adventures!

241
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,950
One meets heaps of incredible people!

242
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
It is brilliant to be a pirate!

243
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,890
There are thousands of incredible people in the world!

244
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,130
Chopper, take the sea one of these days.

245
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,240
You will realize how much your fears and your concerns are actually nothing.

246
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,750
This island where you were born, compared with the rest of the world…

247
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,580
is as large as that.

248
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,220
Really?

249
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,760
Not, smaller still!
Only large like that!

250
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,160
I am serious!

251
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,120
Your future extends well beyond this sea!

252
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,910
Happiness is transitory.

253
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,910
And…

254
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,870
The time of the good-byes always arrives.

255
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,100
Who who you are.

256
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,050
Ca makes one year.

257
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,450
You are completely restored, now.

258
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,430
Your wounds all are cured, Chopper.

259
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,240
Yes! Thank you, Doctor!

260
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,410
Eh well, goes well.

261
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,770
Now, go away.

262
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,060
Take your life in hand,
I am occupied with my research.

263
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,060
I do not have any more any reason to deal with you, now!

264
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,820
Doctor, I will obstruct you never again!

265
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,660
Let enter to me!

266
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,590
I will mass you the every day!

267
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,510
I will serve your tea to you!

268
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,390
I will clean the laboratory!

269
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,000
Please, let remain to me!

270
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,120
I do not have a friend!
I do not have nowhere where to go!

271
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,740
Doctor!

272
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,220
Doctor!

273
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,050
Doctor!

274
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,620
Doctor!

275
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,100
Chopper!

276
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,830
Look at, Doctor.

277
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,170
I have badly.

278
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,540
Look at, Doctor!

279
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,590
Look at…

280
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,400
Why… Doctor?

281
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,390
Release!

282
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,070
On the sea or elsewhere, I don't care!

283
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,660
Give the feet never again here!

284
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,620
Forgive me, Chopper!

285
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,400
I… will die, hein?

286
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,540
Yes, you will die.

287
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,690
Say to me, it remains to me how much days?

288
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,290
Oya, if you requests a diagnosis, I will not do it.

289
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,300
You do not have money to pay my fees.

290
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,980
Say to me!

291
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,930
As if you could kill somebody with this anesthetic gun.

292
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,070
Well, I you will say it.

293
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,460
There remain to you 10 days, as from now, with 5:00 precise.

294
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,670
Rest in peace.

295
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,570
10 days? It is more than one should not any.

296
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,270
2 days only.
I will have finished in 2 days.

297
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,370
After 30 years of research,

298
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,150
I will make flower the cherry trees of this island!

299
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,240
Cherry trees in flowers?

300
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,980
You want to say that research which you have make during these 30 last years…

301
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,410
… were to make flower cherry trees here?

302
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,490
As this “miracle of the flowered cherry trees” which would have cured you when you were a large robber?

303
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,500
Ouais!

304
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,470
Cretin.

305
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,030
It is a covered with snow island, it freezes all the year.

306
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,110
Never no cherry tree will flower here.

307
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,080
They will flower!

308
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,090
Me the worst of the good-for-nothings, I came very close to death…

309
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,880
I was transformed until deepest of my heart and that gave me the force to live.

310
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,410
That wants to say that any person in this world can be cured!

311
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,130
I want to prove that with my country, Drum!

312
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,050
Stop a little. What you try to do is not medicine, it is completely absurd.

313
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,380
To make flower cherry trees in this country will not awake anything among these people.

314
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,620
Hiluluk?

315
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,300
Chopper, we are similar!

316
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,620
However, I will show you before dying…

317
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,870
… that there is nothing impossible!

318
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,540
One can do everything!

319
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:49,430
But this history did not have a happy end…

320
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,340
I will show you with all!

321
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,690
The miracle of the cherry trees in flowers!

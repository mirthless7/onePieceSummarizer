1
00:00:01,283 --> 00:00:05,600
If you are ready to die, then follow me.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,466
I will lend to you…

3
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:08,866
Umi Ressha!

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,333
Here it is!

5
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,949
It was baptized Rocket Man.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,533
It cannot transport passengers.

7
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:22,949
Rocket Man!

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,733
It with the fast air!

9
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:27,800
Take it.

10
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,682
I prepared it.

11
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:32,800
Water and coal are charged,
the vapor is pressurizing itself.

12
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:36,000
Did Ossan, you prepare it for us?

13
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,866
You will celebrate that only on your return.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,082
This Rocket Man, it does not matter how
it is regulated, his speed remains unverifiable.

15
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,600
It is a missed prototype going back to before Puffing Tom.

16
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,466
I cannot guarantee your safety.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,133
Ah! Thank you, Ice-Ossan!

18
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,266
STRAW HAT!

19
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,882
Please…

20
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:05,200
TAKE US ALONG WITH YOU!

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,549
Franky-Aniki is taken along over there by the government,

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,066
one wants to continue them…

23
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,266
but one cannot pass Aqua Laguna all alone!

24
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,266
Pity!

25
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,466
We want to save Aniki!

26
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:22,266
Go up.

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,600
In speed!

28
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:25,933
Straw hat…

29
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:28,066
AFFLICTED!

30
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,266
You will be revaudra that!

31
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:32,400
Prepare you to leave!

32
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,549
Now, dear pirates…

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,066
Take care not to fall from the train!

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,949
We leave Water Seven, in direction
of Enies Lobby, on board Umi Ressha…

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,933
Rocket Man!

36
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:07,400
Yosh! Departure!

37
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,133
It left!

38
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:16,266
Everyone is brought back!

39
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:24,150
LET US HELP OUR FRIENDS!
MUTUAL OATH ENEMIES!

40
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,099
One can really leave from here?

41
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,083
They are the sewers!

42
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,683
Is Luffy, all well?

43
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,683
Water returned to me in the nose…

44
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,816
What you insane up there too?!

45
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:06,883
Would be careful!

46
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,750
I was well afraid.

47
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,150
But that becomes interesting!

48
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:21,832
Oï-oï! Granny head of shark!

49
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,750
One is going down!

50
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,499
The exit is close.

51
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,883
One directly will be propelled outside!

52
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:58,350
Yosh! Umi Ressha is there!

53
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:01,750
Go the guy! One moves from there!

54
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,216
Jump! Sodome, Gomorrhe!

55
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,216
It is what that?

56
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,550
Straw hat!

57
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,700
All the members of Franky Family are with your service!

58
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,550
Lance-harpoon! Fire!

59
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,283
Brilliant!

60
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:42,283
It is of King bulldozers of higher class!

61
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,083
Too much cool!

62
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,350
Brothel, which load of cretins…

63
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,432
SPECIES OF SHINGLE!!

64
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,883
Count on us!

65
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,150
Which sympathetic nerve skewer of damaged.

66
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:03,283
Is He, Granny Head of Shark, it that maximum speed?

67
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,032
It is not fast finally…

68
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:09,016
Would be patient. You will see when one will be on the rails…

69
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,016
Rails?

70
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,350
I see some nowhere…

71
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,816
They had to derive a little.

72
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:22,032
No problem, I supervised it
Umi Ressha since its whole beginning.

73
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,150
Do not underestimate me!

74
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,283
It left!

75
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,216
Urgent message of the pulpit!

76
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,283
Once we will be on the rails,
our speed will increase considerably.

77
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,150
You stud well,
and you will be only slightly wounded!

78
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,616
Thus one will be wounded no matter what it arrives…

79
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:06,550
Missed Zut……

80
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,016
But… it is not finished yet!

81
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,632
Go! Do what I say to you!

82
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:23,483
Almost, Granny, almost! A little more towards the line!

83
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:26,899
Look at well!

84
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,416
Now I go…

85
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:31,483
Chimney! Gonbe!

86
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:35,350
You followed us?!

87
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,816
Eh yes!

88
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:42,499
What a catastrophe!

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,616
Quickly return to put to you at the shelter!

90
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,683
You will be made carry!

91
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,016
All is well granny!

92
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,016
Chimney!

93
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,832
I will fall!

94
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,165
Hold good!

95
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,083
I will fly away!

96
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,632
Have-await a little!

97
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,350
I stop all!

98
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,432
I had forgotten!

99
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:17,683
There are no brakes on that one it is true!

100
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,883
What? Oh that with the funny air!

101
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,283
It is Nii-chan with the Straw hat! Oooï!

102
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,899
Straw hat, brings back them quickly inside!

103
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,483
You will be projected in the air if the train enraille!

104
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,150
Of agreement!

105
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,232
Yatta! They were put on the rails!

106
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:17,016
Really? It is my turn. Let me see!

107
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:23,616
It is true… I-see-I-see-I-see…

108
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,632
One did not expect from it less Kokoro-san.

109
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,416
It is completely incredible.

110
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,416
Indeed. During one moment,
I was not badly anxious nevertheless.

111
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,899
Indeed, indeed! It is right!

112
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,899
That must be difficult enrailler
with similar waves.

113
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,432
I am of agreement!

114
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,016
Indeed, indeed… It is right.

115
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:44,416
Indeed, indeed, indeed…

116
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:48,350
Oui-oui-oui-oui… It was well played indeed…

117
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,950
Played well, indeed… yes…

118
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,283
In effect!

119
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,216
We should inform Iceberg-san of it…

120
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,699
Yes, it is right…

121
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,416
It must worry about their fate.

122
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:09,483
Oui-oui-oui, it is that, yes…

123
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,299
Jan!

124
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,350
Ken!

125
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:53,300
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

126
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:08,232
Worry you, I am sure that it is well.

127
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:12,883
Even when it was made press
by Umi Ressha, it knew to be raised.

128
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:19,750
You heard ace?

129
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,299
It appears that the violent one apprentice of Tom,

130
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,217
Cutty Flam, died.

131
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,617
It was made reverse by Umi Ressha.

132
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,150
Iceberg.

133
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,550
You can arrive there

134
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:40,550
You are the first disciple of Tom,
the largest naval engineer in the world.

135
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,683
You can arrive there.

136
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,550
You… can…

137
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:48,450
Kokoro-san, one will drink glass one day.

138
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,650
It will be pleasant.

139
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,000
Tom-san…

140
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,650
Look at me.

141
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,750
I will perpetuate your dream.

142
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,150
I will protect it.

143
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,050
Entire.

144
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,950
This city…

145
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,950
And these plan!

146
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,700
- 4 years with paravant -

147
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,083
Iceberg-san, you have a visitor.

148
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,683
He is called Cutty Flam, and claims to know you.

149
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,783
Do I have to let it enter?

150
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,083
Not.

151
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,950
Renew the outside.

152
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,683
You ace a strange way of accommodating people.

153
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,950
Nmaa… And you, what arrived at your body?

154
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,432
Your mouth!

155
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:49,633
My body useless, I due was thus modified
with ends of scrap to survive!

156
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,232
And one of fout of that!

157
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:54,817
Apparently, you ace agreed to build
ships for the government!

158
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,232
I will never forgive myself to have helped the government!

159
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,750
They took Tom-san and…

160
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,017
The weapons which started all that…

161
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,817
Who built them?!

162
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,950
You do not have any right to reproach me anything!

163
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,017
Will not imagine you that I forgave you after 4 years!

164
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:20,417
How oses you to return here after what occurred?!

165
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:21,817
What?!

166
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:25,150
I thought that you had died.

167
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:27,617
It is what the government said to us.

168
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,950
Even if Tom-san forgave you…

169
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,017
I do not intend to do as much of it.

170
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,432
O… Oï! It is what that?!

171
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:46,617
It is the plan of the old weapon which it had shown us?!

172
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,517
From now on, you should not be made any more call “Cutty Flam”.

173
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,567
The government was not
able to take it in Tom-san.

174
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,350
It is only one matter of time
before it is caught some with me.

175
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:59,217
Take it and leaves this island, Franky.

176
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,483
To leave the island?

177
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,783
Cutty Flam of Tom' S Workers died.

178
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,683
If you exchanges of name, it will not have there
more bond between you and me.

179
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,632
Moreover, if you free the island,
any trace of the plan will disappear.

180
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:17,299
Wait one minute! What will it occur if they come to find you, and that you do not have the plans?

181
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,550
It is all that I had to say.

182
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,483
Oï! Iceberg!

183
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,899
One will not undoubtedly be re-examined more.

184
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,683
Oï! Wait!

185
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,350
Do you want to know the same fate as Tom-san?

186
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,099
Take the plan.

187
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,617
Keep it and if that becomes too dangerous,
you will have to only give them!

188
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,950
Or if you ace not desire for keeping it, burns it.

189
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,150
If you had to choose, that would you make?

190
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,350
Tom-san was a hero.

191
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,483
He sacrificed his own life to protect this plan.

192
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:52,417
As long as there will be a risk to see
Nico Robin to awake the old weapon…

193
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,217
one will need them like forces countermeasure.

194
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:03,150
Even if I keep them with me, I would prefer
to die to give it to the government!

195
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,283
Be sure for you of you?

196
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,899
I could build this trick if I wanted.

197
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,150
You ace really confidence in me?

198
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,617
The fact that I entrusted them to you
doesn't he answer your question?

199
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,217
One will never change, not truth?

200
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,683
One engueule always when one sees oneself.

201
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,283
And I will never forgive myself, even after that.

202
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,617
And you will probably never forgive me but…

203
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,150
Franky…

204
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:27,750
Dumb…

205
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,017
I am…

206
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,950
really content that you would be alive!

207
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,232
Wait, Bakaberg!

208
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,683
I will not leave this island!

209
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,432
I will make as I hear it!

210
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:53,499
I will never take your advice,
even if I must die about it!

211
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,083
Never!

212
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,550
Species of Bakanky!

213
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,232
Dumb, why you do not want to include/understand?!

214
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:04,166
It is to protect the plan!

215
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,766
Your mouth! Be the only one to you not to include/understand!

216
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,817
I will not leave, not bars!

217
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:14,550
Why I think of him in one similar moment?

218
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,032
And this cretin…

219
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:18,950
Is iceberg in life?

220
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,417
We killed it.

221
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,950
I believed that I was going to die…

222
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,366
Obviously that you will die!

223
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:46,750
I had said you well that you would be made carry.

224
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,017
It was an acceleration of nutcase!

225
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,632
I really was afraid.

226
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,750
I was done badly with the back…

227
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,483
Wait one minute.

228
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,017
There is several guy suspects here.

229
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,632
What? Who that?

230
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,832
They IS YOU WHOM ONE SPEAKS!

231
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,483
AND OF YOU TOO!

232
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,150
I decided to come with you.

233
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:17,017
One did not can stop you in spite of
all the evil which one gave oneself.

234
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:20,483
The types which hold your
friend who is so expensive to you…

235
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:24,750
are also those which tried to assassinate Iceberg-san.

236
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:28,483
I have many things to say to these people!

237
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,232
PAULEE! ONE WILL NOT LEAVE YOU
NOT TO AMUSE You ALL ALONE!

238
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:36,499
ONE THOUGHT OF FINDING THE ATTACKERS
ICEBERG-SAN IF YOU WERE FOLLOWED…

239
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,966
THEN ONE IS CUSHY JOBS
IN THE COACH COAL HAS!

240
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,683
And here… it is like that.

241
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,083
We saw just.
We will also join the combat.

242
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:50,099
And of course, our enemies have
also removed Franky-Aniki.

243
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,099
It is true! And one knows even exactly who they are!

244
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,032
He, galériens! If it arrives some
thing in our Aniki, you will pay it to us!

245
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:01,217
Silence! That which suffers more is Iceberg-san!

246
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,899
BUT ABOUT WHAT YOU SPEAK AT THE END?!

247
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,699
PAULEE!

248
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,099
EXPLAIN us! THAT IS PASSES

249
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,350
Do Ouais, Paulee, you know guilty truths, not truth?

250
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,483
One wants to hear it your own mouth.

251
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,699
One is not if idiots.

252
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,617
There were already suspicions…

253
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,083
One will not be surprised.

254
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:25,299
Well, you had surely included/understood it
when they disappeared from a blow without reason.

255
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,683
Then, I will say it frankly to you.

256
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,966
These types with the masks were…

257
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:35,750
Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa and Blueno the barman.

258
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:40,483
They tried to kill Iceberg-san.

259
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,432
It IS NOW THAT YOU STRIKE?!!

260
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,832
But you had said that they had returned on their premises!

261
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,366
HOW If THEY HAD THAT has FOUTRE!!

262
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:51,299
It was thought that it was Michael and Hoikel of the low city.

263
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,032
OUAIS OUAIS.

264
00:19:52,033 --> 00:19:53,032
BUT It IS WHICH THESE?!

265
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:55,699
Q-what?! You do not know them?!

266
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,299
They are really famous in the low city.

267
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,166
OUAIS OUAIS.

268
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,832
AND HOW I COULD THE KNOWLEDGE?!

269
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,032
Yosh! I fix

270
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,217
Lastly, my stomach is full…

271
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:09,283
Well, then…

272
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:13,417
With Franky Family and the engineers of Galley it…

273
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,699
there were not badly problems downtown.

274
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,483
But from now on, we have common enemies.

275
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:23,483
Most extremely of them,
it is without any doubt the guy with the pigeon!

276
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,950
And it is me which will massacre it!

277
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:31,550
It is true. It is a combat to recover
four people that they removed us.

278
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,883
One will not stop so much
that they will not have been caught up with.

279
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,483
Granny! Granny! It is Aqua Laguna!

280
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,366
Oh? It is already there.

281
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,950
Chimney, lets see me!

282
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:54,566
They is bad! Kokoro-san, would not owe you
not to be in the pulpit?

283
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,617
One must absolutely pass this giant wave!

284
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,166
I already said it to you, Rocket Man is unverifiable.

285
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:05,017
My job was right to put the train on the rails.

286
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:08,617
Neither the direction nor the brakes function.

287
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,499
It is for that this train always runs at bottom.

288
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,832
Nobody any more can stop it now.

289
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:15,832
I do not believe in it…

290
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,966
Luffy! If that continues, the train
will crash to pieces itself against these waves…

291
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:20,617
He, Luffy!

292
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,217
Now that we all go the same direction…

293
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,883
there is no reason but one fights separately.

294
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,550
Well…

295
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,883
Listen, we are allied!

296
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,283
In Umi Ressha left in front of,
there is already a member of my crew!

297
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,817
Our force will be larger still!

298
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,950
The guy!

299
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,683
One will not let a large wave stop us!

300
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,150
One all will achieve our goal!

301
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,350
It LEFT!!

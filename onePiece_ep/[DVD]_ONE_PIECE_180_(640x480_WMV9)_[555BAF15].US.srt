1
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,140
I had predicted that it there
would have that 5 survivors.

2
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,890
Then now, which will disappear?

3
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,910
You will disappear.

4
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,579
That of insolence.

5
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:34,060
Fights in the Old Ruins!
The Desire of Eneru God!!

6
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,249
He, this house…

7
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,110
The pretty girl who lives there
exploit of the toothing-stone the beach.

8
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,929
Yes, I know it.

9
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,530
It is here that live Pagaya-san
and his/her Conis-san daughter.

10
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,500
They are very nice people.

11
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,079
I ate on their premises some times.

12
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,500
But it appears, that in fact,
she is very malicious.

13
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,910
And his/her father too.

14
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,029
It is what one said to me too.

15
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,080
It helped the malicious ones of
blue Sea to escape.

16
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,539
Impossible!

17
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,909
It is the truth!

18
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,289
These malicious people have
clerk of the sacrileges towards God!

19
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,730
It is my father who said it to me!

20
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,569
Your father?

21
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,870
Of agreement…

22
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,160
Ah yes, your father…

23
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,460
Yes, my father is in the army of God.

24
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,389
He continues to serve God.

25
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,680
Mom always says that it goes
soon to return to the house,

26
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,249
But I never saw his face…

27
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,239
Ouais, but to serve God,

28
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,440
your father must be brilliant!

29
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,560
You believe?

30
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,309
Of course!

31
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,429
I hope that you will meet
soon your father.

32
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,740
Yes!

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,499
Skypiea will be returned
in the Blue Sea!

34
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,930
All the country will disappear!

35
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,379
I will achieve his last wills!

36
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,429
I must…

37
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,410
I must inform them!

38
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,410
You want to make me disappear?

39
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,640
It is rather funny.

40
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,249
Problem!

41
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,190
This guy poses problem to us!

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,199
I see how you
survived the play.

43
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,930
But, you four…

44
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,710
do not seem to have included/understood
to which you address itself.

45
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,120
You still did not include/understand it
what represents the existence of God.

46
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,470
A poor decrepit old man who
aspire to the prosperity of Skypiea…

47
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,880
A warrior who with the intention
to recover its terre natale…

48
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,230
And two robbers of the Blue Sea
who run after a gold handle.

49
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,789
This world is full with problems.

50
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,180
You them lambs, you are free
to wish all that you like.

51
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,860
This country always was in the error.

52
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,870
Instead of telling nonsenses,
say to me rather where my Soldiers are!

53
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,230
What do you wish so much?

54
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,769
The Rise, Gan Fall.

55
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,409
The Rise?

56
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,609
Yes.

57
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,639
If God rises,

58
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,480
He turns over to his legitimate place.

59
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,229
Turns over?

60
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,710
Want you to say that you
accounts to leave Skypiea?

61
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,150
Yes, I have a place which awaits me.

62
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,490
On the celestial island where I am
born, God really exists.

63
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,320
Where that?

64
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,880
People call it Fairy Vearth.

65
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,880
[Note:Fairy-like Vearth]

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,520
Over there, one can admire there
an infinite ground!

67
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,020
Here is the World of
Dreams to which I aspire!

68
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,310
A country which is appropriate to me
perfectly:Fairy Vearth!

69
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,580
Upper Yard is only one vulgar piece
of Vearth which does not deserve to be disputed.

70
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,530
It does not even deserve
that I am delayed there.

71
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,540
Will know that the cause of your combat is
much deeper than you think it.

72
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,530
Reflect there.

73
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,709
It is not a cloud,
but it was born in the sky.

74
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,440
It is not a bird,
but he lives in the sky.

75
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,209
Extending through the sky,
this territory itself…

76
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,109
hiding place an abnormal existence.

77
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,139
Ground, people,

78
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,460
And even God in person, have
their own legitimate place.

79
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,480
You want to say that…

80
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,219
If be not astonished.

81
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,680
As a God, laws of
nature undergo my jurisdiction.

82
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,980
So I must apply them.

83
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,860
Yes, I will dispatch out of the sky
any man, woman and child!

84
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,590
Species of demon. You
accounts to destroy this country?

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,020
It is nature.

86
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,079
You over-estimate yourself too much, Eneru!

87
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,560
“God” is simply the title
given the governor of this country!

88
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,700
Yes, until now.

89
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,190
God never saw
in the world of the human ones!

90
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,510
Former God, Gan Fall.

91
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,840
You have concern for
your Soldiers, I believe.

92
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,830
Six years ago, overcome by my troops, 650 of your Soldiers passed under my orders.

93
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,770
This morning even, they finished
try that I had imposed to them…

94
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,440
on this island.

95
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,850
And as I said, only still
debouts on this island, is us six.

96
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,789
I had to do one
rather unpleasant thing.

97
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,030
You…

98
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,010
It is not that I wanted of it.

99
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,420
When I have to them
announced my intentions…

100
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,050
They became insane of
rage and they attacked me!

101
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,099
They have a whole a family
on Angel Island!

102
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,429
Indeed.

103
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,610
I would have also soon
to have their families.

104
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,520
Species of monster!

105
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,670
DEMON!

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,309
5.000.000

107
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,739
10.000.000

108
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,240
20.000.000

109
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,620
The fault…

110
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,740
The fault returns to us.

111
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,289
The Shandia warriors…

112
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,670
only attacked
the island of God, Upper Yard…

113
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,720
in order to recover
ground of their ancestors.

114
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,969
God, why make such remarks?

115
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,249
Look at around.

116
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,550
Look at the blessed existence of Skypiea.

117
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,940
Our ancestors made this possible
by taking this ground 400 years ago.

118
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,240
It of our responsibility is
to put an end to this war…

119
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,180
and to protect them
benefits of this country?

120
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,019
You made your better
in the control of the negotiations.

121
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,490
It is not worthwhile to have still pity of these people who want nothing to hear!

122
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,080
400 years…

123
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,479
That it is our
fault or theirs…

124
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,080
Can be that the time of
to recognize the defeat…

125
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,780
is completed for a long time.

126
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,729
We are attacked!

127
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,990
We are attacked!

128
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,819
It is an attack of Shandia?

129
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,269
They are not Shandia.

130
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,600
What do you say?

131
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,860
It is made call Eneru God.

132
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,060
Eneru God?

133
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,920
Who would dare to be made pass
for God in this lieu saint?

134
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,169
What is it?

135
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,689
You speak about your Soldiers?

136
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,370
They were not too
forts that you believed it.

137
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,129
Who are you?

138
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,110
But, I must recognize that them
honesty towards God was admirable.

139
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,819
Eneru?

140
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,779
I suppose that you are God,

141
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,960
Or should I rather say, former God.

142
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,760
Species of monster!

143
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,840
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

144
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,350
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

145
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,790
Eneru-sama.

146
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,319
What hope you to make
this former poor God?

147
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,099
Balance it with the sea.

148
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,540
He would not be good with
nothing with the forced labor.

149
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,079
It I like this sanctuary well,

150
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,190
But I need a holy army.

151
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,529
We will send them to the forced labor,

152
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,719
And I will be their chief.

153
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,580
They are my men.

154
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,229
Silence!

155
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,040
You are not any more God.

156
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,140
20.000.000 VOLT

157

158
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,339
Odd knight!

159
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,700
Old man!

160
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,790
There is one God in this world.

161
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,830
And it is Me.

162
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,680
A Fruit of the Demon?!

163
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,700
[Note:Goro Goro = thunder]

164
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,819
Of all the capacities,

165
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,230
this one is known
to be invincible.

166
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,650
Power of the lightning!

167
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,169
The lightning?

168
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,469
Not…

169
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,770
No human can face that!

170
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,830
And now, my period
of prediction is past.

171
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,030
There is henceforth…

172
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,059
5 survivors!

173
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,510
I congratulate you to have survived!

174
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,739
Now, you will accompany me…

175
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,540
in my voyage towards
the World of the Dreams!

176
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,940
Towards Fairy Vearth!

177
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,030
You all will join me!

178
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,869
What?

179
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,190
I will make of him the Territory
impenetrable of God!

180
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,510
Only the elected officials here present will be able
to live on this promised land!

181
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,340
About what he does speak?

182
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,770
Since my men did not hold during
few hours of the play of Survival…

183
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,190
their presence would not have made
that to pollute this ground.

184
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,229
And…

185
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,300
And if we refuse?

186
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,809
Robin!

187
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,150
To refuse?

188
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,060
Why? I decided it thus.

189
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,530
If you remain here, you will sink
in the abyssals zone with this country.

190
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,280
Indeed, your capacities
you allow it,

191
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,999
But if you destroy it
country without valid reason,

192
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,060
The object that you
sought will sink too.

193
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,640
The Gold Bell?

194
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,060
Yes.

195
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,790
The Gold Bell?

196
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,530
The Gold Bell.

197
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,699
You do not have with you to make some!

198
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,070
I already very planned for that.

199
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,139
While reflecting,
according to your displacements,

200
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,910
there is one
place where it can be.

201
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,390
I think that it is with
the place that you have deduce.

202
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,820
You did not expect it.

203
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:08,680
Believed you to be able me
to double with this sweet talk?

204
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,690
You miss perspicacity.

205
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,940
Robin!

206
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,550
I hate the women manipulators.

207
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,130
Not…

208
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,740
It is a woman!

209
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,940
I confirm.

210
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,060
You are talented.

211
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,830
Be to you nut?!

212
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,460
Burn Bazooka

213
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,210
[Note:god of the wind
(Scandinavian mythology)]

214
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,039
Im… Impossible!

215
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,320
It extinguished the fire of the bazooka!

216
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,419
Thus you still did not include/understand!

217
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,590
All the power which you can
to join together is negligible for me.

218
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,449
If it has creates a clap of thunder,

219
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,439
it had to heat the air for
to explode at the speed of sound.

220
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,980
Is it so powerful?

221
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,929
The difference of
power is too large!

222
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,290
It is really the lightning.

223
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,249
Let us go, go.

224
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,350
We were on the point of
to leave together towards Fairy Vearth.

225
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,510
Pas la pains to become if violent.

226
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,430
And which believe you
to be able to take along over there?

227
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,990
I have anything with foutre of it
of your World of the Dreams!

228
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,939
Zoro!

229
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,899
Not, Zoro!

230
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,410
It is too powerful!

231
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,690
It would seem that only tone body
can render comprehensible you…

232
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,090
significance of God.

233
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,839
Pas la pains to discuss you,

234
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,080
you cannot anything vis-a-vis
my insurmountable capacity!

235
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,760
You now will include/understand…

236
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,070
despair.

237
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,419
See each piece
hope to fly in glare…

238
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,490
it is like dying!

239
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,530
Zoro!

240
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,260
Nothing makes any more fear
with human that death!

241
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,530
This is why they stick their face
on the ground to beseech the kindness of God.

242
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,389
They are impotent.

243
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,970
It is in the nature of any creature
alive of prosterner in front of the fear.

244
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,539
Pitiful.

245
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,439
It is your instinct.

246
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,089
Who is this guy?

247
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,120
He is really strong.

248
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,440
What do you make?

249
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,580
Es you come to make you kill?

250
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,269
What?

251
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,710
You already intended to speak
of Kairouseki, Eneru?

252
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,199
Kairouseki?

253
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,550
The stone which inhibits the capacities of
those having eaten a Fruit of the Demon.

254
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,339
I see.

255
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,560
My capacity is aspired.

256
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,379
Kairouseki…

257
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,050
The stone which emits an energy
similar to that of the sea.

258
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,089
It is the solidified sea water shape.

259
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,560
Therefore it weakens
those having eaten a Fruit of the Demon!

260
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,889
Now, join death!

261
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,769
Stop.

262
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,070
I know. You have Reject.

263
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,169
Considering your state, you will die too.

264
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,579
What do you still wish?

265
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,389
You Vearth, isn't this wanted?

266
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,129
Close it.

267
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,440
Death is all that I wish…

268
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,800
if I can carry you with me!

269
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,820
With… Stops!

270
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,620
Reject

271
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,920
You heard?

272
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,270

It has…

273
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,620
overcome?

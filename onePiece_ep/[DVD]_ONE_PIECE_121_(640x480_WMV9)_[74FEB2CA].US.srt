1
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:41,010
The Voice of Vivi is lost!

2
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:41,010
A hero with ground!

3
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,320
Who are you?

4
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,650
The Tsumegeri guards.

5
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,320
These contusions!

6
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,760
They drank the water which destroys the life!

7
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,150
They drank prohibited water!

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,340
They have nothing any more but a few minutes to live!

9
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,000
If you decided to die,

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,440
I, isn't this does not even need to fight you?

11
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,400
Inhuman…

12
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,150
I cannot think of a better example of stupidity.

13
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,570
Thus you also…

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,430
… you want to die…

15
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,920
… for the others?

16
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,270
Wait!

17
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,370
Kohza-San…

18
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,170
The battle is finished!

19
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,150
Calm your anger and deposit your weapons!

20
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,430
The royal army does not wish to fight longer!

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,310
Really, Kohza-San?

22
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,730
Yes!

23
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,930
The war is…

24
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,830
KOHZA!!!

25
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,940
Kohza!!!

26
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,710
An astonishing city will be built…

27
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,240
… one will make this country richer!

28
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,610
Certainly…

29
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,320
Tit do not fight…

30
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,760
… army rebels!

31
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,650
Kohza!

32
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,450
Kohza-San!

33
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,800
My God!

34
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,900
Kohza!

35
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,410
THEY HAVE CAR ON KOHZA-SAN!

36
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,590
KILL them!

37
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,070
OUAIS!

38
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,140
Works baroque!

39
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,430
Dumb!

40
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,040
Why you drawn ace on Kohza!?

41
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,220
Army rebels…

42
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,450
Listen…

43
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,700
What?

44
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,280
Sand starts to blow!

45
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,760
Army rebels!

46
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,930
They draw us above!

47
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,530
These cowards!!!

48
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,760
From which does this swirl of sand come!?

49
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,320
I see more anything!

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,710
Bandage cowards!

51
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,420
Stop drawing with the aveuglette!

52
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,590
But what occurs, brothel?

53
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,930
Nothing of such as panic.

54
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,070
Us, Works Baroque, naps infiltrated on the two sides.

55
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,430
Not!

56
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,460
Hey! Hold good.

57
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,080
You invite that “to return the weapons”?

58
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,170
They raised the drapeau blanc to tighten us a trap!

59
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,680
Then it is as that which the royal army fights?

60
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,250
Bandage dirty cowards!

61
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,910
I beg you!

62
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,550
You stop all!

63
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,320
Do not fight!

64
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,050
Listen to me!

65
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,430
Have-stop…

66
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,850
Army rebels…!

67
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,380
This battle is…

68
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,440
Will Ca go?

69
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,950
Answer the shootings, royal army!

70
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,340
Stop!

71
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,130
Stop, please…

72
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,940
Please…

73
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,090
Stop…

74
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,890
Stop…

75
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,680
You fought well, my expensive…

76
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,590
But…

77
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,690
Your voice will not reach anybody.

78
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,030
Then it is thus that?

79
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,170
Course, Vivi!

80
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,420
Flee this monster!

81
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,140
Not!

82
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,100
You created this plugging sand cloud.

83
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,550
But…

84
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,430
But if I can prevent this bomb from exploding in 15 minutes,

85
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,090
I can still save some lives!

86
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,850
“If I make Ci, I will stop the rebellion.”

87
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,650
“If I do that, I will stop the rebellion.”

88
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,590
Open the eyes, Princesse.

89
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,580
Your puffing idealism disgusts me.

90
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,650
Those which can speak about ideals, they are those enough powerful to reach them.

91
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,320
And of done you not part!

92
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,980
I of insane, if that disgusts you!

93
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,130
I will not give up my ideal!

94
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,950
You will be able to never include/understand!

95
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,580
I am the Princess of this country!

96
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,060
I will never lower the arms!

97
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,120
You lack charm.

98
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,630
I will never give up!

99
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,460
I…

100
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,900
I…

101
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,100
… will save this country.

102
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,790
Vivi!

103
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,590
More than 15 minutes before the bomb explodes.

104
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,250
The reinforcements of the army rebels still gather per hour when one speaks.

105
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,900
And, just as your cruel destiny, they go right in the middle of the disaster.

106
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,740
If you had been able to inform the soldiers for the bomb,

107
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,140
even in a general panic, you could have saved of them thousands, even tens of thousands.

108
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,210
Made not that!

109
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,830
Please, not…!

110
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,240
Crocodile!

111
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,850
Your desperate attempts to save everyone failed!

112
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,770
Consequently from what your loved people will be destroyed!

113
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,470
Beginning with the end,

114
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,800
you did everything me to laugh!

115
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,350
All, as far as you are, in this country!

116
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,850
You have spy my organization during 2 years.

117
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,380
Good job!

118
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,980
It is me! You do not recognize me?

119
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,930
It is comprehensible…

120
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,020
I lost a little weight.

121
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,070
But, at the end, you did not stop anything.

122
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,910
“I will stop the rebellion.”

123
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,730
“I will save the kingdom.”

124
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,450
All that your stupid idealism did…

125
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,610
it is to increase the number of victims!

126
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,950
I say it once again to you:

127
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,130
you cannot save this country.

128
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,450
Good voyage, Princess.

129
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,620
Impossible…

130
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,020
Crocodile!

131
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,180
Luffy-San…

132
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,770
Straw hat!?

133
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,410
One succeeded!

134
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,340
Luffy-San!

135
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,410
Pell!

136
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,900
It remains little of time before a bomb explodes on the place…

137
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,480
Everyone will die!

138
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,190
Nobody hears me…

139
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,720
If that continues, this country goes…

140
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,620
Do not worry you!

141
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,920
You very well are heard.

142
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,130
I say to you… that my wounds are quite worse!

143
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,190
Oh keep silent yourself. Be to you a man, then stops feeling sorry for you!

144
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,530
My leg is wounded.
I cannot hold upright!

145
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,570
Oh, I will disappear…

146
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,600
Liar!!!

147
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,180
Made attention with you, Luffy-Kun.

148
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,540
I ate tons of meat.

149
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,010
I feel full with energy!

150
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,420
I…

151
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,770
… will not lose once again.

152
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,750
How it could survive moving sands with its wounds…

153
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,830
LUFFY ALIVE EAST!!!

154
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,990
Tony-Kun!

155
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,550
Qu qu Quoiiii?

156
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,760
Luffy!?

157
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,550
Vivi is there too!!

158
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,880
You see!? I had said to you that it would be left there!

159
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,580
I never doubted him!

160
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,690
I see!

161
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,400
One would not have believed, considering your head.

162
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,190
Usopp-San, Sanji-San!

163
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,880
What did it occur, Vivi-Chan?

164
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,790
You are wounded?

165
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,400
Usopp!

166
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,870
Nami-San, Mr. Bushido…

167
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,400
You all are in life!!

168
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,430
Who asked you to manufacture a toy to make turns of magic??

169
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,080
I KNEW THAT YOU COULD HOLD UPRIGHT, BROTHEL!

170
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,500
NAMI-SWAN!

171
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,380
M- but, there are techniques of combat, also…

172
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,050
One will speak again about it when all that is finished!

173
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,440
Vivi?

174
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,080
What occurs here?

175
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,280
Why sand whirls everywhere?

176
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,220
, Salts you bastard!

177
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,520
How did you can let Nami-San be wounded?

178
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,400
I will kill you!

179
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,900
It is well!

180
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,700
Chopper, grants to me a favor.

181
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,140
Bury my dead-man in the wild, vast and untamed extents.

182
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,620
Its wounds mortals were suddenly fatal to him!

183
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,550
Afflicted, you all.

184
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,180
I… lost against him.

185
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,730
This is why…

186
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,720
This is why…

187
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,340
I will not reperdrai!

188
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,430
You undertake the remainder!

189
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,050
Go, releases from there.

190
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,800
If you cannot beat it…

191
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,630
THEN WHICH WILL BE ABLE IT, CRETIN?

192
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,090
I will finish some with that.

193
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,010
All this history!

194
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,280
OUAIS!

195
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,730
You all…

196
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,780
I still have friends here…

197
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,330
DUMB!!!

198
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,370
It does not matter the number of engagements,
you will be never able to reach me!

199
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,840
Or perhaps do you still want to finish impaled?

200
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,290
Who is this!?

201
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,210
It…!?

202
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,730
Marunoko = Circular saw

203
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,570
It struck Crocodile!

204
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,630
Upright!

205
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,960
It is the water of Yuba, widespread on your hand, which showed me…

206
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,130
… that you cannot change into sand when are wet to you.

207
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,630
You ace fear of water.

208
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,910
It is for that you stolen ace the rain.

209
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,280
Now I will burst you the head.

210
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,990
Thus let us start.

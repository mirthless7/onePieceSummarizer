1
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,188
Sanji-san, leave this ship, please.

2
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:58,357
I don't want to kill you.

3
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,026
I'm not leaving.

4
00:02:00,427 --> 00:02:01,427
PEARL...

5
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,728
CROSS!

6
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:09,410
I'm the one who stole everything from that old man.

7
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:09,702
I'm the one who stole everything from that old man.

8
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:13,205
I'm the one who stole everything from that old man.

9
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:13,289
I'm the one who stole everything from that old man.

10
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,041
So that I could live...

11
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,427
His power...

12
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:20,728
His dreams...

13
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:35,185
This restaurant is the old mans treasure.

14
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:37,186
If I...

15
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:42,234
If I don't place my life on the line as well,
I won't be able to repay the old fart!

16
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,293
If I don't place my life on the line as well,
I won't be able to repay the old fart!

17
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:44,778
GOMU GOMU NO...

18
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:45,195
GOMU GOMU NO...

19
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:46,530
GOMU GOMU NO...

20
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:46,572
GOMU GOMU NO...

21
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,699
Stop it! Don't interfere!

22
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:48,949
Stop it! Don't interfere!

23
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,492
AXE!!!

24
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:06,466
The Coldhearted Devil-man.
Gin, The Pirate Fleet Battle Commander

25
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:06,508
The Coldhearted Devil-man.
Gin, The Pirate Fleet Battle Commander

26
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,832
The Fin...

27
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,068
The Fin is destroyed!?

28
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,533
That guy...

29
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,452
Is he planning to destroy the ship?

30
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:35,829
Is he planning to destroy the ship?

31
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:36,997
Gin!

32
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:39,499
Blow his head off!

33
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,878
Hurry up!

34
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:44,254
B... But...

35
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:48,383
He's the one who gave us enough to feed our men!

36
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,345
Gin, you bastard.

37
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,887
Hey.

38
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:56,474
I wasn't fighting back at you.

39
00:03:58,184 --> 00:03:59,269
I only destroyed the Fin.

40
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:02,689
You bastard waiter boy!

41
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:03,982
What are you trying to do?!

42
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:04,983
Sink it.

43
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:05,942
WHAT!

44
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:08,862
I'm going to sink the ship.

45
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:14,659
Are you joking?!

46
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:17,587
Bastard! I thought you were
gonna say something else!

47
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,038
Are you for real, you shit!?

48
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,292
But if I destroy the ship, they
can't get what they want.

49
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:27,213
And what do you know about this!?

50
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:31,467
What do you know about the immensity
of my debt to this place?!

51
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:34,262
So you're going to die for it?

52
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:35,680
Are you stupid?

53
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,140
What did you say?

54
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:38,683
It's not about death!

55
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,686
Dying isn't paying him back!

56
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,522
That's not what he put his life on the line for!

57
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,917
He saved you so that you could
live, yet you want to die!?

58
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:50,936
Only a weak person would act like that!

59
00:04:51,154 --> 00:04:53,781
Then what the hell do you suggest!?

60
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:02,540
Oh, both of you.

61
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:03,916
Stop arguing.

62
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,511
Fighting amongst yourselves at a moment
like this is just laughable.

63
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:12,433
But you can't do anything regardless now
that we have a hostage in our hands.

64
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,546
How unfortunate for you that to have
to face us, the Don Krieg Pirates.

65
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:23,802
Now let my Fire Pearls,

66
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:26,272
Burn you down!

67
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,289
Gin!

68
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,708
Why? Gin...

69
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,877
Sorry, Pearl.

70
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:50,704
Just stand aside.

71
00:05:55,884 --> 00:05:56,552
Gin.

72
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,512
You're betraying me?

73
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:00,973
Forgive me, Don Krieg.

74
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:04,935
This person saved us.

75
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,980
I don't want him to die like this.

76
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,481
At least...

77
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,316
At least...

78
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:15,654
Let me finish him with my own hands.

79
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:21,868
Have you lost your mind?

80
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:25,998
My pirate fleet 'Battle commanding officer'?

81
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:28,542
Owner, are you ok?

82
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,502
Owner, get a grip of yourself!

83
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:33,338
Battle commanding officer...

84
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,842
So he's not a regular crewman.

85
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:39,302
He broke the shield of the Iron Wall Man.

86
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:41,054
What a frightening power!

87
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:47,978
Look! Did you see how successful my
'decoy strategy of threat' was?

88
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:48,853
Stop lying!

89
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,439
Do you really want to destroy the ship?

90
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,233
Sanji-san!

91
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:57,787
I wanted you to get off this ship so
that I wouldn't have to hurt you.

92
00:06:57,787 --> 00:07:00,281
But it doesn't look like that's gonna happen.

93
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:00,699
Yeah.

94
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:01,908
I won't go.

95
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,451
This restaurant,

96
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:07,180
I won't give it to you even if it costs my life.

97
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,125
Then at least, let me kill you with my own hands.

98
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:10,500
Then at least, let me kill you with my own hands.

99
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,251
Then at least, let me kill you with my own hands.

100
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,177
I can't make this right or wrong.

101
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:15,547
Thanks.

102
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:17,132
Eat shit.

103
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,843
The same for you, Straw-hat guy.

104
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:20,593
Not necessary.

105
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:24,097
Because I won't lose to a bunch
of weaklings like you.

106
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:28,643
You bastard!

107
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:31,312
How you dare talk to our commander like that?!

108
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,524
Calling him weak to his face!

109
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:38,820
We are the Don Krieg Pirates!
The strongest in East Blue!

110
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,157
Don't you mean, the one with the most people?

111
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:52,875
Looks like you hit 'em where it hurts.

112
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,668
...Definitely.

113
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:57,380
We'll kill these guys ourselves!!

114
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,298
Back off!

115
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:00,716
Don Krieg!

116
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,051
But...

117
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,472
When a guy gets flustered because
someone calls him weak,

118
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:08,966
It's proof that he recognizes he IS weak.

119
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,153
Let the outcome determine the weak and the strong.

120
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:14,605
I'm still here.

121
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,400
So don't make a fuss.

122
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:19,402
Aye!

123
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:20,528
Gin.

124
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:24,698
You're responsible for killing that cook.

125
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,576
That insolent Hammerboy,

126
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:29,745
Leave him to me.

127
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,499
I understand, Don Krieg.

128
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,670
Hey, kid!

129
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:41,215
I'll show you the power that conquered East Blue.

130
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,507
I'll show you the power that conquered East Blue.

131
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,467
I'll show you the power that conquered East Blue.

132
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:49,098
I don't care if you've eaten a devil fruit.

133
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,726
You will come to understand
such a thing is meaningless.

134
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:57,231
You never shut up.

135
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,402
I want to kick your ass. That's it.

136
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,780
Shall we start now?

137
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,573
You just wait right there for me.

138
00:09:08,158 --> 00:09:09,326
You arrogant...

139
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,924
That guy can't tell strong from weak.

140
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:27,010
This time that cook will be finished!

141
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:29,262
If Gin takes out that weapon... he's serious!

142
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:40,232
They call him the Devil-man.

143
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:45,570
No matter how his opponent pleaded for mercy,
he would always kill him without any hesitation.

144
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:49,324
A Devil-man. A human with no feelings.

145
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:55,288
I'm sorry, Sanji-san

146
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:57,791
You can't defeat me.

147
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,961
We'll see, small fry.

148
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:07,592
Take this.

149
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:31,991
Sanji!

150
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,540
Didn't I tell you?

151
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,960
You can't defeat me.

152
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,216
Farewell.

153
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,761
Just disappear from this world.

154
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,185
The commander is really great!

155
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:00,812
Kill him, Gin!

156
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:02,814
Sanji!

157
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,404
Die!

158
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,246
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

159
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:51,211
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

160
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,332
That cook defeated Gin with only a kick!?

161
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:06,877
Even Gin can't defeat him?!

162
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,295
Idiots.

163
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:13,383
What have you seen till now with those eyes?

164
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:17,262
Gin is the Devil-man I praised!

165
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,475
That's why I gave him the position
of battle commander.

166
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,436
Soon, he will show his abilities.

167
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:32,194
Is Sanji alright?

168
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:33,570
How could he be?

169
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:35,530
Including the fight with the Iron Wall Man,
he's received 5 or 6 heavy hits.

170
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,700
Including the fight with the Iron Wall Man,
he's received 5 or 6 heavy hits.

171
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,911
This is nothing great.

172
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,621
You Octopus...

173
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:50,128
Battle commander... that's all you've got?

174
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,183
Why's he looking over there?

175
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:04,392
Ok!

176
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,954
I'm gonna use this opportunity to kick his ass!

177
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:16,905
Don't be so zealous!

178
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:36,273
You bastard!
Are you going to fight with me or not?

179
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,343
Fight with you?

180
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,470
Is it necessary?

181
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,681
I use methods to kill people.

182
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,602
It is a human's power.

183
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,146
Remember that, stinky monkey.

184
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,647
What?

185
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,442
You better be careful messin' with the monkey!

186
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,032
Sanji!

187
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,876
Yahoo!

188
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:14,212
That guy is severely injured now!

189
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,296
Kill him!

190
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,507
Damn it! If only the Iron Wall Man hadn't hit him!

191
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,178
He's already been hit 10 times by that steel ball!

192
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:31,062
This doesn't hurt a bit, small fry.

193
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,062
I'm beaten...

194
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,865
This guy is really strong.

195
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,820
Prepare to be finished.

196
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,030
I have played enough.

197
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,753
What's this? Mercy?

198
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,298
Are you joking?

199
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,051
Gin-san!

200
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:07,014
Sanji!

201
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,061
Sanji!

202
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,637
He can't take it any longer.

203
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:17,483
His body can't even withstand the
reaction from his own attacks!

204
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:33,624
Great!

205
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,335
Kill him, Gin!

206
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,173
Shit.

207
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:43,175
I can't.

208
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:10,910
What the hell?

209
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:15,290
I... Don Krieg.

210
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:22,839
I really...

211
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:29,137
I CAN'T KILL THIS MAN! DON KRIEG! !

212
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:33,475
Gin.

213
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,311
I really...

214
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:39,731
I really can't kill him.

215
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:42,609
What did you say?!!!

216
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:46,487
Because I... I...

217
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:48,239
I am...

218
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,491
For the first time...

219
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:55,621
This is worse, I won't accept mercy!

220
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,206
Take it away!

221
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:00,501
Don't be so tough, just eat it already.

222
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,504
To me, any hungry person's a customer.

223
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,674
Sorry, I can't pay for it.

224
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:11,979
I understand better than anyone else
the feeling of starving to death.

225
00:17:13,472 --> 00:17:15,508
You can die for your dignity.

226
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:19,786
But, isn't it that after you eat and
survive, and see tomorrow?

227
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,087
Delicious.

228
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:31,198
So delicious. It's too delicious!

229
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:32,691
I thought I was going to die.

230
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,493
I thought I was a goner.

231
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,914
Delicious, so delicious.

232
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:42,918
This is my first time eating something so good.

233
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,219
Good, ain't it?

234
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:54,013
I'm sorry, you're gonna get in trouble...

235
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:56,265
I'm sorry, you're gonna get in trouble...

236
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:58,475
Because you let me eat for free.

237
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,353
There's no evidence now, is there?

238
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:08,319
This is the first time

239
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,313
anyone has ever been kind to me...

240
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:14,742
That's why,

241
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,661
I can't kill this man.

242
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:19,962
Anytime!

243
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,600
I know.

244
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,604
I don't plan on ever betraying you,

245
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:32,042
I don't think anything we've done so far is wrong.

246
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:36,346
I respect your strength, and am grateful to you.

247
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:42,619
and I'm very happy that you praise my
strength and let me be the commander.

248
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:46,515
That's why I do whatever you say.

249
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,716
And I'll still do it in the future.

250
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:51,653
But...

251
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:55,323
I simply cannot kill this man!

252
00:19:03,415 --> 00:19:04,416
Don Krieg...

253
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,751
I beg of you...

254
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,965
Couldn't we just leave this restaurant alone?!

255
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:14,551
You bastard!!!

256
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:17,344
Not only do you disobey my orders,

257
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:20,598
But then you tell me what to do!

258
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:26,062
Do you wish to die so much?

259
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,648
I'm very disappointed in you.

260
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,150
Didn't I always say,

261
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,946
That I detest those feelings of principle?!

262
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,609
The rest of you go to one side.

263
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,163
Don! That...

264
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:48,543
MH5

265
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:51,212
The poisonous gas!?

266
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:51,754
What?

267
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:52,672
Poisonous gas?

268
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,716
Put on your Masks!!!

269
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:57,325
Or else we'll all be killed!
Put on your masks quickly!

270
00:19:57,325 --> 00:20:00,311
What the hell kind of weapon are you gonna use?
Using that kind of weapon! You bastard!

271
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:02,506
Don't you know the consequences of using it!?

272
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,392
Stop babbling over there!

273
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:06,602
This is a battle.

274
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,896
The purpose is to win.

275
00:20:09,897 --> 00:20:12,191
Treacherous? Despicable?

276
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,029
Don't you agree that this is acceptable?

277
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:19,198
Winning is the goal.

278
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:22,551
The method doesn't matter,
only the goal is important.

279
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:25,780
I don't care what consequence
the poisonous gas will bring.

280
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,039
As long as I win.

281
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,418
That is strength.

282
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:35,214
Damn bastard.

283
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:44,140
Throw away your mask!!!

284
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:49,311
You aren't one of mine anymore.

285
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:51,730
You must die.

286
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,241
I won't let you shoot that poisonous gas!

287
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:05,869
Stop interfering, Hammerboy.

288
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:20,092
Damn it!

289
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:21,677
Gin.

290
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,222
I've never heard such cowardly words.

291
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,767
I'm gonna destroy him.

292
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,563
Do not mock Don Krieg!

293
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:35,482
He's the strongest man alive!

294
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,818
And it's impossible for you to win.

295
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:40,404
You idiot! Open your eyes!

296
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:43,365
That guy's trying to kill you!

297
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,449
Of course.

298
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:48,036
For me to talk about my feelings,

299
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:51,081
Is to betray the role I have.

300
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:52,833
That's why...

301
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,460
That's why this is an obvious consequence!

302
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:57,963
Gin!

303
00:21:58,463 --> 00:22:00,382
Why? Why?

304
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,219
You realize at that end, eh?

305
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:06,346
But it's too late.

306
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,907
Die together with that cook.

307
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:11,852
POISONOUS GAS...

308
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,319
M

309
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,266
MH

310
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:14,862
MH5!

311
00:22:22,946 --> 00:22:24,322
Dive into the sea!

312
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:26,065
Owner! Into the restaurant, quickly!

313
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:30,578
I'm borrowin' this.

314
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,623
Sanji, Gin. Use it!

315
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:34,499
Waiter boy!

316
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,042
Now for mine...

317
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,587
ARA?! Everybody has submerged!

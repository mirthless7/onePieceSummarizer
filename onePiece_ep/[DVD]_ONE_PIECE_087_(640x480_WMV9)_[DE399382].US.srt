1
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:25,670
Against the Forces of Wapol!

2
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:25,670
Capacities of the Fruit Baku Baku!

3
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,090
This odor…

4
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,230
It is him!

5
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,590
Doctorine! Come quickly!

6
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,810
It…

7
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,050
Wapol is of return!

8
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,090
I see.

9
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,840
It is him?

10
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,480
This dumb of Jamagushi!

11
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,940
Look at, nothing did not change since my departure!

12
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,180
It is MY castle.

13
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,220
The Kingdom of Drum can finally reappear!

14
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,860
Please, Wapol-Sama!

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,430
Look at the top of the tower…!

16
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,200
What does this hideous flag make up there?

17
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,110
Where the flag of the Kingdom of Drum passed?!

18
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,450
I cramé it!

19
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,360
Te here is finally, Dr. Kureha!

20
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,290
The surviving last of my great “Hunting for the Doctors”.

21
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,090
This castle does not belong to you any more.

22
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,820
It is not a place for a band of snotty-nosed kid like you.

23
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,450
Leave this country!

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,180
The Kingdom of Drum does not exist any more.

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
What?

26
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,730
WAIT!

27
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,610
I will put a beating to him!

28
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,940
W-W-Wapol-Sama, it is straw hat!

29
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,170
Wapol-Sama!

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,460
It was right…

31
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,090
You gave us wire with retordre, the last time.

32
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,620
It would be said that you are still across our road.

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,830
What do they make here, these?

34
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,030
The other time, I had to escape because I carried the people wounded on my back, but this time…

35
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,730
I do not need more to retain me!

36
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,620
Dumb! How oses you to raise the hand on the King of the Kingdom of Drum…

37
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,630
… and to make this unforgivable act?!

38
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,390
Exact! He is the King of this country!

39
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,910
You are held in front of the King who controls all the inhabitants of the island!

40
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,630
And then?! I have anything with foutre strictly of it!

41
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,330
Eh kid.

42
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,940
You know them?

43
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,540
Ouais, it is Jamagushi!

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,740
Jamagushi the pirate!

45
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,630
Jamagushi?

46
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,260
It does to nothing but pose problems us!

47
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,990
He ate my boat and drove out my friends.

48
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,900
This time, it will not draw any on so good account!

49
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,780
, You wait do not have cold, equipped like that?

50
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,800
Look at yourself.

51
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,930
He said that he was a King?!

52
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,310
Then it is not a pirate!

53
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,620
DO NOT OCCUPY You OF HIM!

54
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,850
Ah! The imbecile!

55
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,130
Finally you realize of your insolence.

56
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,220
Wapol-Sama is the king of the Kingdom of Drum!

57
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,720
When we met it, he devoted himself temporarily to piracy for reasons which are clean for him.

58
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,400
But today, it is not pirate any more; it thus comes to take again its throne and to control this country again.

59
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,140
Eh! It curdles here!

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,630
It IS WHAT I STOPPED NOT SAYING to YOU!

61
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
It makes -50°C!

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,270
Do they foutent us?!

63
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,410
Wapol-Sama!

64
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,270
Now… I am really in anger.

65
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,430
Straw hat…

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,150
I will puff out you very believed!

67
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,910
Can Euh, said, you wait a little?

68
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,240
Luffy left to seek a jacket.

69
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,760
IT LEFT?!

70
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,010
I wanted to ask you…

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,010
Did its arms lengthen?

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,350
Ouais, it can lengthen them.

73
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,050
It is an elastic man.

74
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,170
C-how that?

75
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,090
It is a monster!

76
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,940
Like that, this old witch and Straw hat squattent my castle.

77
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:24,790
Once these eliminated dogs, nobody any more will dare to rebel against me!

78
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,490
You are right completely.

79
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,550
This day will be that of the glorious return of the Kingdom of Drum!

80
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,070
And you will pass there the first, Dr. Kureha!

81
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,200
You one right cheek to install you in my castle during my absence!

82
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
You even set up this monstrous flag there!

83
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,490
This castle is fall it from Hiluluk.

84
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,160
I insane completion of this dilapidated place.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,770
I see that you did not realize that it is this reindeer which hoisted the flag of Hiluluk up there.

86
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,260
This flag with the tête de mort enabled me to face all the diseases!

87
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,410
Tête de mort?

88
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,270
It is the symbol of a will which defies the impossible one!

89
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,320
As a doctor, I must save this country!

90
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,950
While raising this flag, I will fight like a pirate!

91
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,580
The Doctor fought to save this country…

92
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,580
To raise this flag…

93
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,340
Lead me near the patients!

94
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,470
I came to look after Isshi-20!

95
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,660
You still do not include/understand? It is a trap!

96
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,110
Isshi-20 go very well, as you can note it!

97
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,590
What?

98
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,540
I am relieved. Nobody is sick here.

99
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,080
I really thought that the country was in danger.

100
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,480
That to say if it is not that… I fell into the panel.

101
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,170
Eh yes.

102
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,490
When do you believe that people die?

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,290
Doctor!

104
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,840
When a ball in full heart is drawn to them?

105
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
Not.

106
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,230
When they are reached of a terminal illness?

107
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,850
Not.

108
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,940
When they take a soup of champignons vénéneux?

109
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,970
Not!

110
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,380
They die when… they fall into the lapse of memory.

111
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,430
Even after my death, my dream will be carried out.

112
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,140
The ravaged heart of the people will be cured.

113
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,770
Why do you cry, Dalton?

114
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,650
You think… that it is the same thing for this country?

115
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,340
Will is needed.

116
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,620
Do not worry you, Chopper.

117
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,420
It is not your mushroom which will be right of me…

118
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,160
It was really a formidable life!

119
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,340
Good-bye, charlatan.

120
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,940
Thank you in you, Chopper!

121
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,170
The Doctor in front of this castle…

122
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,180
He died to save this country!

123
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,330
And now…

124
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,690
It is fall it from the Doctor!

125
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,050
Fall it?

126
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,110
Of this imbecile of doctor?

127
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,360
To profane my castle with this dirtiness of flag?!

128
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,980
CRAMEZ ME THIS FLAG AT ONCE!

129
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,970
You will not put the feet in this castle…

130
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,520
NEVER.

131
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,950
Wapol-Sama, it is…

132
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,850
I remember! This day…

133
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,120
It is him, the monster which ran after this stupid doctor!

134
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,950
This flag represents…

135
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,490
… will of the Doctor.

136
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,520
I will not allow anybody to touch there!

137
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,930
NEVER!

138
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,820
No pity!

139
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,240
We will take again the castle!

140
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,320
Do not save anybody!

141
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,750
You will also fight, grandmother?

142
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,890
Grandmother?

143
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,890
If you cannot occupy you, I will undertake some.

144
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,030
Thank you well…

145
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,100
Wapol-Sama, leave the-me!

146
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,130
I will do myself them one by one!

147
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,710
Doctorine!

148
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,740
He, He, He Afroman!

149
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,460
To balance your ball afro on a woman, that is not made, my brother!

150
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,990
I see that ended you up including/understanding.

151
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,690
Ca sticks.

152
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,410
What?! What occurs with this foutue swell afro?!

153
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,710
Static electricity?

154
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,480
Precisely.

155
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,270
Ca curdles… that curdles!

156
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,410
A jacket… a jacket… a jacket…!

157
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,120
Where is my jacket?

158
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,530
What occurs outside?

159
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,780
There is much noise.

160
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,770
Outside, it curdles.

161
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,450
You do not know where is my jacket?

162
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,680
It is not what I asked you.

163
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,760
I want to know what occurs outside.

164
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,340
Oh, just a small brawl.

165
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,430
Isn't all is well?

166
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,050
Yes. Rendors.

167
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,950
You can take my jacket.

168
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,520
Your jacket is really not signal!

169
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,230
In any case, it holds hotter than holds it!

170
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,130
Did Ah ouais?

171
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,250
Good of agreement, since I do not have cold.

172
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:13,690
I go back there!

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,630
And to say that I thought that it occurred something.

174
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,500
Dumb!

175
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,620
I will make you the skin, Jamagushi!

176
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,640
SHIT!

177
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,270
It is what this ball afro?!
I cannot disencumber me!

178
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,490
When there is not more, there is still!

179
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,130
Electric Marimo

180
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,290
Whore, it is what these tricks?!

181
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,630
Moreover, it is disgusting!

182
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,430
Eh, the reindeer!

183
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,910
Instead of you to turn the inches, come to help me!

184
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,970
I arrive!

185
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,460
Quickly, removes to me these tricks!

186
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,760
It is too feeling reluctant!

187
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,220
And it is disgusting! It is disgusting!

188
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,970
Ca is stuck to me maintaining, take again it!

189
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,140
Moron, does not give again them to me!

190
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,310
Guards at least one!

191
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,730
Not question, it is feeling reluctant!

192
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,060
Ca returns to me sick!

193
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,020
Stop!

194
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,920
But what do you foutez, both?

195
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,360
It would be said that you do not have the esprit d'équipe.

196
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,050
Let warn you to me, Eleki-Marimo are perhaps “feeling reluctant”, but they are very flammable.

197
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,640
Shit!

198
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,140
It will put fire at the balls afro!

199
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,830
He! Where you go?!

200
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,810
To launch the Soft food Plan!

201
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,040
The Soft food Plan…?

202
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,780
BUT It IS ME the SOFT FOOD?!

203
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,830
Snow! Snow! Snow!

204
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,180
Release!

205
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,290
Wapol-Sama!

206
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,230
Oh not!

207
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,860
Chopper!

208
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,370
Ah! Attention, I arrive!

209
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,260
Luffy!

210
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,140
My leg catches!

211
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,850
Your leg?

212
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,350
Like that?

213
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,050
It is impec, clings well!

214
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,230
Not badly.

215
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,000
Thank you! You are really brilliant!

216
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,130
He, Luffy!

217
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,300
Ca would not be the jacket of Nami-San only you carry?!

218
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:44,990
Ouais.

219
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,200
Look at! This guy is always in life!

220
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,770
It is its hippo which was dispatched in the airs.

221
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,620
Remove it! Shit!

222
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,520
Are Wapol-Sama, you well?

223
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,740
They are much stronger than it was thought!

224
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,690
I hate them!

225
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,700
I… all will kill them!

226
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,330
I will show them…

227
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,800
… capacities of the Fruit Baku Baku!

228
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Wapol-Sama…

229
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,360
Look at doing me, now!

230
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,550
Oh! It was raised!

231
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,450
It should not be able to be raised after such a blow.

232
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,410
It is really resistant!

233
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:18,910
Chess!

234
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,380
Say to me what we had with the menu today.

235
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,070
Then, on the boat, we had “a gun jumped to butter”, “a rare extra gun”…

236
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,840
… and to finish, “one salade composée of powder and boulet de canon”.

237
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,020
We also had “a house roasted” at the village.

238
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,800
But it puffs out anything, that one?!

239
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,600
It must surely puff out all that it finds.

240
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,880
Observe attentively…

241
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,830
… how I transform my meals into flesh and bone!

242
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,430
It prepares something…

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,310
What?

244
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,470
Shoku = Food

245
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,600
A house?!

246
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,250
Supeeeer!

247
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,720
I keep the best for the end!

248
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,830
My royal technique!

249
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,480
What?!

250
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,200
IT IS PUFFING OUT ITS HENCHMEN!

251
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,880
It IS a CANNIBAL!

252
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,870
He finished.

253
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,950
Now, let us see seeing!

254
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,380
This splendid fusion!

255
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,370
What? A fusion?

256
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,090
I am the largest warrior of the Kingdom of Drum…

257
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,750
CHESSMARIMO!

258
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,180
PF, there is of them just one which is assembled on the shoulders of the other…

259
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,470
Too much brilliant!

260
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,610
DECREE TO SAY CONNERIES!

261
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,000
Remain your guards of course.

262
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,980
If they were as weak as they have the air of it,

263
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,830
their hunting for the doctors would have been a failure.

264
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,700
And the plain people could have put an end to it.

265
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,190
Regulate n°1 with the Kingdom of Drum:

266
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,340
“All those which disobey the king die!”

267
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,600
It is like that one controls this country!

268
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,920
Because this country is my country…

269
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,840
and this castle is my castle!

270
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,350
I will never admit that a shit of flag as that of this foutu doctor is hoisted there!

271
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,810
He soils the castle!

272
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,470
The symbol of the pirates…

273
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,290
He, the reindeer.

274
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,500
This flag…

275
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,930
For a man who raises the banner to the tête de mort, nothing is impossible!

276
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,700
It is what I taught you, Chopper!

277
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Eh you! It is the flag of the Doctor!

278
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,380
The Doctor tried to save you too!

279
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,420
Chopper.

280
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,500
Do not hate the men.

281
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,230
Now, this country is sick.

282
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,640
The heart of the king is sick.

283
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,360
Why?

284
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,570
Is doctor… it likely no there to save this man?

285
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,340
I…

286
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,670
I will not have any evil…

287
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,900
… if you free this country immediately!

288
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,970
But what you tell, Chopper?!

289
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,340
You really believe to be able to reason a type like him?

290
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,710
But… I want just…

291
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,970
CHOPPER!

292
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,590
He, Jamagushi!

293
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,110
Straw hat!

294
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,140
When you claimed to be a pirate, that was only one lie, hein?

295
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,080
A pirate who did not want to risk his life…

296
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,700
You do not even know what this pirate flag represents!

297
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,270
What it…

298
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,380
Does what represent a pirate flag, Straw hat?

299
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,380
How if this stupid banner could represent something!

300
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,550
This is why you are if loose!

301
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,650
How?

302
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,770
One does not defend this flag with the light one!

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,820
Imbecile!

304
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,480
How if the king could die to hold up a pirate flag!

305
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,020
And you oses to put this flag up there!

306
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,210
Attention with you! It draws you above!

307
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,150
You believe that you can destroy this flag?

308
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,910
Luffy!

309
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,590
It touched it!

310
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,880
I dispatched you in the airs, microbe!

311
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,330
You see!

312
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,930
It is not destroyed!

313
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,590
Im-impossible!

314
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,090
It is nutcase!

315
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,950
I do not know with whom is this pirate flag, nor from where it comes…

316
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,560
… but it is a flag for which one engages his life!

317
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,460
One does not defend it with the light one!

318
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,120
IT IS NOT a FLAG WHICH YOU CAN HAVE FUN TO CLEAN UP!!

319
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,570
Narcotic…

320
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,710
It is thus that…

321
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,360
… a pirate!

322
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,790
You will never destroy it.

323
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,170
The tête de mort symbolizes our conviction!

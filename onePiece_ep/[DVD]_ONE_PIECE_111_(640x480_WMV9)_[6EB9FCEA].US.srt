1
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:50,140
The race with the miracles!

2
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:50,140
Arabasta, country of the animals

3
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,580
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,360
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,110
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,020
Luffy and its crew succeeded in escaping from the trap of Rain Dinners.

7
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,450
The 2 million men who account the Army Rebels directs towards Alubarna.

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,940
Attracted in an ambush tended by Crocodile, a great battle occurred.

9
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,320
But, confronted with its incommensurable power,

10
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,000
Luffy is completely made crush.

11
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,760
Does this terrible fact mark the end of this apogee?

12
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,090
Look at!

13
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,180
I it has there so much!

14
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,550
Look at…!

15
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,410
It is water…

16
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,720
Water remakes surface!

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,880
I had not said it, Luffy?

18
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,950
This ground is strong.

19
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,030
Yuba is always in life!

20
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,060
Yuba will die.

21
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
With this ultimate tempête de sable.

22
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,020
And the heinous flame of the rebellious army will burn again.

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,530
This feeling of compassion will destroy this country.

24
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,750
The same applies to you, straw hat, Luffy.

25
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,960
If you had been unaware of these stupid feelings as of the beginning, you would have lived longer.

26
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,920
Water…

27
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,560
And I suppose that you are not also any more grateful for this water.

28
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,270
Impossible.

29
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,160
You are always in life?

30
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,780
You seem to suffer enormously.

31
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,500
But you will find soon peace.

32
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,820
Good-bye.

33
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,260
Which waste of time…

34
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,000
What?

35
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,310
We will fight this sand.

36
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,460
And it will still rain.

37
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,710
As that always was.

38
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,580
STILL AND STILL, SHOW ME WHAT YOU ARE WORTH, TEMPETE DE SABLE!

39
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,050
YUBA WILL NEVER BE DESTROYED BY SAND!!

40
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,780
And afterwards, at this time precis,

41
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,710
I was turned over and I said to him:

42
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,990
“YOU HAVE THE TWISTED LEGS!!”

43
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,840
And thanks to that, all the crabs of the world noticed their twisted legs.

44
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,440
Thus therefore they go on side…

45
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,160
Ouais.

46
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,440
Moreover, there was another animal which jumped everywhere behind him.

47
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,570
It was a shrimp!

48
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,220
But then, the shrimps are also crabs?

49
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,520
Ouais, they are crabs.

50
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,880
Wouldn't Zoro, you be wasting your forces?

51
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
Close it.

52
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,470
Thus leave it, Nami-San.

53
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,580
If it is not involved, it accumulates too much tension.

54
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,610
And it raises it moreover easily.

55
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,990
And especially…

56
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,740
It has just realized of the power of Shichibukai.

57
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,550
He, dumb.

58
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,280
What try to you to say?

59
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,870
Spit!

60
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,650
Well, I you will say it.

61
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,300
You are afraid.

62
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,620
That Luffy can lose.

63
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,080
ME!?

64
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,670
FEAR!?

65
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,800
YOU…

66
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,880
SALT QUEER!

67
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,740
Tain'!!!! You irritate me!

68
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,490
Green foam head!

69
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
WHAT!?

70
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,710
You want to fight, moron!?

71
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,990
You stop!

72
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,800
It is not the moment.

73
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,270
Well, well.

74
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,320
This dispute put everyone on the nerves.

75
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,220
It is the moment for me, the vice-captain of…

76
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,280
He is well!

77
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,230
Listen to all…

78
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,660
Huh?

79
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,830
Luffy-San will not lose!

80
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,600
We made a promise, not?

81
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,450
We said that we will await it Alubarna!

82
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,280
It IS YOU WHO WORRY You MORE!

83
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,930
Deal only with the rebellion.

84
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,360
If one did not follow oneself, one would be completely lost.

85
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,450
Afflicted, Vivi-Chan.

86
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,250
Yosh!

87
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,410
Now let us travel towards Alubarna!

88
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,660
Ahead, Pincemie!

89
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,080
What is it?

90
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,330
It is the name of crab.

91
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,640
Pincemy!?

92
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,400
Does Ca pose a problem to you!?

93
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,200
At all.

94
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,160
You order to me to go in Alubarna?

95
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,600
Do I have to continue the pirate straw hat?

96
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,370
Or do I have to lend assistance to the royal army?

97
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,430
I trust you.

98
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,380
When you are there, you will decide.

99
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,110
But…

100
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,110
What do you want to say?

101
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,910
Am right clean tone direction of justice.

102
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,860
It does not matter what occurs…

103
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,560
I will take the whole responsability for it.

104
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,900
Colonel Smoker, where do you go?

105
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,450
Urgent businesses.

106
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,220
I must take again the sea.

107
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,940
Be held lends to receive orders at any time, Tashigi.

108
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,190
Yes!

109
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,810
Look at very attentively what occurs in this country.

110
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,410
Whether it is destroyed, or that it survives.

111
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,780
It is the kind of thing which occurs with the turning of a new era.

112
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,120
Sergeant!

113
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,330
Sergeant!

114
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:30,990
Your orders?

115
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,180
Yes!

116
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,700
Look at very attentively what occurs in this country.

117
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,320
Whether it is destroyed, or that it survives.

118
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,840
It is the kind of thing which occurs with the turning of a new era.

119
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,390
We will continue the Luffy pirate with the straw hat, and its crew.

120
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,440
All the units, gather your business for the departure!

121
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,100
You and on the way for Alubarna equip!

122
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,190
With your orders!

123
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,100
Luffy with the straw hat.

124
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,230
WHAT!?

125
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,580
THIS CRAB CANNOT CROSS THE RIVER!?

126
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,800
The “Crab-Mobiles” live in the desert.

127
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,320
They do not support water.

128
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,070
But it is a crab!
A CRAB!

129
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,510
It is not a shrimp, of agreement!?

130
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,090
MADE SOMETHING!

131
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,020
He, they is not good!
Ca poses problems!

132
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,240
Look at that!

133
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,530
This river is practically an ocean, if we are not able to cross it, we will never arrive in time!

134
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,010
And even if one manages to cross this river, there remains still ten kilometers to be traversed in the desert!

135
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,430
If this crab does not manage to reach the other shore,

136
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,200
we are good to run the remainder of the way!?

137
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,430
I think that one does not have the choice.

138
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,280
ONE WILL NEVER ARRIVE THERE!

139
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,050
Y' does not have an other way!

140
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,570
Shit!

141
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,780
He, here is the river!

142
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,550
I see Sandora!

143
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,290
What?

144
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,630
Please, do something, Pincemie-Kun!

145
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,720
Yes!

146
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,820
Pincemy adores the dancers!

147
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,100
Like us?

148
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,030
Perhaps.

149
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,380
OHHHHH!!!!

150
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,440
It looks in this direction!

151
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,970
It accelerated!

152
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,490
NAMI-SWAAANNN!

153
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,370
You managed to persuade two animals thanks to your talents!

154
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,410
Brilliant, ERO POWER!!

155
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,640
And… in what will that solve our problem?

156
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,680
CHOPPER!?

157
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,640
GO!

158
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,240
BRILLIANT!

159
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,720
Ho, Ho, Ho!

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,100
It is really astonishing.

161
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,170
I cannot believe it.

162
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,050
It is formidable!

163
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,210
It is a miracle!

164
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,070
Maintenances at water surface in this direction!

165
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,380
Course! Course! Course in this direction!

166
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,410
Go!

167
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,400
You can do it!

168
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
You will arrive there!

169
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,010
You do it!

170
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,330
You are a crab, you can do it!

171
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,400
Now, starts to swim!

172
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,180
Does He, it occur what?

173
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,940
It runs?

174
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,590
One runs!?

175
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,420
We run!!

176
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,020
DO NOT RUN, STUPID CRAB!

177
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,680
There are not time to hear you groan.

178
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,650
Advances.

179
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,640
Oh. Have-await one second.

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,530
There is no boat!?

181
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,540
Which distance separates us from other bank?

182
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,640
Approximately 50 km.

183
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,100
ONE CANNOT SWIM ALSO FAR!

184
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,650
Thank you!

185
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,050
Thank you, Pincemie!

186
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,890
It is not really the moment to thank it, not!?

187
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,430
What is it…?

188
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,460
A rare catfish of Sandora!

189
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,150
They are called as that because it is extremely rare to see one of them!

190
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,960
Save to us your tourist details!

191
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,610
And the human ones are its favorite food!

192
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,020
WOULD HAVE TO SAY CA IN FIRST to you!!!

193
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,130
He, is pushed!

194
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,380
I see more anything!

195
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,890
Chopper! Push yourself!

196
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,460
Kung Fu Dugong!

197
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,910
They said:“One could not give up the disciples of our Master”

198
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,320
Euh… one is not really the disciples of Luffy…

199
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,780
But at least, one is healthy and safe!

200
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,080
Oué, it remains to us still way to be made!

201
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
With the next one!

202
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,760
Thank you!

203
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,760
Bye Bye!

204
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,650
One is in times.

205
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,710
You think that one can do it?

206
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,030
It is difficult to say.

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,030
Even with Matsuge-Kun, that is likely to be hard.

208
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,790
And it cannot transport…

209
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,280
that… two people!

210
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,130
And if Works Baroque attacks us, they will do it more close to the city!

211
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,860
There is not another way so that one travels all together?

212
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,260
Does shit, nobody have an idea?

213
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,750
Look at!

214
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,370
Over there!

215
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,170
What is it? An enemy!?

216
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,540
III they come towards us!?

217
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,240
Not, it is…

218
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,430
Karu!

219
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,630
The squadron of the super-mallards!

220
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,400
You came to help us!

221
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,920
Karu!

222
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,090
MEAT!

223
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,580
You and me…

224
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,850
… sums of the pirates of different classes.

225
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,240
Yuba will die.

226
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,020
And the heinous flame of the rebellious army will burn again.

227
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,990
Mercy…

228
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,320
Why do you fight?

229
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,400
You who bear the name of “D”?

230
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,270
D?

231
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,020
Who are you with the Juste?

232
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,190
It is a rather useless question.

233
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,900
I found you!

234
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,430
Where is Vivi-Sama!?

235
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,310
Ah?

236
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,330
Already upright?

237
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,420
I know your capacities now.

238
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,460
Ca will not be as easy as the last time!

239
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,430
Do not do too much of it.

240
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,310
You are seriously wounded.

241
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,990
Which perfect synchronization.

242
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,290
You can save this man who to lie there.

243
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:34,680
It is this valiant knight knight who brought your invaluable Princesse up to now.

244
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,820
And your Princess is in perfect health.

245
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,550
She is on the way for Alubarna at the time when we speak.

246
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,910
I do not know what will occur.

247
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,210
I do not know what will occur.

248
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,050
The things are what they are, after all.

249
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,510
If I can nothing make for it, which can protect Vivi-Sama?

250
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,850
MEAT!

251
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,430
You do not lose anything to wait, Cobra!

252
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,930
We will protect Arabasta!

253
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,480
Your reign touches at its end!

254
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,170
Capital of the Kingdom - Alubarna

255
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,310
Quickly!

256
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,960
Do not weaken!

257
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,910
Keep rate!

258
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,120
Prepare the guns with the Southern Door!

259
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,170
Do not lose a minute!

260
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:50,810
Quickly!

261
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,470
Bring more boulets de canon!

262
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,900
Chaka-Sama!

263
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,000
The number of rebels exceeds the 2 million easily.

264
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,320
Say to me, that you of the attack of the King think on Nanohana?

265
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,430
I was useful under the orders of his majesty during ten years, it does not have there reason to believe…

266
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,960
Yes, there is no proof that it is him.

267
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,010
It is unthinkable that a thing arrived to the King to make it change as much.

268
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,530
Thus, it is paramount not to lose this battle.

269
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,610
Let us not be afraid of the number of enemies.

270
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,380
For our King!

271
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,920
And for the return of Vivi-Sama!

272
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,860
WE WILL PROTECT THIS COUNTRY UNTIL THE END!

273
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,300
How all the not requisitioned civilians evacuate the city!

274
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,100
We cannot protect the lives from those which remain!

275
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,840
Run! You are likely to be taken in the battle!

276
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,380
Look at as agitation starts to reign here.

277
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:53,800
You dispatch and that the battle begins.
One waits there and one is bored.

278
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,650
I make fun to know if it is the good King or anyone of other.

279
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,920
It is out of the question which I remain here to observe this type!

280
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,650
Out of the question!
Not! Not! and Not!

281
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,590
Of course, to infiltrate in the palate by thwarting the vigilance of the guards and to remove this type…

282
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,330
… was a mission made for us.

283
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,950
But maintaining that is enough, one should not be wedged here to be bored to die like that!

284
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,600
Not true, Mr. 4?

285
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,770
Euh…

286
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,580
You me listenings or what!?

287
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,190
What are slow for you.
Slow to answer. Frankly.

288
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,630
Ah, that gives me badly with the hip! My sciatica!

289
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,220
Chaka…

290
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,470
Kohza…

291
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,480
You should not beat you.

292
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,480
You are what makes this country.

293
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,400
You should not destroy you mutually!

294
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,490
Those which deplore the combat.

295
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,740
Those which will fight.

296
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,480
Allons-y!

297
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,350
Those which encourage with violence.

298
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,060
And those which know the truth and which will try to prevent it.

299
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,960
Each one carries its convictions.

300
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,270
They will run up in the capital, Alubarna!

301
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,080
The port city - Nanohana

302
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,990
The final rebellion started.

303
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,940
Their boat was there.

304
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,630
I hope that Vivi-Sama and the others arrived healthy and safe, but…

305
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,270
I must make quickly!

306
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,290
I hope only that I will arrive in time!

1
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,029
Too much coooool!

2
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,289
Delicious!

3
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:57,819
They is good?

4
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,150
A room V.I.P? I do not include/understand.

5
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
Not, not, it is not that…

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,180
I decided not to pay only one Berry.

7
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,980
Thank you for these good repairs!

8
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,980
Customers, should cease to you making fun you of the carpenters.

9
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,850
Ah… Excuse me.

10
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,650
In the carpenters, the pirates cannot impose their rules.

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,080
This tower is one of the elevators.

12
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,170
All is so large!

13
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,150
They are strong…

14
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,700
They are qualified…

15
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,960
They are the pride of Seven Toilets!

16
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,270
Effrayaaaant!

17
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,889
It is what?

18
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,420
It is a shop of masks.

19
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,430
CP9

20
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,700
Robin?

21
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,259
I thought that I attacked somebody of deadened…

22
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:55,140
Franky Family
and Iceberg-san.

23
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,940
Who are you, dumbs?

24
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,540
Answer!

25
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,410
“Answer”, you say? Eh?

26
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,220
Zoro the hunter of pirates!

27
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:28,910
We are bargain hunters!
Known under the name of Franky Family!

28
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,999
We will accept readily your premium of 60 million.

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,250
We wanted to take to you in ambush on the bridge…

30
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,930
And to capture the remainder of the group in the tread!

31
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,860
An enormous profit! Lucky!

32
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,090
I am the first!

33
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,880
“Lucky”?

34
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,800
Isn't this rather “Unlucky”?

35
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,070
No the hesitation!

36
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,369
Style with two sabers…

37
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,980
NITOU RYU

38
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,720
SAI KURU

39
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,420
Completely null…

40
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,490
Me-shit!

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,260
It is here!

42
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,760
Then, that do I can for you?

43
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,380
We want to exchange that.

44
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,960
How much that made?

45
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,480
Mr. Director! It is a serious business!

46
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,000
Such-so much of gold!

47
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,710
What?! Send immediately them in room VIP.

48
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,269
They is marrowy!

49
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,210
And that rebounds! Are these seats filled with water also, nan?

50
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400
Isn't Oi, according to you, they are not counterfeits?

51
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,570
In any way!
I have been an expert inspector for 25 years!

52
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,500
With a rather fast evaluation, that is worth…

53
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,940
C… HUNDRED MILLION BERRYS??!!

54
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,329
Baka! You speak too extremely!
No matter who can hear!

55
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,309
really Have-have-have-go we to have as much money?!

56
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,170
Luffy, you speak still too extremely!

57
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,249
There that is worth certainly this price!

58
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,270
They are very old, and originally preserved… gold is splendid.

59
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,530
It is largely sufficient to repair Going Merry!

60
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,380
We will have money to do it.

61
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,459
Then we will be able to buy a bronze statue with the remainder of the money.

62
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,070
Do not buy that, does not buy that…

63
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,200
If we start to make the agreement…

64
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,559
Please sign then leave a print of inch.

65
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,230
I will prepare your money immediately.

66
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,260
Yosh!
I will leave my prints several times!

67
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,840
If it is not sufficient, I will do it too!

68
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,290
What? What doesn't go Nami?

69
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,590
I have three things to say…

70
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,220
Mr. expert inspector.

71
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,390
Firstly:

72
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,330
I forgot to say it to you, but this guy has a premium of 100 million on his head.

73
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,650
Secondo:

74
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,380
I am not agreement with this conclusion.

75
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,450
Thirdly:

76
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,000
If you lie us once again…

77
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,350
I remake you the face.

78
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,440
It is all…

79
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,539
Pa-forgiveness!!

80
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,600
Tr-trois hundred million Berrys?!
This is a dream?!

81
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,469
Our adventure in Sorajimas paid finally well!

82
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,739
I am somebody of very rich!

83
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,970
“We” are!

84
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Thank you to be come…

85
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,209
We have 300 million.

86
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,460
And I carry 100 million!

87
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,390
Nami is really alarming when it makes threats!

88
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,529
I included/understood its swindles because I had already made an estimate.

89
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,999
Then when he said 100 million…

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,899
You were excited, then it tried to swindle you.

91
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,350
Oi, Luffy! Do not balance the bag like that…

92
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,230
Good, in any case, they is cool. Very happened well.

93
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,779
IT GOES IN THE RIVER!!

94
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,340
The 100 million Berrys will fall into water!

95
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,090
It was right, it was right.

96
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,249
I will kill you!!

97
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,200
I will remake you the portrait!!

98
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,770
Déf…, I flee défolé…

99
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,120
You heard that?

100
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,229
Ouais, 300 million Berrys.

101
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,439
It is the crew of Straw hat.

102
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,980
It is a large sum which the total of their premiums.

103
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,939
Change of strategy.

104
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,330
Oi, let us call the others on the boat.

105
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,489
Eh, Nami. Don't you think that it would be to better bring back the money to the boat?

106
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,120
It would be too long, the boat is with the other end of the city, on this hill.

107
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,320
Oi, I am shocked a little that you do not entrust any more the money to me!

108
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,630
Now, if we could just meet a carpenter.

109
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,760
We will have to turn over to Merry to make an estimate of the price of repairs.

110
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,539
I see, I included/understood.

111
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,520
I never kept as much money, I do not know what I must do.

112
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,709
It is a normal reaction.

113
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,099
We do not have the same reactions as a guy who makes whirl money in the vacuum.

114
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,879
[Manjuu = Brioche cooked with the vapor with yeast so that it goes up]

115
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,719
I will buy a hundred of it.

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,379
The farm!

117
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,309
Then thousands.

118
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,009
The farm!

119
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,329
Then ten millet…

120
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,370
The farm!

121
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,390
We returned at the entry of the shipyard.

122
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,350
Well… One would say the place where crowd was.

123
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,339
In all the cases let us find…

124
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,699
… The um… how is it called T?

125
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,770
Iceberg-san.

126
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,400
Ouais, Ice-ossan.

127
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,569
With what does resemble T it?

128
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,039
The grandmother of the station said that it was advised to ask him for our repairs.

129
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,700
Who could know it?

130
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,689
For the moment, can we enter here?

131
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,159
Afflicted disturbance…

132
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,500
Still a connery…

133
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,690
Oups there…

134
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,210
Please… you wait are a foreigner, not?

135
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,090
Above all, let us speak outside.

136
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,500
Nobody enters the workshop separately the authorized personnel.

137
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,770
Do you have an order to make in this dock?

138
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,369
Ah, it is Usopp.

139
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,330
Oi! I am here on your line, Luffy!

140
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,629
It is true, him its nose is square!

141
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,160
That means that it is square Usopp!

142
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,670
My nose is not triangular, nor square!

143
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,970
We want to ask you for hum… I will like to meet Iceberg-san.

144
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
Iceberg-san?

145
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,100
A customer?

146
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,290
Ah, I see.

147
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,190
It is a letter of recommendation of the Kokoro old woman of the Shift station, it is that?

148
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,530
Huh?  Be to you an old man?

149
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,490
I am 23 years old!

150
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,139
“I am 23 years old”… You speak like an old man.

151
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,979
One often says that to me!

152
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,740
Then, do you know this man, Iceberg?

153
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,710
I know it, as everyone here… it is the mayor of Seven Toilets.

154
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,759
It is so important?

155
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,410
There is not only that…

156
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,420
It is the director of Galley it Company and…

157
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,039
It is also the contractor of Umi Ressha.

158
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,879
This most important of this city is?!

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,560
Ben, it has there nobody in Water Seven which does not know it.

160
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,539
Where can we meet it?

161
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,280
Where could it be in this moment?

162
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,800
It is difficult to say, considering it is a very occupied man.

163
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,379
It is possible to contact it?

164
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,470
It is not impossible but… are you in a hurry?

165
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,040
We are not in a hurry but…

166
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,780
In fact does, this conversation relate to the repair of a boat, not?

167
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,420
Where is your boat moored?

168
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,449
Ah… on the rock hill.

169
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,340
Yosh… then I will see and evaluate the conditions of the boat.

170
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,660
In your conversation with Iceberg-san when you meet it.

171
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,160
You will be able to discuss the price with him.

172
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,240
See? With Yagara Bull?

173
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,439
If I did that, you would have the impression to wait eternally.

174
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Well, have patience just 10 minutes

175
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,710
10 minutes?

176
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,620
Yes… 10 minutes…

177
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,700
Too much fast!

178
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,250
It flies!

179
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,029
But wait… beyond here it is…

180
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,460
A CLIFF!

181
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,580
It fell!

182
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,889
Impressing!

183
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,930
It is well?

184
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,010
He travels freely in all the city…

185
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,730
People call it the wind of the mountain…

186
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,820
Of Galley it Company, dock n°1…

187
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,940
Foreman carpenter…

188
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Kaku!

189
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,540
Well, well, I see…

190
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,030
It is a water city. Very impressive.

191
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,879
Rivers and fountains…

192
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,469
Beautiful streets filled with world…

193
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,620
And a package of beautiful women.

194
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,730
I will like to have a date with Nami-san and Robin-chan in this splendid city!

195
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,200
A beautiful flower in each hand, that would give good impression…

196
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,090
It is Nami-san and it is Robin-chan…

197
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,030
Hey, nii-chan.

198
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,619
Do not make such a strange head.

199
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
Which mizu-mizu Chinese cabbage do you want?

200
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,090
[Oba-chan = Lady of Middle Age]

201
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,070
I want the products freshest of the city. What do you have?

202
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,880
Mizu-mizu apples and mizu-mizu pears.

203
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,599
Do you need fresh fish?
My husband left to the fishmonger.

204
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,880
Where is it?

205
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,670
Go on the dry land a few times then turns to 6th on the right and 12th on the left.

206
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,909
Hum… and now…

207
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,670
These tricks are surely shaken when I walk…

208
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,160
Still a cul-de-sac? Fact of shitting…

209
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,260
Am I lost?

210
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,499
They is not good…

211
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,120
That makes me resemble a certain swashbuckler of shit…

212
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,390
Robin-chaaaaann!

213
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,239
Ooooi, it is me!

214
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,239
Yahoo!

215
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,980
Robin-chan…

216
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,650
Disappeared?

217
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,820
However, there is neither carries nor passage…

218
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,650
Did it fly away or other?

219
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,810
Usopp?

220
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,900
Which is the problem in this city?

221
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,670
Or it is me which am badly?

222
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,050
It is the boat.

223
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,990
Excuse me.

224
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,600
Oh, it is Usopp.

225
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,660
I see, it is very damaged.

226
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,920
The mast needs to be replaced, it is sure.

227
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,810
Usopp?

228
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,299
WAIT ONE MINUTE!

229
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,279
You ES WHICH YOU!

230
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,320
Did my excuses, I awake you?

231
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,069
It has surprised me.

232
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,539
It flew from here!

233
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,480
Nmaa… To have banals engineers would be damage…

234
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,520
Who is this?

235
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,189
To manufacture a boat of quality quickly…

236
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,710
Normal physical capacities are not enough.

237
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,529
Moreover, Kalifa…

238
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,220
Yes, I made research on them.

239
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,940
Luffy with the straw hat, Zoro the hunter of pirates, Nico Robin…

240
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,939
The total sum of their premiums is of…

241
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,459
239 million Berrys.

242
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,200
They are originating in East Blue.

243
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,350
Currently, they are a group of seven known under the name of “the crew of the Straw hat”

244
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,010
They know all…

245
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,979
I see, welcome.

246
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,500
I am the chief of the city, Iceberg.

247
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,310
And this mouse which I have just found…

248
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,010
Its name is… see seeing…

249
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,410
Tyranosaure.

250
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,360
It is necessary to prepare food and a cage.

251
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,920
It is already done, Iceberg-san.

252
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,209
Nmaa, you are very far-sighted, Kalifa.

253
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,410
I am touched.

254
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,229
In addition…

255
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,160
In 10 minutes you have a dinner with the chiefs of the manufacturers of glass to the Chiza Hotel.

256
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,930
Then, a reading in the Riburia place.

257
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,190
When it is finished, a conversation with Sir Bimine, the mayor of Pucchi.

258
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,519
Later, you will have an interview of the company of newspapers…

259
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,059
Then we will return to the main office of the company…

260
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,160
To note your prospects officially.

261
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,780
I do not want!

262
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,219
Ok, I cancel all.

263
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,440
Can Oi, you do that?

264
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,790
I am a person of being able who can make this type of things.

265
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,739
You are completely bad as a mayor!

266
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,959
Which egoistic person.

267
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,219
But it is not the person about which the grandmother spoke?

268
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,199
Ouais, it is him.

269
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,300
Insolents!

270
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,399
What does it make?

271
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,660
They was alarming!

272
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,090
How dare you to say such things of the world leader of naval construction.

273
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,469
What does it occur?

274
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,859
Kalifa is irritated easily these times!

275
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,669
I would like to be struck, too.

276
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,790
Excuse me…
I inopportunely lost my calm.

277
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,460
But Iceberg-san is an idol for the citizens, try not to be also impolite more.

278
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,800
Do not put Kalifa in anger…

279
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,840
When this woman is in anger…

280
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,080
She is rather awkward.

281
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,609
You put to him full with kicks!

282
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,190
It is you the impolite one!

283
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,730
But in any event, you, isn't this is Iceberg-san?

284
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,929
Look at that. It is a lettre de recommandation.

285
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,200
Of the Kokoro old woman…

286
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,350
“Repair their boat”, it says to me…

287
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,799
You will not do it?

288
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,639
Please repair our boat! We have sufficient money!

289
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,089
Going Merry is outside because navigation is impossible by here. Please, ossan.

290
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:31,479
Okay.

291
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,619
So slightly… it is really Okay?

292
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,339
Ouais.

293
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,200
Then why did you tear the letter?

294
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,970
Of lipstick I did not like the mark.

295
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,959
The Kokoro old woman is a friend with whom I drink a blow from time to time.

296
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,459
Hmm… if not, Kaku already left to examine your boat.

297
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,250
Let us wait until that occurs quietly.

298
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,029
In any event, it is one day tedious.
Do you want to make a visit of the building sites?

299
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,650
Ooooh, really?!

300
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,980
Please it is by here.

301
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,759
Is this a behavior of man who cancels his work?

302
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,350
Yosh, let us visit the shipyard!

303
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,410
They is good, the money…

304
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,730
Money…

305
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,960
What is what does not go, Usopp?

306
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,270
The money… the money disappeared!

307
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,230
Look at better!

308
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,330
It is not there.

309
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,440
It is there!

310
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,739
Oi, you are who, band of bastards!

311
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,259
Why you steal the money of the others?!

312
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,370
Wait, enfoiréééés!

313
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,330
Thank you, my guy!

314
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:33,490

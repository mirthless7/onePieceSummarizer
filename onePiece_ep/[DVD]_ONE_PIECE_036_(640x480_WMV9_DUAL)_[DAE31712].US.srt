1
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,730
We're not gonna abandon Bellemere!

2
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,650
Damn, why does this have to happen?
Don't give in to them, Bellemere!

3
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,560
Delicious! Truly a Bellemere orange sauce original!

4
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,150
The duck in the oven needs another 10 minutes, gotta add the vegatables

5
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,590
Stew's about ready too. So it's just the egg rice left.

6
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,460
This is going to hit the budget pretty hard.

7
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,020
Oh, they're home now?

8
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,820
SURVIVE!
BELLEMERE, THE MOTHER, AND NAMI'S FAMILY!

9
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:39,950
SURVIVE!
BELLEMERE, THE MOTHER, AND NAMI'S FAMILY!

10
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,670
It's open! Come in!

11
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,970
Don't mind if I do...

12
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,010
Don't mind if I do...

13
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,580
Too bad for you, I'm a former marine.

14
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,750
Too bad for you, I'm a former marine.

15
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,080
Too bad for you, I'm a former marine.

16
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,210
Too bad for you, I'm a former marine.

17
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,010
Now what would a pirate all the way from the
Grand Line want with Cocoyashi village?

18
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,260
What's so funny?!

19
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,550
Useless!

20
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,070
You inferior being that was absolutely useless!

21
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,690
You inferior being that was absolutely useless!

22
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,030
You inferior being that was absolutely useless!

23
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,240
You inferior being that was absolutely useless!

24
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,780
You inferior being that was absolutely useless!

25
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,490
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

26
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,330
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

27
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:10,580
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

28
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:10,910
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

29
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,160
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

30
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,410
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

31
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,620
We'll use the backdoor to let her escape!

32
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,820
But the pirates might be in there already!

33
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,690
It's okey

34
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,780
Stop !

35
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,650
Doctor!

36
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,800
You can't go home!

37
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,970
Get out of the way! We have
to rescue Bellemere-san!

38
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,970
Get out of the way! We have
to rescue Bellemere-san!

39
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,850
Nojiko , Nami !

40
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,540
You two listen up.

41
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,660
It's times like these... Well, because
of a situation like this,

42
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,790
I'm forced to tell you something
that may sound a little cruel.

43
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,140
Doctor !

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,820
Bellemere-san!!

45
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,620
It's no use... These guys are real monsters!

46
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,000
We're gonna get killed! Nojiko... Nami!

47
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,510
Bellemere!

48
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,590
Don't waste your life on something trivial.

49
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,670
Don't waste your life on something trivial.

50
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,840
Don't waste your life on something trivial.

51
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,130
There are fights without meaning, too!
This can be solved with money!

52
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,200
Gen-San !

53
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,260
That's right, marine girl.

54
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,770
Adults are 100,000. Kids are 50,000.

55
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,730
If you pay for the family's worth, I'll let
you live... As a divine mercy on you.

56
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,560
My family's worth?

57
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,490
That's 200,000 total.

58
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,450
How much do you have in all

59
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,160
Even with everything...

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,490
Even with everything...

61
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,910
A little over 100,000.

62
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,030
A little over 100,000.

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,920
Hey! There's food for three here!

64
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,090
Oh? A three-person family, eh?

65
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,420
It must've slipped my mind...

66
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,200
Today, me and a good friend of mine
were invited over for dinner.

67
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,080
Come to Bellemere, pay up for Your self, the food gonna get cold

68
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,250
Gen-San....

69
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,890
She seems to have the 100,000.

70
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,400
She seems to have the 100,000.

71
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,650
Good thing we all have enough.

72
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,030
Now everyone will be safe.

73
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,610
The census shows that she's never
been married nor had any kids.

74
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:10,820
She's always been single.

75
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,780
She's always been single.

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
Understand?

77
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,670
There's no proof that you two
and Bellemere are a family.

78
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,750
Leave this island before they find out!

79
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,630
Cross the sea and escape!

80
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:26,670
There's no other way we can afford
to save all three of you.

81
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,290
There's no other way we can afford
to save all three of you.

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,140
I know it's unreasonable for you two
youngsters to venture the sea.

83
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,100
Something could go wrong...

84
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,470
But even if there's the slightest chance...

85
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,180
No.
But even if there's the slightest chance...

86
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,020
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

87
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,310
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

88
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:39,890
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

89
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,150
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

90
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,350
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

91
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,690
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

92
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:41,940
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

93
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,810
I don't want to! Why do we have to leave?

94
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,440
They're the ones who invaded us.

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,820
I want to stay in this village.

96
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,700
Is it because we're poor, that we can't
be Bellemere-san's daughters?

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,040
Why...? Why does it have to be this way?

98
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,210
Thank god. That I could save...

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,220
Fine, we'll leave this island.

100
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,250
Nojiko!
Fine, we'll leave this island.

101
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,720
We're leaving! That way, Bellemere-san will be safe.

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,840
We're leaving! That way, Bellemere-san will be safe.

103
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,860
Hold up! Who said that was my share?

104
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,740
That 100,000 is for my two daughters.

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,990
I'm short on mine.

106
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,600
Bellemere, You....

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,660
Sorry, Gen-san.
Bellemere, You....

108
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,630
I can't deny I don't have a family...

109
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,590
Even if it means sacrificing my life.

110
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,130
That's absurd!

111
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,550
We may not be blood-related,

112
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,930
We may not be blood-related,

113
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,270
but we're still a family.

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,850
I wish I could be a mother by simply saying it.

115
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:58,930
I wish I could be a mother by simply saying it.

116
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:00,810
Those two... are my daughters, right?

117
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,980
Those two... are my daughters, right?

118
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,440
Those two... are my daughters, right?

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,210
Bellemere-san!!

120
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,200
Hay, You two...
Bellemere-san!!

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,810
Bellemere-san!!

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,190
If i was to be adopted, then I'd rather have been taken in By a rich family

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,110
I was lying!!

124
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,610
It was a lie!! Bellemere-san!

125
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:13,950
It was a lie!! Bellemere-san!

126
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,410
It was a lie!! Bellemere-san!

127
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,720
I really wanted to buy you more stuff,
like books and new clothes.

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,220
I really wanted to buy you more stuff,
like books and new clothes.

129
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,070
I'm sorry that I couldn't more
of a mother to you guys.

130
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,220
thats not true !

131
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,180
We don't want anything, just don't die!

132
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,600
Just stay with us!

133
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,030
You need to see the map I'm
gonna draw of the world!

134
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,740
Map, that's right...

135
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,780
Make sure you fulfill your dreams.

136
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,910
Live on' eh?

137
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,160
Bellemere-san!!

138
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,040
These are your daughters, eh?

139
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,230
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,460
You have to promise to leave these girls alone.

141
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,260
You have to promise to leave these girls alone.

142
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,340
You have to promise to leave these girls alone.

143
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,720
Of course! As long as you die.

144
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,870
Help !!

145
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,820
Eh... they've become bloodthirsty.

146
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,740
Don't kill them. Just show them what we're made of.

147
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,110
Don't kill them. Just show them what we're made of.

148
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,070
You'll set a perfect example.

149
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,280
You'll set a perfect example.

150
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,370
You'll die for your pathetic love.

151
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,120
You'll die for your pathetic love.

152
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,370
You'll die for your pathetic love.

153
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,130
Nojiko, Nami!

154
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,350
I love you.

155
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,000
You are helpless, you little fox

156
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,860
Let go of me! I'll pay next time...

157
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,420
with My Body!

158
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,280
You made another Boy cry?

159
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,770
Coz they made me mad

160
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,430
Its Ok, Its just a child's fight

161
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,360
They said Bellemeres Orange taste bad!

162
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,260
what did you say?!

163
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,350
Bellemere?

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,660
Don't lose to anyone.

165
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,260
Girls have to be strong too.

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
It doesn't matter if you're not complimented.

167
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,230
Don't hate the era you were born into.

168
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,600
And always remember the strength
to continue laughing.

169
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,820
BELLEMERE-SAN!!

170
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,870
During my reign, people who
don't have money will die!

171
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,740
Do you inferiors understand?

172
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,020
What's this?

173
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,670
A map?

174
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,840
Stop!
A map?

175
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,300
That's a special map that I drew! Give that back!

176
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,880
You drew this?

177
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,060
Give it back!

178
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,950
Stop it Nami!
Give it back!

179
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,480
Oh, this is rather good.

180
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,850
She could be useful, bring her with us.

181
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,140
Yes, capt'

182
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
Stop! Let go, let go of me! I don't wanna go!

183
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Let go of Nami! Let her go!

184
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,750
Let go of Nami! Let her go!

185
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,990
Wait! You got your money!

186
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,700
Wait! You got your money!

187
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,530
Wasn't the deal to leave them alone?

188
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah, we won't hurt her. We're
just gonna ''borrow'' her.

189
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,950
Gen-san, help me!

190
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,000
Don't you dare hurt those children!

191
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,870
Kuroobi.

192
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,630
Gen-san!

193
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,820
Gen-san!

194
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,960
Gen-san!!

195
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,260
Gen-san!!!

196
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,140
I'll save you, Nami...

197
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,390
I won't let you go.

198
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,570
It's okay! Enough already! You don't
have to save me, please just-!

199
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,440
Stubborn fool.

200
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,780
I'll save you...

201
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,570
I don't want anyone else to die!

202
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,160
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

203
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,290
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

204
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,930
All the village's ships have been sunk.

205
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,860
Our plan of letting Nojiko and Nami go to sea was...

206
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,100
Naive.

207
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,360
The marines won't even bother with us.

208
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,570
This island will be taken over.

209
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
Bellemere knew...

210
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,870
From her experience as a marine, she knew
instinctively what they would do.

211
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,540
There was no way anyone could escape this fate.

212
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,210
They've taken Nami.

213
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,970
What am I supposed to do now?

214
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,010
Bellemere-san.

215
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,560
We know where Arlong and his gang are!

216
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,980
Looks like they're gonna settle down on this island!

217
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,940
It's time to decide!

218
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,770
Whether we fight to our death,

219
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,070
or gamble our lives and wait for the
day the government saves us.

220
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,360
Knowing that we may die at any moment!

221
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,740
Knowing that we may die at any moment!

222
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,990
One of these two!

223
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,740
The only ones that can stand up to them are those
people from the ''Marine Headquarters''.

224
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,040
But the Headquarters have their
hands full with the Grand Line.

225
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,670
Chances of them coming out here
to save us are close to zero.

226
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,420
But I can't just ignore Nami.

227
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,420
Let us fight!

228
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,870
Im in too!

229
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,550
I can't abandon a child and think of my own survival.

230
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,520
We're all a family!

231
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,890
Even if we trade blows with them,
we're gonna save Na-chan!

232
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,770
Bellemere traded her life to save those girls!

233
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,650
Bellemere traded her life to save those girls!

234
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,020
We'll fight again!

235
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,110
Even if only one of us fought, we'd
all still get blamed anyway!

236
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,070
Yeah! Let's go! Fight!

237
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,860
as long as you continue living, lots of good things will come your way

238
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,250
Nami!

239
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:42,810
Nami!

240
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,570
Na-chan!

241
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,710
You're okay!

242
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,460
Nami! Nami!

243
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,600
Are you hurt? Did they make you cry?

244
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,490
Nami ?

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,100
I'm... joining...

246
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:57,930
Huh?

247
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,770
I'm... gonna join Arlong's crew.

248
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,450
I'm gonna be a map-drawer
and draw maps for them!

249
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,420
What are you talking about, Nami?

250
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,450
Are you for real?

251
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,710
Did they make you do this?

252
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,960
That's what happened right?

253
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,380
No

254
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,550
They threatened you to, right?

255
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,460
NO!!
They threatened you to, right?

256
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,210
Tell the truth!

257
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,090
Let go of me

258
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,430
Nami!

259
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,740
Nami!

260
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,100
T-That's Arlong's tattoo!

261
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,980
Nami!

262
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,930
You !

263
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,730
Look at this! I got all this money!

264
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,200
They're gonna buy me whatever I want!

265
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,180
Nami!

266
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,600
I won't forgive you, I won't!

267
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,720
You're becoming a pirate? I'll never forgive you!

268
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,860
Do you even know who they are?

269
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,610
So what?!

270
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,060
If you live properly and die like Bellemere-san did,

271
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,360
then I don't wanna live properly!

272
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,810
What a thing to say...

273
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,270
Bellemere-san...

274
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,230
Bellemere-san was killed for us!

275
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,980
That's enough, Nojiko.

276
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,770
Listen to me, Nami!

277
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,240
Never step foot in this village ever again!

278
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,160
Nami!

279
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,840
Such a foolish thing to have done...

280
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,260
Wasn't Bellemere like a mother to her?

281
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,300
That wasn't the case.

282
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,530
Nami loved Bellemere-san.

283
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,000
Hey, didn't Bellemere-san always say...

284
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,140
''As long as you continue living, good
things will come your way.''

285
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,450
" lots of good things.''

286
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,050
Yes...

287
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,930
After being captured by Arlong,

288
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,350
I saw him sink five marine ships easily.

289
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,810
The government probably won't
help this island anymore.

290
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,310
I realized that I had to act on my own.

291
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,860
made a deal with Arlong.

292
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,650
I'm going to buy Cocoyashi Village from him.

293
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,980
Buy the village ?

294
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,820
For 100 million beli.

295
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,990
If I buy the town, we'll be free.

296
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,580
No one has to die.

297
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,290
As long as I join that crew and make maps for them.

298
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,380
But 100 million beli.

299
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,250
Even if you worked your entire life for it...

300
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:12,500
Even if you worked your entire life for it...

301
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,260
I'll make it! No matter how!

302
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,640
Everyone's having a hard enough
time just paying the tribute.

303
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,430
I have to do this alone.

304
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,310
I ask for their help, they'll just get hurt.

305
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,070
Won't it be hard?

306
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
To be with the person who killed Bellemere-san,

307
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Won't it be hard?

308
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,330
I'm fine. I'll just smile whenever I see his face.

309
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,250
I've decided I'll never cry again.

310
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,580
I've decided I'm gonna fight on my own!

311
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,190
For a 10 year old girl to decide to fight
alone and struggle

312
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,780
Do you understand how hard it must've been?

313
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,410
For a deal that would free the village.

314
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,700
That girl...

315
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,830
Whoever makes Nami san suffer I'm gonna..!

316
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,380
Why...one sama..?

317
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,550
Because, I'm telling you not to interfere.

318
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,560
If you guys keep claiming that you're her partners,

319
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,720
the pirates are gonna doubt her loyalty.

320
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,180
And all her hard work these eight
years will be all for naught!

321
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,100
Don't make it any harder than it already is.

322
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,060
She is fighting on her own.

323
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,540
Knowing there are people who call her a
''friend'' is the most painful thing for her.

324
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,370
Stop! Stop it right there!

325
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,990
A Pirate Thief!?

326
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,330
That's right!

327
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,040
I'm gonna make use of this era, where there
are plenty of pirates to steal from!

328
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,210
I'm gonna get them back!

329
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,460
Aren't those cuts all over you?

330
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,810
Yeah, I screwed up a little.

331
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,850
But look at this, 1 million beli!

332
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,600
Who cares about that! We gotta tend to those cuts!

333
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,230
Who cares about that! We gotta tend to those cuts!

334
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,250
It's nothing, these cuts are nothing!

335
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,470
No one will find it here.

336
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,080
I'll save up little by little.

337
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,030
By the time this fills up, I'll have 100 million beli!

338
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,850
By the time this fills up, I'll have 100 million beli!

339
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,410
Still a long way to go.

340
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,400
100 million beli...

341
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,460
It took me a while, but it's only 7 million to go.

342
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,210
With my skills now, I can earn
that much in just a single trip.

343
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,720
Only one more trip and everything will be all over.

344
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,930
Everyone in Cocoyashi Village including me...

345
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,690
We'll be free from Arlong's reign. Then...

346
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,190
Then I can finally...

347
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,370
I can finally laugh from the bottom of my heart.

348
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,320
Bellemere-san...

349
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,630
What business do the marines have with Nami?

350
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,010
You should remain quiet and escort us.

351
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,430
Why does he have a pinwheel on his head?

352
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,520
That's TOO cool!

353
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,820
One final stealing spree... Shall I get on with it?

354
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,080
Marines?

355
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,660
And why is Gen-san with them?

356
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,840
Are you the female thief Nami?

357
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,870
you seem to have stashed the stolen
treasure in this very orange farm.

358
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,560
According to our investigations,

359
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,390
you seem to have stashed the stolen
treasure in this very orange farm.

360
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,060
Well, since you stole from pirates, we
have no intention of arresting you.

361
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,400
But theft is still theft.

362
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,480
Therefore all the treasure that you have stolen

363
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,280
will now become government property!

364
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,530
Now then hand it all over!

365
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,830
Confiscate it!

1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:05,250
1,867! 1,868! 1,869!

21
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,700
I got one!

22
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,760
Look it!

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,460
Nice!

24
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,730
Ah, I got one too!

25
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,200
It's a big one!

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,650
He's probably the big boss in these waters!

27
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,040
Really?

28
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,590
Whoa, cool!

29
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,070
GOT IT!

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,220
The big boss?

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,750
You can't even eat that.

32
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,950
Shut up!

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,040
Don't start dissing me when you haven't caught anything!

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,250
Yeah? Just watch me!

35
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,590
I'm gonna catch a huge one!

36
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,330
Will you really?

37
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,610
It'll work out somehow.

38
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,640
Nami-swan~! 

39
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,870
To enhance stunning beauty such as yours with silky smooth skin, I have brought you a special tropical juice!

40
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,990
Thank you.

41
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,840
Hey now!

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,410
Give me some too!

43
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,790
Silky smooth!

44
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,440
Hold on... Why would guys want silky smooth skin?

45
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,990
So we'll be cute.

46
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,240
Winds are steady. Currents are favorable.

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,790
Looks like it's going to be another great day!

48
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,540
Got one!

49
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,170
What the hell is that?

50
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,840
It's huge!

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,860
Oi, Luffy!

52
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,660
What'd you reel in this time?

53
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:16,630
The navigator's mutiny!
For an unwavering dream!

54
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,890
That's a huge turban shell!

55
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,540
I don't believe that's a turban shell.

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,910
What do we do with this?

57
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,440
Think we can eat it?

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,970
Eat it!?

59
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,400
Maybe I could grill it in its shell...

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,670
You too!?

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,410
Ah, I thought I was about to die!

62
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,410
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

63
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,420
Who... are you?

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,410
Oh, forgive my rudeness!

66
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,150
My name is Rice-Rice from Den Den Mushi Mail Order Services!

67
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,410
GEKIYASU - Super Deal!

68
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,050
Delighted to meet you.

69
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,210
Den Den Mushi Mail Order Service?

70
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,290
What the hell is that?

71
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,130
Oh!

72
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,800
While I was delivering some merchandise in my Escargot, I suddenly found myself amidst a storm!

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,900
It tossed me around quite viciously! This way! That way!

74
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,110
And before I knew it I was lost at sea!

75
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,600
Lost at sea?

76
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,960
"Sounan desu ka" - double meaning of "Lost at sea?" and "Is that so?"

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes I was.

78
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,350
Oh my! That was a nice tsukkomi, Miss!

79
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,350
Tsukkomi - comedy exchange

80
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,290
Have, have some water.

81
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,180
I can't thank you enough for saving my life!

82
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,960
As a token of my appreciation, please take these catalogs.

83
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,990
Anything you desire will be delivered with a single call!

84
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,540
Hey, that's pretty convenient.

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,750
So you deliver all the way out at sea?

86
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,420
Actually we don't.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,260
Oh...

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,890
I see...

89
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:54,170
Yes. Our motto is "Safety and low prices are our top priority".

90
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,760
And our company policy...

91
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,630
It's pretty spacious inside.

92
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,650
Ahh! What are you doing!?

93
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,030
Very well, allow me to introduce this fine product to you!

94
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,010
This is the well-known Buru-Buru Blade.

95
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,650
The Buru-Buru Blade happens to be our company's top product!

96
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,470
And this one I have with me today is the very newest model!

97
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,550
I gather many of you must already own the older version of the Buru-Buru Blade.

98
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,730
But that older model was not nearly as customizable.

99
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,060
It was just no good!

100
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,650
People were saying that it was fine for the elderly, but it was a little too dangerous for little children.

101
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,560
I don't really understand, but it sounds fun!

102
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:42,540
This newer model keeps going buru-buru-buru at a steady rhythm, and...

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,540
This is fun!

104
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,440
And this, I'm sure you all know, is the Ab-Ab Slider!

105
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,260
Our company's NUMBER ONE product!

106
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,820
It has returned, newer and better than before!

107
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,820
What's the difference between being the top and being number one?

108
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,970
Who knows.

109
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,110
And this is our best-selling product, the Golden Fish!

110
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,030
It's perfect for people who haven't been getting enough exercise.

111
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,790
And of these dieting products you've seen are available as a set!

112
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,360
And today only, I'll throw in 20 cartons of the famous West Blue ultra-sweet Mero-Mero Juice!

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,990
PLUS! A 26-volume encyclopedia which will surely come in handy!

114
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,340
And a handy pair of binoculars.

115
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,990
How much is all this, you ask?

116
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,320
You might think it would cost a fortune, but have no fear!

117
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,620
To show my gratitude for saving my life...

118
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,720
You're giving them to us!?

119
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,940
Just take it, you thieves! How does 23,800 beri sound?

120
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,620
You're selling it?

121
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,690
I WANT IT ALL!

122
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,050
You're buying it?

123
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,970
Oh, you have kitchen knives too?

124
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,050
Yes, you must mean these!

125
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,830
Each one was forged meticulously by the craftsmen of High Mountain!

126
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,740
Look at its flexibility! Its superior sharpness will last a lifetime!

127
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,350
A dozen of these table knives,

128
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,590
And I'll throw in the all-purpose, all-cutting kitchen scissors, a peeling knife, and an electric sharpener!

129
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,810
All together, it's 2,980 beri.

130
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,480
For you, Miss, I have this Silky Smooth Skin Soap to make your skin silky smooth!

131
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,790
You will become as silky smooth as an egg!

132
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,820
Oh, you seem to have everything.

133
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,760
Yes, there is nothing we don't have! From mineral water to cannonballs!

134
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,090
Do you have food?

135
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,930
No, we do not.

136
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,750
What, you don't?

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,090
We have nothing of what we don't have!

138
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,070
Hey, do you have any paper?

139
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,970
Paper?

140
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,620
Yeah.

141
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,990
Large, flexible, durable paper that won't get damaged by a little sea breeze.

142
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,710
If that is all, just leave it to us!

143
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,850
We, the Den Den Mushi Mail Order present our ulimate Thousand-Year Paper!

144
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,260
Thousand-Year Paper?

145
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,490
Thousand-Year Paper is made from the Thousand-Year Trees which grow on Eight Nine Island.

146
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,650
It does not attract bugs, and if left out in the sun, it is said that it will not fade for a thousand years!

147
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,400
It's perfect for documenting your family tree or for making treasure maps!

148
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,930
Paper airplanes too?

149
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,810
What?

150
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,510
That would be wasting it...

151
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,790
How much is it?

152
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,710
You're gonna buy it?

153
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,740
Of course!

154
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,950
I'm detecting the urge to buy!

155
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,610
I can sense she's willing to buy it at any price!

156
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,280
Therefore, I should offer her the highest possible price!

157
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,770
Even if you wish to purchase it, this is a very rare item.

158
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:37,060
If you place an order now, it might be five- no, ten years before you can actually receive it.

159
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,640
Do you think you could sell those to me?

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,620
Just name the price.

161
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,560
What!?

162
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,410
Nami, who loves counting money more than eating!?

163
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,190
Nami, the money-fiend!?

164
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,080
WILLING TO PAY ANY PRICE!?

165
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,930
That's going overboard, you guys.

166
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,750
Well, since you want it that badly...

167
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,320
A thousand-sheet set of the Thousand Year Paper.

168
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,630
Normally it sells for 60,000,000 beri, but I will offer it to you for the special low price of 48,000,000 beri!

169
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,310
48,000,000 beri!?

170
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,200
That means each sheet is 48,000 beri!

171
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,610
Can't you make it any cheaper?

172
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,080
You're killing me here. How about 47,500,000 beri?

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,340
2,000,000 beri!

174
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,110
4,800,000 beri!

175
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,040
Sounds fishy.

176
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,150
Down a little more?

177
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,920
I'll buy it!

178
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,130
Sanji-kun...

179
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,750
Do you have the money?

180
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,330
Nope.

181
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,770
If you hand this guy over to the Marines, you'll have plenty of change to spare.

182
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,620
WHAAAT!?

183
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,440
Forgive me, Luffy.

184
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,760
This is for Nami-san.

185
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,210
WAIT A SECOND!

186
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,880
Luffy?

187
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,160
Luffy!? You mean Monkey D. Luffy?

188
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,590
Yeah, that's me.

189
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,440
Sanji.

190
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,010
Come on and untie me!

191
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,030
Nope.

192
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,280
Monkey D. Luffy, a bounty of 100,000,000 beri... Leader of a bloodthirsty pirate crew...

193
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,230
Now that you mention it... That's a pirate flag!

194
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,510
How could I have overlooked such an important thing!?

195
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,950
Untie me already!

196
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,420
I said no.

197
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,750
I've just remembered a very important engagement. Please excuse me!

198
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,020
Thank you for your time!

199
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,330
Oi, you forgot your...

200
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,270
What's with him?

201
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,910
He was probably afraid of you.

202
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,080
The wanted man, Monkey D. Luffy.

203
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,340
Got it?

204
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,550
I'm going to do some work, and I don't want you guys bothering me.

205
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,710
What kind of work are you doing?

206
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
It's a secret! 

207
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,900
That's not the least bit cute.

208
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,320
Leave it to me!

209
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,200
I won't let anyone near while you're working, Nami-san!

210
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,130
But what if the wind suddenly changes?

211
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,290
It'll be alright.

212
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,540
Those clouds...

213
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,040
As long as those clouds don't move, the weather will be fine all day.

214
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,270
Call me if you see those clounds change at all.

215
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,930
Now then...

216
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,170
Ever since we entered the Grand Line, things have been so busy that I haven't had much free time.

217
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,340
Little Garden.

218
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,170
Drum Island.

219
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,380
Arabasta.

220
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,390
I've managed to map out the entire route we've traveled.

221
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,710
And there's also the local maps I stole- er, I mean got from the towns we stopped at.

222
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,980
It's time to start drawing it.

223
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,900
The dream I've had since I was a kid!

224
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,260
My own map of the world!

225
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,430
Hey guys!

226
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,800
Let's clean this place up a bit while Nami-san's working.

227
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,350
Aye-aye!

228
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,260
Work hard!

229
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,230
YOU'RE WORKING TOO!

230
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,260
Cheater!

231
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,180
That's no fair, slacking off by yourself!

232
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,780
Yeah, yeah!

233
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,330
Then what about her?

234
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,520
Don't be an idiot.

235
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,480
She's a lady.

236
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,780
That's stupid!

237
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,660
What's the difference between being a man or a woman?

238
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,600
Just help out , you monster Marimo.

239
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,360
That's funny coming from you, you love-love machine demon!

240
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,820
Just help out or I'll kick your ass!

241
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,360
Why don't you try it? Think you can beat a monster?

242
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,020
You only talk like that 'cause you haven't witnessed my demonic powers.

243
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,310
I'll cut you to pieces!

244
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,550
You're askin' to be filleted!

245
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,010
I'll mince you first!

246
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,210
Yeah! Yeah! Go! Go!

247
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,910
Come on, stop it guys!

248
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,850
Usopp! Don't just stand there! Stop them!

249
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,110
Are you kidding?

250
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,400
What am I gonna do?

251
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,590
Nothing can stop those two.

252
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,510
Oh.

253
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,400
Comin' right up!

254
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,540
Didn't I tell you to be quiet!?

255
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,290
Mellorine...

256
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,430
A-A single blow!

257
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,930
Damn, that hurt...

258
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,620
Bellemere-san!

259
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,550
Bellemere-san, listen!

260
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,990
Bellemere-san? I wanna know where the wind blows from.

261
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,220
From the sea.

262
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,180
The sea?

263
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,070
Yup.

264
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,300
The wind is born from the sea and blows over Kokoyashi Village, bringing us blessings.

265
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,720
And it's not just the wind.

266
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,740
Rain, clouds, and rainbows all come from the sea.

267
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,950
Oh!

268
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,560
Then... where does the sea come from?

269
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,480
Nami! Don't bother Bellemere-san so much!

270
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,380
But, Nojiko!

271
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,390
Nami, you really are a curious one.

272
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,260
Nami!

273
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,340
Nami!

274
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,700
I heard you did it again.

275
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,140
The bookstore lady came barking at me.

276
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,710
Okay, let's go home.

277
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,230
Dinner's ready.

278
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,970
Hey, Bellemere-san...

279
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,610
What's beyond that sea?

280
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,080
Who knows?

281
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,030
I don't know a thing about what lies beyond the Grand Line.

282
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,760
Even though you were a Marine?

283
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,120
I was, but the sea is just too big.

284
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,640
I want to see what lies beyond the sea.

285
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
Nami...

286
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,170
Do you think I can make it?

287
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,960
Beyond the sea?

288
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,100
You're a strong girl, Nami.

289
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,010
If you set your mind to it, you'll be able to go anywhere you want.

290
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,400
Then I've decided!

291
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm going to travel the world's seas with my navigation skills!

292
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,490
And I'll make a world map of everything I see!

293
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,880
I'll do it!

294
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,040
Yes.

295
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,420
Someday... I will complete a map of the world.

296
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,900
Hey, Luffy!

297
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,580
Watch this!

298
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,120
Wow!

299
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,430
That's so cool!

300
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,790
Geez!

301
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,610
You must be tired. Have you finished your work?

302
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,650
No...

303
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,060
What's all this?

304
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,580
Oi, what are you guys doing?

305
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,710
Cleaning.

306
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,120
It's kinda fun.

307
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,390
Wanna try it out, Nami?

308
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,730
What's all the noise?

309
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,710
What? The Silky Smooth Skin Soap?

310
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,590
Hey, that's dangerous!

311
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,640
Don't worry! We're fine!

312
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,080
Luffy!

313
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,200
That idiot!

314
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,130
GOMU GOMU NO...

315
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,720
BUNGEE!

316
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,660
Look out!

317
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,030
Nami-san, look out!

318
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,240
Are you alright, Nami-san?

319
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,840
My map!

320
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh, you were drawing maps?

321
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,060
What? A map?

322
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,390
So that's what you were up to?

323
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,700
That's right.

324
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,820
It is a one of a kind map recording our travels on the Grand Line.

325
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,110
That's all I wanted!

326
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,280
My dream is to complete my own map of the world.

327
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,600
Get out!

328
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,760
But...

329
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,670
Just...

330
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,280
Nami!

331
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,740
What?

332
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,510
Sorry.

333
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,950
If sorry was all it took, the Marines wouldn't be after us!

334
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,140
Just get out!

335
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,340
If you don't leave, I'll fine you 100,000 beri!

336
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,550
It's your fault.

337
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,870
Why me?

338
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,700
Geez, they'll just be in my way if they stay in here.

339
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,590
Luffy, cheer up!

340
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,180
Why do I smell rain?

341
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,950
This is bad!

342
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,930
Luffy!

343
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,830
Luffy!

344
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,720
We've got trouble! The clouds...!

345
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,460
Oh, a spider has ten legs.

346
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,460
Kumo can mean either cloud or spider

347
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,980
No, they have eight.

348
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,580
Wait, that's not the point! Wake up!

349
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,860
A hundred arms...

350
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,860
Usopp!

351
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,850
Sanji, wake up!

352
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,970
Zoro!

353
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,780
Flower lady!

354
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,770
Help!

355
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,440
Nami!

356
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,180
I'll fine you 100,000 beri!

357
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,060
W-What should I do?

358
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,340
It's done!

359
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,780
Humm, Prefect!

360
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,470
Am I a genius or what?

361
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,980
What was that?

362
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,960
Hey, what's going on!?

363
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,040
Nami!

364
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,480
Hey, what are you doing?

365
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,670
Why didn't you tell me about this!?

366
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,400
But, the 100,000 beri fine...

367
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,380
Don't be stupid.

368
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,720
Hey, you guys!

369
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,370
How long do you plan on sleeping?

370
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,000
Wow, what the hell is that?

371
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,970
IT'S A CYCLONE!

372
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,750
We can tell.

373
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,530
IT'S A CYCLONE!

374
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:21,980
I said...!

375
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,590
Luffy, Zoro! Hoist the sails!

376
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,610
Aye!

377
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,890
Usopp, Chopper! Tie down everything on deck with the ropes!

378
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,950
Got it!

379
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,610
Sanji-kun, hard to starboard!

380
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,050
Turn the bow away from the cyclone. Or else we'll be pulled in!

381
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
Oi, oi.

382
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,200
Listen up!

383
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,960
If that map I worked so hard on falls victim to the high waves...

384
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,700
Not one of you...

385
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,120
...will escape.

386
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,500
She really is scary!

387
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,900
Atmospheric pressure rising, rain's stopped...

388
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,220
Nice work!

389
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,730
You can all take a rest now!

390
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,080
Oh.

391
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,830
I'm going to continue with my maps, so keep watching the clouds, okay?

392
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,540
You're still working on it?

393
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,360
Of course! My goal is to draw a map of the world.

394
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,110
I've only finished my first page. The real task is still ahead.

395
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,460
Impressive resolve you've got.

396
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,350
I love this Nami-san too~! 

397
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,310
You think there's gonna be a 100,000 beri fine again?

398
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,350
Yeah.

399
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,590
Have you been reading the whole time?

400
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,440
Okay, full sail!

401
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:48,610
Full speed ahead!

402
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,940
AYE!

403
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,500
So now, you guys have the helm.

404
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,800
Oi!

405
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:12,200
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

406
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,120
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

407
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,380
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

408
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,800
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

409
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,060
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

410
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,270
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

411
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,250
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

412
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,250
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

413
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,990
Let's paint a story of the future

414
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,240
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

415
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,290
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

416
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,290
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

417
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,250
A never ending journey to be together.

418
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,250
A never ending journey to be together.

419
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,460
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

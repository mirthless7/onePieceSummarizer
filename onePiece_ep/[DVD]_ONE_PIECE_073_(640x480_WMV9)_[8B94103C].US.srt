1
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:54,610
Tears of victorious Brogy!

2
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:54,610
The verdict of Elbaf

3
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,230
It is the signal.

4
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,500
It is quite today excited.

5
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,620
Where do you go?

6
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,740
Your wounds of the last meeting are not…

7
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,670
And then?

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,470
My adversary is in the same state.

9
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,890
There is no excuse to have in a combat without mercy.

10
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,710
It would be a blow to lose the face!

11
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,320
He! Wait, Ossan!

12
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,650
Where you go?

13
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,890
Do not move, Dorry-San!

14
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,200
You rest!

15
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,220
If you made too many efforts, you will die!

16
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,360
I am the Dorry Warrior.

17
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,310
And I will make in kind

18
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,650
that this combat does not tarnish the honor of Elbaf!

19
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,040
It is not true…

20
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,130
Ouahou! It manages to raise this enormous rock!

21
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,790
Luffy-San!

22
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,670
He! What you insane, Ossan?

23
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,000
Remove this rock of me!

24
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,460
He! Ossan! He!!

25
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,260
Nothing will stop to me now.

26
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,390
It is perhaps an old history which goes back to one century.

27
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,500
But once the combat started,

28
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,690
it should be finished.
And to give up it is

29
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,360
to give up being a warrior!

30
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,200
And if I am not any more one warrior,

31
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,490
I am nothing any more.

32
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,580
Afflicted to have suspected to you.

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,990
God of the War

34
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,670
Elbaf gave its verdict!

35
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,220
I lost his favors.

36
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,890
It is all.

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,600
Your God? To gain or lose its favors?

38
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,200
Ca has nothing to do with that!

39
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,450
If your God asked you to die, you would do it?

40
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,020
Your combat was sabotaged!

41
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,900
And a combat faked it is not any more one equitable duel!

42
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,150
You know that I am right!

43
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,120
Keep silent yourself!

44
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,370
How a man who lived only 10 or 20 years

45
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,130
can it include/understand the divine intentions of Elbaf?

46
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,670
I have anything of it to do that!

47
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,880
He! Release me of down there!

48
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,960
He, Ossan!

49
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,090
Giant-ossan!

50
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,020
He! Ossan!

51
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,680
Return, head of mule!

52
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,260
I will not let myself leave like that!

53
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,690
Put it at the carpet, Maître Brogy!

54
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,810
Courage!

55
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,210
No the problem, Usopp!

56
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,280
It will bite dust this time!

57
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,620
Ouais! Find it,

58
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,490
Warrior of Elbaf!

59
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,710
Ahead and fight!

60
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,160
You are the best!

61
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,980
You are incredible!

62
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,630
You are strongest!

63
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,670
You are tall!

64
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,420
You are very tall!

65
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,380
You are gigantic!!

66
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,630
They take this ridiculous combat with the serious one.

67
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,510
Do not say that it is ridiculous, shit!

68
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,680
Brogy is a proud warrior of the seas!
I want to become like him!

69
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,120
How can you say similar tricks?

70
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,980
It does not matter, turn over to the boat.

71
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,110
Which pitches to wait one year so that the Log is reloaded.

72
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,770
We must turn over to the boat and think together of a plan.

73
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,190
Not so quickly! Wait a little!

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,900
I am not size to face dinosaurs!

75
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,120
Moreover, it is impossible for us to cross this jungle alive!

76
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,370
What is it of your speech of proud warrior?

77
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,170
I spoke only about my intentions.

78
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,550
I want to become a man of honor!

79
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,840
Good, I do not have the choice.

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,090
Luffy and Vivi must be with other Géant.

81
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,340
It will be necessary for us to go until them.

82
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,680
Listen, Nami…

83
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,690
Even if a day comes where I must all lose,

84
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,000
even if I find myself taken in a combat with died on a deserted island,

85
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,560
it will be with pride that I will be able to shout:

86
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,360
“I am Usopp, the warlike valiant knight of the seas!!”

87
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,320
It is that, it is that…

88
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
Then hurries to become a proud warrior on whom I will be able to count.

89
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,280
Euh… ouais!

90
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,920
Dorry! Did my old man, you appreciate this glassful of beer?

91
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,880
Ouais.

92
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,760
It was divine.

93
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,800
You exaggerate a little there!

94
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,800
In guard!

95
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,400
What arrives to you, Dorry?

96
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,320
You lack guarantor!

97
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,320
Not, I am the same one as usually!

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,760
CA CANNOT SE PASS LIKE CA!

99
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,930
He!

100
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,440
Me which thought of having found a warrior valorous…

101
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,220
Luffy-San…

102
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,350
Why is it made of it as much for a Giant that he hardly knows?

103
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,440
It does not resemble these sanguinary pirates whose head is put at price…

104
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,360
It is which? Who wasted the duel of the Giants?

105
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,820
With the fact…

106
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,910
Where is Karu?

107
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,470
Oh! But it this would not be empoté of bird which is always with the Princess?

108
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,220
Ouais.

109
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,540
Not a gesture.

110
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,290
It is a pleasant chance to find you here.

111
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,630
There is something which one would like that you make.

112
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,130
Indeed.

113
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,940
Zut… I am lost.

114
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,650
I remember to have seen this tree.

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,780
It was not “on the left of the tree with lianas”?

116
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,530
It is Nami!

117
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,820
You at the right moments.

118
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,240
I am released a little there.

119
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,540
I do not know any more where to go…

120
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,210
But with do the fact, what you make here?

121
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,040
What you ace?

122
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,300
A DINOSAUR!!

123
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,010
Dino!

124
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,420
Dino!

125
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:16,720
Dino!

126
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,470
Dino!

127
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,640
YOU RUN TOO QUICKLY!!

128
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,180
This imbecile…

129
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,060
Luffy!

130
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,980
Fortunately!

131
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,940
Why be to you here?

132
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,370
Nami?

133
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,520
Nami!

134
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,140
Nami!

135
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,770
Nami?

136
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,980
Nami?

137
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,020
Oh shit.

138
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,950
NAMI!!

139
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,930
NAMI!!

140
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,590
Luffy!

141
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,010
Luffy!

142
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,430
Luffy!

143
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:42,800
Luffy!

144
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,260
Luffy!

145
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,640
Luffy!

146
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,010
LUFFY!!

147
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,810
They is dreadful!

148
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,860
Nami was puffed out by a dinosaur!!

149
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,820
REALLY?

150
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,820
One ran together through the jungle to escape a dinosaur,

151
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,110
when suddenly, it disappeared!!

152
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,940
What did I make?

153
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,080
I let it be made kill!!

154
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,370
Wait…

155
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,660
You calm!

156
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,170
The guy!

157
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,130
You said well that it had disappeared suddenly…

158
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,960
Then you did not check that it was made really devour, not truth?

159
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,300
GOOD BLOOD!

160
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,550
HOW I WOULD HAVE PU TO CHECK
Whereas I HAD DIED OF JITTER!

161
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,290
IF It IS NOT a DINOSAUR,
It IS ANOTHER WILD BEAST!

162
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,310
WHAT DOES CA CHANGE?

163
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,830
I am not sure, but…

164
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,360
Baroque Works perhaps followed us on this island.

165
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,960
And among you two, Nami-San was the only one of aiming.

166
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,020
Is Baroque Works here on this island?

167
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,220
But then…

168
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,870
Why I am not aimed too?

169
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,560
It is surely because you are not on the list of Works Baroque.

170
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,600
I see!

171
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,960
And it is similar for this beer,
it was reserved to us.

172
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,460
The beer?

173
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,340
It is what this beer history?

174
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,100
Brogy gave our beer to Dorry.

175
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,580
But when Dorry drank it, the beer exploded in its stomach.

176
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,290
WHAT?

177
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,340
Did the beer explode in its stomach?

178
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,130
And it left to the combat under these conditions?

179
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,510
I tried to stop it.

180
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,840
But it posed this foutu rock on me!

181
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,290
Not possible…

182
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,720
Here is a century that they

183
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,480
fight of all their force with equal footings!!

184
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,970
This battle must be the most honourable battle in the world!

185
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,540
Ouais…

186
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,460
How do they dare to intervene in their combat??

187
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,840
What arrives to you?

188
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,770
They continue to fight.

189
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,400
This Dorry Ogre blue tougher than is envisaged.

190
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,780
I should perhaps give a small nudge in the right direction.

191
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,100
It was

192
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,690
a long century of combat.

193
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,230
God of the War, Elbaf,
its verdict gave.

194
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,320
I lost his favors.

195
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,150
It is all.

196
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,030
Luffy!

197
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,330
Luffy-San!

198
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,910
It IS WHICH?

199
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:06,750
SHOW you!!

200
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,180
Mr. 3, I believe to have heard something.

201
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,060
How it is funny! It is perhaps the cry of overcome which resounds in the jungle!

202
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,810
73 thousand…

203
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,380
467 engagements…

204
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,900
73 thousand…

205
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,430
466 ties

206
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,640
and 1 victory!

207
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,750
It is the victory which makes you cry joy?

208
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,000
Like I envy you to be a unicellular being.

209
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,460
Lastly, I address my sincere congratulations nevertheless to you.

210
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,090
Tears of joy…

211
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,130
You could not include/understand.

212
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,260
And initially which are you?

213
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,510
I am Mr. 3, sorry to present to me under my code name.

214
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,430
I am a simple sculptor.

215
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,610
And here my assistant, a realistic painter, GoldenWeek Miss.

216
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,110
And to finish, you are now under my control.

217
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,820
What is it?

218
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,300
Well, Luffy!

219
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,100
I do not know whom did that,
but I will make him his festival!

220
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,720
I come too.

221
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,060
Ouais! They is cool which you come too!

222
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,810
I am reassured more.

223
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,140
It will not be necessary!

224
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,730
They was thus you!

225
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,080
It is returned to you.

226
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,620
One does not need any more now.

227
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Karu!

228
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,540
Why…

229
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,500
It is which these deux-là?

230
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,630
They were in the last city where stopover was made!

231
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,470
How did you dare?

232
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,590
Karu does not have anything to see in all that!

233
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,180
You are right. This bird does not have absolutely anything to see in all that.

234
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,410
But, one was wary of this man to the straw hat.

235
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,540
Then we thought that if one fesait to shout this bird,

236
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,900
you would come to his help in the jungle.

237
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,460
But this thing was more coriace that envisaged.

238
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,990
Go. Call your mistress.

239
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,790
Only an only great cry.
And one will let you leave.

240
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,620
It is like that?

241
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,140
One will make you shout!

242
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,550
Call the Princess.

243
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,680
You would do better…

244
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,970
TO CALL IT NOW!

245
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,730
Open your nozzle, cursed duck!

246
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,640
But now that we are here,

247
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,650
and that Straw hat is in the incapacity to move,

248
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,230
we do not need thus more this bird.

249
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,570
Karu…

250
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,910
Which stupid bird.

251
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,710
You…

252
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,790
Then it was you who put the bomb in our beer!

253
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,600
Hein?

254
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, ouais.

255
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,320
It is which that one?

256
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,420
It was on the list?

257
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,670
Not, but it forms apparently part of the band.

258
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,800
Let us eliminate it too.

259
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,010
It is you who sabotaged the duel of the Giants!

260
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,560
I go you botter the buttocks!

261
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,060
It is me which will eliminate you!

262
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,520
Oh? You want to face us, Miss Wednesday?

263
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,580
You think of being serious vis-a-vis two agents like us?

264
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,380
Take that!

265
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,750
They were had!

266
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,630
Wahou! What a explosion!

267
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,930
Poor small urchin…

268
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,340
Usopp!!

269
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,560
You calm!

270
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,890
It is not worthwhile to excite itself like that,

271
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,450
we will not kill you immediately.

272
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,120
One follows just the orders of Mr. 3.

273
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,450
Mr. 3?

274
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,210
Doru = the last part of “Kanudoru” (candle)

275
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,210
The man who ate the Fruit Doru Doru.

276
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,090
It is on this island?

277
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,380
Indeed.

278
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,970
It can create wax starting from its body
and to control it with its desire. A human candle.

279
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,060
A human candle?

1
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:37,880
Ace and Luffy!

2
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:37,880
Fraternal memories and bonds

3
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,680
With the kingdom of the Oases,

4
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,650
three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,820
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,630
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,600
After being arrived at Arabasta, Luffy and its crew…

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,010
… found themselves vis-a-vis Colonel Smoker.

9
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,450
But Luffy was saved just in time by…

10
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,390
… a man handling fire, Ace with the burning fists.

11
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,000
Ace is… the brother of Luffy.

12
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,330
Release.

13
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,850
Ca would astonish me.

14
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,890
Ace with the burning fists…

15
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,800
Who could have thought that somebody as would be to you the brother of Straw hat…

16
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,570
Is Qu- what it?

17
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,410
A fire!?

18
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,580
Not, it is not ordinary fire!

19
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,000
What can occur well?

20
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,300
A battle opposing fire and smoke?

21
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,610
He said to have eaten the fruit Mera Mera.

22
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,340
But is Luffy, it true?

23
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,410
Is this guy really your brother?

24
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:49,950
Ouais!

25
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,470
It is Ace!

26
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,920
I am not really surprised that you have a brother…

27
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,150
But what does it make on Grand Line?

28
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,610
Ace is a pirate.

29
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,610
It left our island three years before me, to launch out in the search of One Piece.

30
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,000
Of in any event, dispatch we to turn over to the boat.

31
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,880
One should leave this place before they launch out to our continuation.

32
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,040
You are right, Nami-San!

33
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,800
But I would never have thought that I would see Ace in a place like that one.

34
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,490
Eh, the road separates into two!

35
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,600
Usopp, on the left!

36
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,460
Included/understood everyone?

37
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,710
Yes! I am with you, whatever the way which you will take, Nami-San!

38
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,160
Ero - (Erotic):Pervert, Cook:Cook.

39
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,910
I have some enough of your remarks, Ero-Cook!

40
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,170
Brilliant!

41
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,440
The columns continue to grow!

42
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,090
A combat between fire and smoke is thus vain.

43
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,180
But you, isn't this knew it?

44
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,860
Where are the pirates of Straw hat?

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,750
They left!

46
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,030
And Ace too!

47
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,220
We lost sight of the fact them!

48
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,380
It is the first time that I catch up with Straw hat since I am on Grand Line.

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,760
Portgas D. Ace.

50
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,160
You become awkward.

51
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,370
Charge the provisions!

52
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,400
One from goes away now!

53
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,550
Let us dispatch!

54
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,460
VEIL DEPLIEE!

55
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,680
Eh, we finally arrived on your island.

56
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,650
You are sure that one should not remain here longer?

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,230
Yes, one stopped here just to get the provisions necessary.

58
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,690
One from now on will sail upstream of the river from here.

59
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,590
Then, one will put the course on Arabasta.

60
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,440
Our next stage is the Green City, Erumalu.

61
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,560
Erumalu?

62
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,440
Quickly!

63
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,370
Yes!

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,540
Do not slow down!

65
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,340
All is avoided!

66
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,560
It left!

67
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,900
But…

68
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,390
Hum!?

69
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,570
It is as… if we missed somebody.

70
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,450
It is what I think too.

71
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,300
And that which misses… is most important.

72
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,230
This… MORON!

73
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,000
It is odd…

74
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,830
Why am I only here?

75
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,510
Where are parties?

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,590
Eh well, you do not have the air of somebody who seeks to escape.

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,070
Yo!

78
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,440
Ace!

79
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,150
Ca made a long time, Luffy.

80
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,620
Yes, that made a lease, Ace.

81
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,340
Does Ca make how much years?

82
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,460
No idea.

83
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,160
But Luffy, you are to me always with the trace.

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,290
You did not change since you were a kid.

85
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,820
You either, Ace.

86
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,460
Ca has surprised me to see that you had eaten a fruit of the demon, but if not, you did not change.

87
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,740
You remember this time when you had stolen a hundred water melons to the farmer…

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,640
… and that you had spit the pips with the figure to him before fleeing!

89
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,780
It was not me!

90
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,950
It was you!

91
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,890
Same as you crowned one bump on the head!

92
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,030
It was you also, that!

93
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,600
I did not stop laughing.

94
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,310
One really did not change, both.

95
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,200
Ouais.

96
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,120
That good memories!

97
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,610
But…

98
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,150
Your crew is surely seeking you.

99
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,770
Ouais.

100
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,200
But, Ace…

101
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
What do you make here?

102
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,280
Hein?

103
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,400
What? You did not have my message with Drum?

104
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,540
In Drum?

105
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,030
Bah, drops.

106
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,120
It was not too important.

107
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,830
I have some small businesses to regulate here.

108
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,360
I thought that one could see oneself.

109
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,570
Small businesses?

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,230
I am with the Pirates of
White beard, now.

111
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,000
Pirates of White Beard?

112
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,610
It is the mark of the Pirates of White Beard.

113
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,890
My greater pride.

114
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,730
Luffy.

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,210
Does Ca say to you to join us?

116
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,890
Your crew is also welcome.

117
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,560
Not.

118
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,670
I was sure. It was by courtesy.

119
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,410
Barbe Blanche is the largest pirate whom I know.

120
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,300
I decided to help it to become the Lord of the Pirates.

121
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,370
I hope that you include/understand, Luffy.

122
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,230
And then? Ca will make me a person moreover fight.

123
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,320
I will become the Lord of the Pirates.

124
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,290
Eh, wood not all, Luffy!

125
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,790
He had to occur something downtown.

126
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,010
If not, all the soldiers would not have left their station…

127
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,900
Ca well will help me to escape to me.

128
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,110
Mr. 11.

129
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,670
To know my code name, you must work for Baroque Works.

130
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,200
You are “Million”?

131
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,930
Dispatch you to detach me!

132
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,170
One works well for Baroque Works, but…

133
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,650
One is “Billions”.

134
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,410
Ca wants to say that one is candidates to be of “Number Agents”.

135
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,590
Mr. 11.

136
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,670
An Agent of low level should not be much stronger than us.

137
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,750
Oh, I see.

138
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,560
I excuse myself, Billions.

139
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,380
Could you detach me before they return?

140
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,690
Would not be stupid.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,280
If you die, one of us will become perhaps “Number Agent”.

142
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,240
Let us release a place “Number Agent”.

143
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,850
NOT!

144
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,330
He!!!!

145
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,510
Ace with the burning fists is downtown!

146
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,220
What?

147
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,850
Ace with the burning fists?

148
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,080
The Commander of the Second Division of the Pirates of White Beard?

149
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,140
If we deal with him,

150
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,140
one will be ensured to be of “Number Agents”!

151
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,600
Let us seek your friends.

152
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,500
If the Navy finds them, that is likely to be dangerous.

153
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,030
They are perhaps turned over to the boat.

154
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,720
In which port it is moored?

155
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,750
I know anything the whole of it.

156
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,520
What does one make then?

157
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,540
When you are Captain of a pirate boat,

158
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,780
to know where is your boat is necessary.

159
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,660
It does not matter, does not worry you for that.

160
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,190
You exchanges not.

161
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,100
Say to me, your crew…

162
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,980
How is it?

163
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,540
A epeist who wants to become best world in his discipline.

164
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,750
Haramaki:Girdle protection

165
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,300
It always carries a haramaki.

166
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,140
Our navigatrice adores the charts, the tangerines and the money.

167
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,530
And our cook makes us super flat goods.

168
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,870
There is also a liar.

169
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,890
And… a reindeer!

170
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,190
Ca does not miss diversity in this team.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,650
In this moment, there is also a princess and a duck which has the mottled nozzle.

172
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,690
They are really incredible!

173
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,430
Me, I would bet that you are most incredible of all.

174
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,870
However,

175
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,400
that does not astonish me that you direct a small crew of pirates.

176
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,060
We miss just a musician.

177
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,940
Do not move any more, Ace with the burning fists.

178
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,020
As you can see it, you cannot escape.

179
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,730
Ace with the burning fists, your head is with us.

180
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,530
Prepare to die!

181
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,130
One should await Luffy before leaving, not?

182
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,080
The Navy soon will invade the port.

183
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,490
One must hide the boat some share.

184
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,570
There should be a split a little further in which we will be able to hide.

185
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,600
One will wait until the things are calmed.

186
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,460
We then will seek Luffy.

187
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,370
It is not true, it is necessary always that one runs to him afterwards.

188
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,030
You speak about a Captain…

189
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,470
Ace with the burning fists.

190
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,900
Your chance stops here.

191
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,140
Eh, you do not only believe…

192
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,960
this other type, it is… Straw hat, Luffy?

193
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,260
Now that you speak about it…

194
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,240
Its premium is of 30.000.000 Berrys!

195
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,430
One crowned one bowl, today!

196
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,660
Ace with the burning fists and Luffy with the straw hat!

197
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,030
When one has your heads, our chances to be promoted will be three times larger!

198
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,930
Let us leave to research your boat.

199
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,170
One should go to the beach.

200
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,650
Ouais.

201
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,630
Eh! You two!

202
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,330
You stop!

203
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,980
Us to take for imbeciles…!

204
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,670
KILL them!

205
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,200
OUAIS!

206
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,040
Jerk!

207
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,670
It is finished!

208
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,290
Exterminate it!

209
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,210
Come and test!

210
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,500
Attack it on all the sides!

211
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,200
Qu-Quoi?

212
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,530
Its arms lengthened!

213
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,680
He had to eat a fruit of the demon!

214
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,750
It is for you, band of dumbs!

215
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,300
Ca burns!

216
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,790
AL GO AHEAD!

217
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,240
The promotion of Number Agent is with us!

218
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,520
ALL ON THEM!

219
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,680
Ah, sea!

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,140
You see your boat?

221
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,350
You will not leave!

222
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,120
You donot can stop you.

223
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,240
Ah, it is over there!

224
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,090
Eh, I am there!

225
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,430
The guy!

226
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,420
Eh, Luffy. Go ahead…

227
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,680
He does not listen to me.

228
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,370
Ah, it is there!

229
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,520
It is Luffy!

230
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,810
I see it!

231
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,530
Be sure for you?

232
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,160
Ouais, it is well him.

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,550
With this air of moron…

234
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,200
Me… here!

235
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,800
Sanji-San! Tony-Kun!

236
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,350
And now…

237
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,600
There has enough.

238
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,440
Afflicted, Sanji, Chopper.

239
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,760
Jerk…!

240
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,970
You do not know your own force!?

241
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,680
I will throw you over edge!

242
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,450
It rightly! You caused us not badly problems!

243
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,970
Behave a little more like one captain.

244
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,500
Afflicted.

245
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,480
Ah I forgot Ace!

246
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,570
Ace?

247
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,150
Was your brother with you?

248
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,060
One should not await it?

249
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,410
Eh well, it will be well.

250
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,990
Ace is strong.

251
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,850
It is really strong?

252
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,740
Ouais, it was it already before eating the fruit Mera Mera.

253
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,440
I never gained when one fought!

254
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,790
Ace is really very strong.

255
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,750
You never gained? Against human normal?

256
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,460
The big brother of a monster could be only one super monster.

257
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,360
I did not stop losing…

258
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,990
But, if one fought today, I would gain!

259
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,630
Still an assertion without base.

260
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,000
Who is this…

261
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,340
You could beat me?

262
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,100
Eh, Ace!

263
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,980
Here my companions.

264
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,250
Oh, I am magic to meet you.

265
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,260
It is you who take care of my little brother.

266
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,110
Yes, it is that.

267
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,600
He does not have any manner and he must tire you per moments…

268
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,240
Yes, it is that.

269
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,560
You have all my recognition.

270
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,290
You must surely have much things to tell us.

271
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,480
Come inside.

272
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,720
I will prepare tea.

273
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,450
Not, thank you. But I appreciate the invitation.

274
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,220
It is very surprising.

275
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,650
It is clear…

276
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,510
I thought that, according to what Luffy had said to us, this guy was going to be sure of him, arrogant…

277
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,370
It is a lie.

278
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,490
Somebody of also polished cannot be the brother of Luffy.

279
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,700
He was so much better than his brother!

280
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,230
Fraternity is a marvellous thing!

281
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,600
That does not have any direction.

282
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,970
The ocean is a place full with surprises.

283
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,720
Eh, eh, everyone…

284
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,430
Then? They are not incredible?

285
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,570
Works baroque!

286
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,210
It is the fleet of the Billions!

287
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,180
Ace with the burning fists and Luffy Straw hat!

288
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,320
One will have to you!

289
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,180
One will show you the power of the Billions of Works Baroque!

290
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,950
Still them?

291
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,650
Luffy.

292
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,660
I occupy myself some.

293
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,570
What will it make?

294
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,890
With a so small boat…

295
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,820
One finally will have an outline…

296
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,400
… of the force of the Commander of the Second Division of the Pirates of White Beard.

297
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,570
Bring yourself, Ace with the burning fists!

298
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,230
If you believe capacity to beat us, bring yourself and test!

299
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,090
It jumped!

300
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,060
FIRE!

301
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,150
Make fall it into water!

302
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,080
GE… NIAL!

303
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,690
Colonel Smoker!

304
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,680
We found neither Luffy Straw hat, nor its crew.

305
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,090
Tashigi, that do you think about it?

306
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,420
Vivi was with these pirates.

307
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,320
Vivi!?

308
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,240
Was the Princess Nefertari Vivi with the pirates of Straw hat?

309
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,820
Is it them hostage?

310
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,670
Would they have kidnapped it while hoping to make use of it later on?

311
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,270
Not, Vivi seemed to be free, as if it belonged to their crew.

312
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,810
The Princess…?

313
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,830
One their friends…?

314
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,300
As I thought it, it is woven something in this country.

315
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Colonel Smoker!

316
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,420
Forgive our incompetence. The suspect,
Mr. 11, who was prisoner on our boat…

317
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,160
… was killed by a not identified person.

318
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,910
And we still did not find the pirates of Straw hat…

319
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,540
Do not panic.

320
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,880
I have my little idea on the place towards which Straw hat moves.

321
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,630
They have some after Crocodile.

322
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,210
Crocodile!?

323
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,950
A pirate approved by the Government…

324
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,710
It is one of Shichibukai, not?

325
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,950
I hate Shichibukai.

326
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,350
Especially that one.

327
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,510
But, it is an ally of the Government and Navy, not?

328
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,310
He was an extremely intelligent pirate.

329
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,680
It is not the kind of man to be subjected to a government, whatever it is!

330
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,850
It done it forever!

331
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,270
Tashigi, you point out that:

332
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,650
It does not matter how a pirate evolves/moves, it will remain always similar!

333
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,380
Straw hat will find Crocodile.

334
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,730
If we find them, the things will be cleared up.

335
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,740
And, when time comes, we will capture Straw hat!

336
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,510
They is super! Ace belongs to the crew!

337
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,520
KAMPAI!

338
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,830
Who said that?

339
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,990
With this delicious drink…

340
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,800
KAMPAI!

341
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,060
Do not make any you.

342
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,370
With food…

343
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,340
They always find a reason to clink glasses.

344
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,890
KAMPAI!

345
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,340
And for sand?

346
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,180
They are not good!

347
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,980
Will Ace, you really remain with us?

348
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,530
I am in the search of a man.

349
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,350
He is called Black Barbe.

350
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,580
Black beard?

351
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,210
The pirate who devastated the Kingdom of Drum?

352
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,590
It belonged to the Second Division of the Pirates of White Beard.

353
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,320
One of my men.

354
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,250
Until it makes the irrevocable one, for a pirate:

355
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,690
He killed all his team-members and fled with the boat…

356
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,340
As a Commander, I must find it and finish some with him.

357
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,200
This is why you have some after him.

358
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,510
The only reason which made me come in this country is that he was seen in Yuba.

359
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,010
One thus goes in the same city.

360
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,030
One is on the Sandora river.

361
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
Initially, one stops in Erumalu.

362
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
Then, one crosses the grounds of Arabasta to go here, in Yuba.

363
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,840
The chief of the rebels is there.

364
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,010
I included/understood.

365
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,560
You also go in Yuba.

366
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,500

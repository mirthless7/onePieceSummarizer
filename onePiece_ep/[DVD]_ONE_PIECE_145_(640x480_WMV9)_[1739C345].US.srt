1
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,450
Fixing of the cradle confirmed!

2
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,590
Barco Hunter stowing…

3
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,210
Succeeded!

4
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,330
WHO SUMMERS YOU BROTHEL?!

5
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,770
Who dares to come to encroach on my territory?!

6
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,580
Ah, a monkey.

7
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,210
It IS WHAT CA?!

8
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,010
It IS WHAT?!

9
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:35,700
Appearance of monsters!
Do not touch with the friends of White Beard!

10
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,130
Boss!

11
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,180
Boss!!

12
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
It is what this trick?!

13
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,150
It is what?! A continent?!

14
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,220
No idea, I want the knowledge!
I do not have anything considering! I do not see anything the whole!

15
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,640
It is right a dream!

16
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,990
A dream?! Really?!

17
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,490
Ouf… God thank you it is only one dream.

18
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,000
Thus said…

19
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,180
Our three friends have simply…

20
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,850
summer devoured alive with this wreck.

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,820
DO NOT SAY CA!

22
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
The pipes of air leave its mouth.

23
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,060
It is thus obvious that…

24
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,040
DECREE!

25
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,230
LUFFY AND THE OTHERS WERE EAT!!

26
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,450
ALL IS OF MT FAULT!

27
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,280
You dispatched them in the abyssals zone of Large Line!

28
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,470
You said that all will be well whereas you
knew any nothing and now they are…!

29
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,940
You are right…

30
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,650
Afflicted!

31
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,480
It is almost that… but not completely.

32
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,480
We would make better cut the pipes of air.

33
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,320
Without that, we will finish at the ocean floor.

34
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,830
Robin, be to you hefty man you, not true?!

35
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,410
Something dodo please!

36
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,650
I cannot.

37
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,960
It is too large.

38
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,410
Go the guy!

39
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,230
Everyone on the cord! Let us save the Boss!

40
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,610
It is the honor of the pirates of Masira which depends on it!

41
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,660
The Boss is always in life!

42
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,230
They are right!

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,310
It is the honesty of the crew which is put to the test!

44
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,520
Usopp!

45
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:02,970
Ouais!

46
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,550
Cut the pipes! Our safety passes above all!

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
You are démoniaque!

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
A DEMON!!

49
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,340
Hein?

50
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,070
What occurs?!

51
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,400
The night fell suddenly!

52
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,620
It is impossible…

53
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,640
It is not yet the hour.

54
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,260
THEN WHAT SE PASSES?!

55
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,980
LUFFY!

56
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,040
ZORO!

57
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,980
SANJI!

58
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,940
It is ill omen!

59
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,170
One fallen sudden night is the sign
precursor of the appearance of the Titans, Captain!

60
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,910
They will run our boat!

61
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,850
Dispatch we to save the Boss and draw us!

62
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,850
LUFFY!

63
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,550
Luffy, that goes?!

64
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,380
You did not die?!

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,620
Zoro! Sanji!

66
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,010
Weigh the anchor!

67
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,690
We draw from here!

68
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,880
This type is nut!

69
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,430
I am so glad to see you in life!

70
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,300
You are right!

71
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,170
Let us flee far from this tortoise!

72
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,040
A tortoise?

73
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,060
Not, there was a monkey under water!

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Still one of these monstres marins!

75
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,100
At the beginning, he got along well with Luffy…

76
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,530
Normal, between macaques!

77
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,470
But when he saw us carrying tricks of the wreck in our bags, he became insane!

78
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,190
How a mad gorilla!

79
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,260
It is Masira, the king of the fishing out.

80
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,360
But it is a miracle which you have
escaped with the jaws of this tortoise!

81
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,090
A tortoise? But which tortoise?

82
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,990
Hold, the tortoise acts oddly…

83
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,890
It as is paralyzed with the open large mouth…

84
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,640
It is for that you could escape to you!

85
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,790
OUAAAH! It IS WHAT THIS TRICK it?!

86
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,120
AWAKE you!

87
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,020
It is this thing which swallowed
the wreck in which you were!

88
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,120
Hein? It makes already night?

89
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,340
Luffy! Spin to us a knack!

90
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,070
One draws from here!

91
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,340
PAS SI VITE!

92
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,140
THE GUY!

93
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,960
Do not believe that you can subtilize…

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,360
treasures found on the territory of
Masira-sama, and to draw you like that!

95
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,250
Treasures?

96
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,760
You found treasures?

97
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,240
Ouais! Full!

98
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,360
Ca fears…

99
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,060
If it starts to devastate the boat…

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,990
B-B-boss…

101
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,040
Behind you…

102
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,010
Mmh… what?

103
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,970
GEAAAANTS!!

104
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,260
I do not return from there…

105
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,210
These things… were too enormous to be true…

106
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,350
And Ben, Grand Line is right one
succession of strange phenomena…

107
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,470
And today…

108
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,020
A gigantic ship falls us above…

109
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,270
Then the needle of the Log Poses which points towards the sky…

110
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,960
A monkey mild nutter unloads and fishes out the wreck…

111
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,160
But then, a monstrous tortoise devours it…

112
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,840
The night fall abruptly…

113
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,420
And of the monsters hundred times more
large how of the giants appear!

114
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,530
I acknowledge that even me, I was cold of it in the back.

115
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,480
RELEASE!

116
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,190
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

117
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,190
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

118
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,740
Thank you Yonda, you are our first leecher

119
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,520
Pfiouuu… These monsters
were really titanic…

120
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,720
Ouais.

121
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,170
I hope that they will never be re-examined.

122
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,860
You know, Chopper…

123
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,780
If I had wanted, I could have put a beating to them.

124
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,230
It IS TRUE?!

125
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,440
I already embanked ten like that of them, once.

126
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,220
TEN LIKE CA?!

127
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,640
By here, the guy.

128
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,480
You want that I recall you why you plunged?

129
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,770
All that you have
paid, it is this heap of refuse!

130
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,910
I do not see any index on the means of going in the sky!

131
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,710
There was nothing of all that in bottom. Nothing the whole!

132
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,810
It is the truth, Nami-san.

133
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,640
The ship seemed to be attacked.

134
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,740
Or then, there was a mutiny and the crew entretué itself.

135
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,840
It is precisely for that it
we was necessary information!

136
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,320
You include/understand?

137
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,430
If ever we manage to reach this celestial island,

138
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:44,640
we could undergo it well
even leaves that this crew!

139
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,410
More the life could save us!

140
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,850
These rusted swords, these old plates and this octopus do not interest me!

141
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,190
It is of a log book and charts which we need!

142
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,370
What is it that, Luffy?

143
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,300
An armor.

144
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,450
It exploded the armor!

145
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,380
Look at, Nami-san!
I brought back pretty shells to you!

146
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,570
You can put yourself them where I think!

147
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,510
Nami-san is so nice when it is in anger!

148
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,540
Stop that.

149
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,440
Release to him the tennis shoes.

150
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,840
You are furious?

151
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,080
Difficult to make differently.

152
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,280
I am surrounded finished cretins!

153
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,690
One is completely lost now.

154
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,970
Hold!

155
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,870
Hein?

156
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,000
Eternal Poses…

157
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,710
It is…

158
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,520
I subtilized it on the ship of this monkey… if.

159
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,930
You are only on whom I can count!

160
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
He, it is well an octopus that?!

161
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,770
One has only to be made stuffed pellets!

162
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,880
You must undergo much stress.

163
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,610
Jaya?

164
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,330
Ca must be their general headquarter.

165
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Jaya?

166
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,220
It is there that one goes?

167
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,170
It is YOU which decide, cranium of sparrow!

168
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,930
Ok!

169
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,340
Cape on Jaya!

170
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,630
Jaya, here us are!

171
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,610
Nami… It is by where?

172
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,660
With starboard.

173
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,330
Chopper, helps me!

174
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,260
I arrive!

175
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,840
Jaya, ahead all!

176
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,230
He, wait one minute…

177
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,810
If one goes to Jaya…

178
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,200
will our Log Installation be given to zero, not?

179
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,900
What wants to say…

180
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,700
that we will not be able to go any more in the sky!

181
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,740
STOOOOOP! ONE DECREE JAYA!!

182
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,000
He, Nami!

183
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,150
It is what this history?!

184
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,900
What thus?

185
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,030
It is you who decided to go in Jaya.

186
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,630
Ah yes, it is true.

187
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,590
But I did not know that!

188
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,150
It is not my fault if you do not reflect!

189
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,280
The Log Poses always functioned like that!

190
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,330
Ah yes, it is true.

191
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,490
Good, your attention please!

192
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,390
I am the Captain, then I will decide our course!

193
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,450
I want to go on the celestial island!

194
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,110
Very well, and how?

195
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,290
One should perhaps ask somebody.

196
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,630
Yes, let us ask somebody.

197
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,930
Therefore, why not in Jaya?

198
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,920
OK! Jaya, here us are!

199
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,710
All that for that!

200
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,260
The Log Installation will spend some time to change.

201
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,890
Let us return in Jaya and
let us leave ahead that it is not reloaded!

202
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,120
Let us hope for how the chance is with us!

203
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,900
Ouais, one has only to do that!

204
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,590
It left, the guy!

205
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,920
Let us leave for Jaya! Country of the Meat at will!

206
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,680
OUAIS!

207
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,020
Stop fantasmer!

208
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,830
I wonder what resembles Jaya.

209
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,890
Nami-swan! Robin-chwan!

210
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,190
I prepared you “pellets
special with-octopus-single-with-world " lady!

211
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,290
Shit! It was which these guys, brothel?!

212
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,090
To send people in the air like that…

213
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,850
Captain…

214
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,500
Captain!

215
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,970
What?!

216
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,340
You… you are certain that it is here?

217
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,000
The place where the John Captain hid the treasure…

218
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,020
that it piled up while sowing
terror by thirst for richnesses…

219
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,220
The legendary cave?

220
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,860
Yes, I am sure.

221
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,600
Be careful and continue!

222
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,360
Listen, the treasures are always kept or protected by many traps around!

223
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,710
One moment of carelessness and
you are dead men!

224
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,020
Which kind of horrible creature will attack us?

225
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,770
Which person who is damned traps will make us discover the Hell?

226
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,690
Go, the guys! Still a beautiful day to dig a tunnel!

227
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,350
Yes, chief!

228
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,810
Oh, you are undoubtedly the new ones!

229
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,270
Ah, to perspire a skilled, they is marvellous, chief!

230
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,330
Yes chief, a man anything else needs only one pickaxe in the hand!

231
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,770
Ouais, a pickaxe!

232
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,920
And our sweat will build this tunnel in order to give the smile to all those which will cross it!

233
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,950
Ouais! Ouais!

234
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,460
And after this hard labor, we will drink one pint in a bar and…

235
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,760
HOW YOU DARE ME
TO MAKE WORK AND SWEAT?!

236
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,550
Baggy captain, we do not find the treasure of the John Captain.

237
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,430
Moji, moron!

238
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,760
Have more tact!

239
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,640
The Captain obviously chose the bad island!

240
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,090
The others do not have
to notice how it is red of shame!

241
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,740
WHO HAS A RED NOSE AND A LARGE BOTTOM?!

242
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,290
At all events, Captain…

243
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,520
Do we have really time for that?

244
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,830
What will we make?

245
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,500
This person who is damned Straw hat and its crew…

246
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,650
are already regarded as large pirates on Grand Line.

247
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,030
You are only one noisy imbecile. Keep the head on the shoulders!

248
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,790
We will let them sail.

249
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,800
What do you want to say?

250
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,790
, You listen know the witches?

251
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:12,530
Before eating the small children,
they start by fattening them!

252
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,310
You see?

253
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,200
In other words, more the crew of Straw hat goes up high…

254
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,340
I included/understood!

255
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,780
Then as soon as you get rid some, your fame is even larger!

256
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,810
Completely!

257
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,130
It is a brilliant plan!

258
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,250
Captain, it is necessary to celebrate that!

259
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,330
We will have fun the festival all the night!

260
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,660
There is not really what to make the clowns, the guy!

261
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,800
Which is the interest to work out
a plan to put Luffy at the step…

262
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,660
whereas you do not even know where it is?

263
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,120
Let us go, awakes, Alvida!

264
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,300
It is necessary to be burst above all!

265
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,450
Do Oh, you seek Luffy? I will say to you where it is.

266
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,070
You see?

267
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,750
This type will say to us where it is!

268
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,580
But be to you which you?!

269
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,770
Oh, sorry to stop your small festival.

270
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,290
I was simply attracted by the delicious odor of your feast.

271
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,200
I am called Ace.
Please, accept my excuses.

272
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,900
Oh, useless to make manners.

273
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,400
We should excuse us too us.

274
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,600
I asked you which you was, brothel!

275
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,200
I insane of knowing your name!

276
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,440
You unload and you underestimate me, dumb!

277
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,400
Captain!

278
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,360
Captain, this man…!

279
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,020
It is the Burning Fist!

280
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,950
Ace with the Burning Fists!

281
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,750
The commander of the second fleet of White Beard!

282
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,450
White beard!

283
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,070
Do Ah, you know the old man? Cool…

284
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,380
HE FELL ASLEEP!

285
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,980
NOT.

286
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,980
Why not?! It is an unhoped-for chance!

287
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,080
If one gets rid of Ace to the Burning Fists, we will become famous in one nothing time!

288
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,480
I AI SAY NOT!

289
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,810
Listen, band of imbeciles,
remember that well!

290
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,800
Whatever the situation, never, with large never,

291
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,710
one does not touch with the men of White Beard! It is clear?

292
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,910
White beard… This man…

293
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,250
This legendary man was the only one with being able to compete with the Lord of the Pirates, Roger!

294
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,950
To date, it is without question it
the most powerful pirate in the world!

295
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,000
He is the man nearest to more
large of all the treasures, One Part!

296
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,360
And more than all, Barbe White does not tolerate that one of its men is made kill.

297
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,470
Here is what a kind of man it is!

298
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,630
You seem to know it well.

299
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,270
Oh that yes…

300
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,130
A long ago…

301
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,500
Here, on Large Line… I dealt with him.

302
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,900
Hein? Then as that you know the old man?

303
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,230
HE EAST AWAKES!

304
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,240
Go the guy it left! Go!

305
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,560
And this festival then?

306
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,410
Heu ouais!

307
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,110
We was having fun the festival, it is that?

308
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,400
He, be rather sympathetic for you like guy, say to me!

309
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,750
Go, wood!

310
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,340
Oh! Oh! You have a lion!

311
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:07,890
Go!

312
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,100
Jump in this circle of fire!

313
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,580
Do what say you the Sir, Richie!

314
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,200
Groar!

315
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,580
Where the Boss passed?!

316
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,800
BOSS!!

317
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,290
I AM, THE GUY!

318
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,290
He does not seem to be here!

319
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
HE HO!!

320
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,300
Let us see further!

321
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,680
AYE, AYE SIR!

322
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,320
HE! RETURN!

323
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,620
DO NOT LEAVE!

324
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,260
I ask for myself… which kind of island east Jaya.

325
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,200
I said it to you, it is the Country
meat. Country of the Meat.

326
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,310
You have just invented it.

327
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,330
In any case, one can say that heaps of pellets were eaten.

328
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,950
Then stop eating some.

329
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,380
They are the shares of Nami-san and Robin-chan.

330
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,900
They said that they did not want any!

331
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,810
Return them to us!

332
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,060
Return them to us!

333
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,510
Close it!

334
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,810
Return them to us, dumb!

335
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,410
Return them to us, moron!

336
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,710
Close it!

337
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,070
Return them to us!

338
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,930
Close it!

339
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,770
But… is there really an island in the sky?

340
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,130
Up to now, we never met anything of tel.

341
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,860
Even if our good sense is some shaken, there is no reason not to believe in it.

342
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,690
It is that, the logic of this ocean.

343
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,780
The key to go on the celestial island…

344
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,430
… is on Jaya.

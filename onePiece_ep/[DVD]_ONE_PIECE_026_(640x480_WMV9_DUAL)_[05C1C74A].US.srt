1
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,870
ZEFF AND SANJI'S DREAM.
THE SEA OF DREAMS, ALL BLUE.

2
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,790
Gin!

3
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,840
Regardless of how great a man he was before,

4
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,840
now he's just an ordinary chef.

5
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,510
Blasting his head off is no problem now.

6
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,350
You want to save this man, don't you, Sanji san?

7
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,140
So just heed my word and get off this ship.

8
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,440
I don't wanna have to kill you!

9
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,770
Leave this ship?

10
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,030
Not a chance!

11
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,990
You look pathetic, old fart.

12
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,620
In that state, you can't order the
cooks around to fight, can you?

13
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,450
I don't want to hear all this
crap from a small eggplant.

14
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,830
Who are you calling puny, asshole!

15
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,380
Stop treating me like a kid!

16
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,960
That damned Sanji!

17
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,510
He's not gonna abandon the owner, is he?

18
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,260
Gin, aim that pistol at me.

19
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,140
Are you a moron? You'll get killed!

20
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,300
Maybe.

21
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,020
Sanji-san... Why?

22
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,190
If you're so eager to die, let me do the honors.

23
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,190
I owe you one for my nose.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,650
Don't you dare move now.

25
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,150
If you don't want to get your boss's head blasted.

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,700
Ultimate Killing Technique...

27
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,740
Pearl Present!

28
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,410
Sanji!

29
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,160
Why didn't you dodge that?

30
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,210
If I did that, he'd pull the trigger!

31
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,420
Why are you doing all this?

32
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,210
If you'd just abandon this restaurant,
everyone will be saved!

33
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,380
It's that simple!

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,050
This restaurant is that old man's treasure.

35
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,390
I'm the one who took everything from that old fart.

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,150
His power.

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,070
And his dreams.

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,530
That's why, now...

39
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,570
I don't want that old fart to lose anything, anymore!

40
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,620
Sanji, watch out!

41
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,700
Pearl Cross!!!

42
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,080
Sanji!

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,880
All Blue?

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,300
Yeah! the legendary sea!

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
It's out there somewhere.

46
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,930
I'm sure of it!

47
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,680
Are you a fool or something?

48
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,480
Of course that legend exists.

49
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,860
True.

50
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,770
As cooks of the sea,

51
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,360
even we'd like to see that sea, at least once.

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,440
Yeah!

53
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,740
I will definitely find that sea one day!

54
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,530
You'll find it eh, Sanji?

55
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,620
First of all, do you know where All Blue is?

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,540
Of course I know!

57
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,460
Don't think i'm dumb!

58
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,630
East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, South Blue.

59
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,170
East It's the sea in which fish from all these seas swim in.

60
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,760
That's the All Blue for ye!

61
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,390
For a cook of the sea, it's an unattainable paradise!

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,970
It's my dream.

63
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,060
No kidding, 'coz you can get any ingredient of the world in that sea.

64
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,730
That's what our cooking skills were meant for!

65
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,730
Yeah!

66
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,900
There are some that'd sacrifice their lives to find that sea.

67
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,650
Too bad it doesn't exist.

68
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,950
It can't possibly exist, a marvelous sea like All Blue.

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,540
If you stop and think about it, you'll get it.

70
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,750
Only cooks that daydream all the time think of that nonsense.

71
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,920
Well! now! That should be enough of this foolish talk.

72
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,920
Go get the dishes, Sanji.

73
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,380
Man, what a waste!

74
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,140
There's so many leftovers.

75
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,930
They didn't even touch this plate, even though I put in a lot of effort into it.

76
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,350
Customers these days sure don't have appetite.

77
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,560
Everyone oughtta stop eating those leftovers!

78
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,560
I just got rid of some that was spoiled.

79
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,940
It's that kind of attitude that makes you only half normal human size.

80
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Don't forget that we're cooks of the sea.

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,070
You can never tell what'll happen on the sea.

82
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,620
You don't want to be caught off guard.

83
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,200
Say, how about some of this for ye?

84
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,750
No way!

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,380
Everyone! Calm down!

86
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,380
Please calm down!

87
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,550
Pirates!

88
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,430
Pirates?

89
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,930
That ship...

90
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,980
They're pirates!

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,980
It's Red Leg Zeff's ship!

92
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,730
Has he returned from the Grand Line?

93
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,250
Are you this pirate ship's captain, Red Leg Zeff..?

94
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,080
What are your intentions?

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,090
Everyone!

96
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,970
The loot... grab it all!

97
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,810
Shit! I can't just let them kill me!

98
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,520
I can't get killed by these goons!

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,770
What's with this kid?

100
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,730
Hey, brat. That thing's dangerous, so don't go swinging that around.

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,530
See? I'm bleeding.

102
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,990
This is really life threatening!

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,820
Shut the hell up!

104
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,410
You think I can just let myself be killed by the likes you?!

105
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,660
Sanji!

106
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
This looks bad! Don't annoy them!

107
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,040
A kid that wants to die so badly, just kill him off already.

108
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
Like I'm going to die!

109
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,840
If I'm gonna get killed by you, I'll just kill you first!

110
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,470
Sanji!

111
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,050
Good one Captain!

112
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,370
No mercy whatsover!

113
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,650
Like I can die...

114
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,070
I...

115
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,330
I have to get to All Blue someday.

116
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,040
''All Blue'', he said?

117
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,290
What a stupid dream!

118
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,250
Captain, tell him.

119
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,510
Such a thing doesn't exist, even in the Grand Line.

120
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,050
That idiot! He's still going on about that!

121
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,570
In a place like this...

122
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,280
In a place like this, I can't just get myself killed by these pirates.

123
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,200
Captain, let's get outta here!

124
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,700
There's a strom approching, and it's even bigger than last time!

125
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,670
Very well! You lot put the treasure you've looted onto that ship.

126
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,960
We're leaving.

127
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,690
Sanji!

128
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,690
Captain!

129
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,450
Damn kid!

130
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,660
Captain!

131
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,160
Why all the trouble for just one brat?

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,340
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

133
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,430
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

134
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,390
So you came to eh, small fry?

135
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,180
You're something else.

136
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,760
Pirat...

137
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,640
There's no way you could move!

138
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,520
Whose kick do you think you took earlier?

139
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,270
Where's the ship?

140
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,820
Who know...

141
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,530
In that kind of storm, wouldn't be surprised if you got destroyed.

142
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,360
We are the only ones who made it here.

143
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,200
There's no vegetation or animals on this rocky island.

144
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,500
You might think of catching fish,

145
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,290
but if you go down once, there's no return.

146
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,210
Dying like rats, makes you wanna cry, doesn't it?

147
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,300
It's all your fault anyway!

148
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,090
I'm gonna kill you!

149
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,340
Stop barking.

150
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,600
All we can do is wait 'til help arrives.

151
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,350
Otherwise you'll use up all your energy and simply turn into a skeleton.

152
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
A skeleton?

153
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,520
Me?

154
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,480
That sack over there is your share.

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,070
If you eat like you normally would, it should last you five days.

156
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,700
So use your head on how you go about it.

157
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,660
Good thing we're both cooks, eh?

158
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,170
Wait!

159
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,000
Is that your share?

160
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,130
Isn't that a bit too big? three times at least!

161
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,630
But of course.

162
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,310
I am a full-size adult, my stomach's much bigger.

163
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,270
Be grateful that I spared you any.

164
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,020
Don't expect me to feel sorry for you.

165
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,320
You old fart!

166
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,120
You wait on the other side.

167
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,080
When you see a ship, let me know immediately.

168
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,080
Until then, we shouldn't contact each other.

169
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,630
Because we can't afford to waste any energy.

170
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,300
And keep praying.

171
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,880
Why that old fart!

172
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,050
If a ship comes, like I'd go tell him!

173
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,260
I'm all set.

174
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,510
I have enough food for five days.

175
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,600
Within these five days, one or two ships have gotta come by.

176
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,650
But there is still a chance that one won't come.

177
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,440
So, maybe I should divide this into 20-day portions?

178
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,570
If I give 20 days, a ship is bound to come!

179
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm all good!

180
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,700
I'll definitely be saved!

181
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,160
Piece of cake!

182
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,630
None today, eh..?

183
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,470
It's alright, they'll come in a two or three days!

184
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,180
I don't want to die.

185
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,080
The last loaf of bread.

186
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,040
Better take it in well.

187
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,260
Man, what a wastel

188
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,850
There's so many leftovers.

189
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,600
Everyone oughtta stop eating those leftoversl

190
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,440
I just got rid of some that was spoiled.

191
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,360
Say, how about some of this for ye?

192
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,660
No way!

193
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,020
No way! No wayI

194
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,760
My last bit of bread!

195
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,010
That old fart...

196
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,130
wonder ifhe's dead...?

197
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,490
He's still alive!

198
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,410
Moreover, his ration... there's so much of it left!

199
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,210
There's still much food left!

200
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,800
No matter what, I have to get my hands on it!

201
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,300
It's his entire fault to begin with!

202
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,970
I want to live on!

203
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,560
Why are you here, small eggplant?

204
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,570
Perhaps you saw a ship?

205
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,780
I came to take your food!

206
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,830
If you're gonna kill me, then go ahead and try.

207
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,360
Without anything to eat, I'd die anyway.

208
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,990
To save so much for your own self...!

209
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:53,150
I thought we were not to contact each other until one of us saw a ship?

210
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,860
What's this? It's all mere treasure?

211
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,780
Having money but nothing to eat.

212
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,490
Funny story, don't you think?

213
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,670
Hey. This sack's just full of treasure.

214
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
What's this nonsense?

215
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,470
What's going on here?

216
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,960
What's about food?

217
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,630
Didn't you eat anything until now?

218
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,640
Hey, say something!

219
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,070
What happened to that leg of yours?

220
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,670
It was then...

221
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,840
Wasn't it just a dream?

222
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,840
To have you saving me...

223
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,640
The food you handed me, was that all of it?

224
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,520
Precisely.

225
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,610
Without that leg, you can no longer be a pirate, now can you?

226
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,900
Guess you're right.

227
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,360
Why?

228
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,110
You didn't have to!

229
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,450
I don't remember asking you to treat me so kindly!

230
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,450
Why?

231
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,290
WHY?!

232
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,500
You... You have the same dream as I do.

233
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,630
All Blue?

234
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,930
But, even your crew said that such a thing doesn't exist.

235
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,260
But it does!

236
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,930
When the times comes, travel to the Grand Line!

237
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,890
All Blue is definitely there!

238
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,400
I certainly can't be a pirate anymore.

239
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,030
So this time, you go there and find it.

240
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,240
Hey! Old man, don't die!

241
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,700
Don't just lecture then die out on me!

242
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,120
This sea...

243
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:21,250
I wonder how many people have cursed the vastness of this sea and died.

244
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,760
Up until now, whenever I've been in a drawn out starvation dilemma,

245
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,550
I'd think to myself,

246
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,680
''Wouldn't it be nice if there was a restaurant somewhere on this vast sea?''

247
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,640
Restaurant?

248
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,690
Yeah.

249
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:43,860
If I manage to escape this hitch, I'd bet everything into building my own restaurant.

250
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,950
Yosh! I'll help you out, so don't die on me!

251
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,910
For a weak small eggplant like you, that'd be impossible!

252
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,330
I'll get stronger!

253
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,290
So... don't die!

254
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,930
Hey!!!

255
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,270
Help us!

256
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,310
The old man!

257
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,150
Help this old fart!

258
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,700
Hey!!

259
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:37,160
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

260
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,790
Heeeey!!!

261
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,210
That old fart!

262
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,970
He gave up his leg so that I could live.

263
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,100
I too...

264
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:00,310
If I don't place my life on the line as well,
I won't be able to repay that old fart!

265
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,200
Why... why are you standing up, Sanji-san?

266
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,700
Even if I can make this restaurant
last for just one moment longer.

267
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,120
That bastard... is he trying to get killed?

268
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,040
Damn kid!

269
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,170
Yet another refined speech.

270
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,260
But now, this restaurant will be out of business.

271
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,600
From now on, it will be a pirate ship!

272
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Idiot! Stop it!

273
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,310
Don't you dare hit it!

274
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,770
What's that guy thinking?

275
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,410
GOMU GOMU NO...

276
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,820
AXE!

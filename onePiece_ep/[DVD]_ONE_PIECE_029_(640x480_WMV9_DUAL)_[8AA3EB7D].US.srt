1
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:56,814
You... insignlficant bug!

2
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:07,229
Waiter boy!

3
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:15,265
Even if you're equipped with hundreds of weapons,

4
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:20,380
You still might not be able to defeat the one 'spear' he has.

5
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:27,959
At least...

6
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:31,059
That kid...

7
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,118
Has no hint of hesitation.

8
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:34,895
Is it that he has what it takes to survive?

9
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:34,937
Is it that he has what it takes to survive?

10
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,063
Is it that he has what it takes to survive?

11
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:37,288
Is it that he has what it takes to survive?

12
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:38,690
Or does his conviction mean he refuses to die.

13
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,567
Or does his conviction mean he refuses to die.

14
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:44,814
Conviction?

15
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:49,776
This is your grave!

16
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:49,826
This is your grave!

17
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:51,386
This is your grave!

18
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:01,505
What?! My Great Battle Spear!

19
00:03:01,505 --> 00:03:03,038
What did you do it?!

20
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,008
I gave it five punches in a row.

21
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:05,968
I gave it five punches in a row.

22
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,028
Your spear's useless now.

23
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:12,558
Why, that bastard's not bad at all.

24
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,642
Why, that bastard's not bad at all.

25
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:14,101
Maybe we can pull this one off!

26
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:15,727
Maybe we can pull this one off!

27
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,063
This is no good!

28
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,398
He broke the Great War Spear?

29
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:20,482
He broke the Great War Spear?

30
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,116
But being hit by those huge blasts,

31
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,118
His body won't be able to take much more.

32
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:47,496
OUTCOME OF A DEADLY BATTLE!
THE SPEAR INSIDE!

33
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,481
You get the picture now?

34
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,301
This much space should be plenty for me.

35
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,391
This much space will be enough to pulverize you!

36
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:05,027
What?

37
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:05,777
What?

38
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:08,162
That thing of yours.
That spear's all broken.

39
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:10,207
It's nothing but a bomb-on-a-stick now.

40
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,758
Its power has halved.

41
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,285
You think so?

42
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:14,411
Yeah!

43
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,039
Bomb-on-a-stick, eh? That's not so bad.

44
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,415
Bomb-on-a-stick, eh? That's not so bad.

45
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:22,586
Its power is sufficient to blast you outta here.

46
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,217
You're all battered up. Looks
like you're barely making it.

47
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,219
No, I'm not.

48
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:33,722
Behold!

49
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:36,900
Since you dared to defy the great Don Krieg,

50
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:40,528
You are sentenced to death!

51
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:42,522
I'm not gonna die, so there!

52
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:48,378
Hey! Over here!

53
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:49,270
You li'l monkey!

54
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,947
Die!

55
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:50,280
Die!

56
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:58,872
Stupid bastard.

57
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,462
No use!

58
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:09,366
How many weapons does this guy have?!

59
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,293
How many weapons does this guy have?!

60
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,712
GOMU GOMU NO...

61
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,357
GATLING GUN!!!

62
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:35,450
What in the world is that?

63
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,401
What in the world is that?

64
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,486
His arms have multiplied!

65
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,747
Hey! Waiter boy!

66
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:41,915
That a boy!

67
00:05:58,974 --> 00:05:59,774
Useless!

68
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,811
Against this metal armor,

69
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,897
your punches are useless.

70
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:06,148
It didn't even leave a scratch.

71
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:07,107
It didn't even leave a scratch.

72
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:07,566
It didn't even leave a scratch.

73
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,571
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

74
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:12,779
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

75
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:26,835
Don!

76
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,424
Cut this crap!

77
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,557
Boring! Boring!

78
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:41,800
This is absolutely boring!

79
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,230
How could this armor possibly break with only a
few hundred punches from this little monkey?

80
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,314
How could this armor possibly break with only a
few hundred punches from this little monkey?

81
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,901
I think I'm almost there.

82
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,486
I think I'm almost there.

83
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,523
He's gone!

84
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:58,158
Over here.

85
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:58,742
Over here.

86
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:05,207
Listen,

87
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:10,199
with the best-crafted equipment, the greatest
power, and most powerful weapons,

88
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:12,172
You'll be acknowledged to be strong.

89
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:13,799
You'll be acknowledged to be strong.

90
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,383
You'll be acknowledged to be strong.

91
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,218
A very powerful person!

92
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:20,556
And that'd be me!

93
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,682
And that'd be me!

94
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,599
GOMU GOMU NO...

95
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,226
GOMU GOMU NO...

96
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:24,726
That's totally useless!

97
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:25,727
That's totally useless!

98
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:26,603
That's totally useless!

99
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:27,854
You can't do much with persistence alone.

100
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,815
You can't do much with persistence alone.

101
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:34,069
BAZOOKA!!!

102
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:34,111
BAZOOKA!!!

103
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:34,403
BAZOOKA!!!

104
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,238
BAZOOKA!!!

105
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:46,582
It's no use!

106
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:47,291
It's no use!

107
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,417
This is the limit of your strength.

108
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,626
This is the limit of your strength.

109
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,172
What?!

110
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:54,798
My invincible armor is breaking?

111
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:56,216
My invincible armor is breaking?

112
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,929
But it's too late.

113
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:01,889
You're done for, Hammerboy!

114
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:02,723
You're done for, Hammerboy!

115
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:04,741
You're done for, Hammerboy!

116
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:10,939
It's a trap! Run!!

117
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:11,398
It's a trap! Run!!

118
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,576
Waiter boy!!

119
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:41,877
Having what it takes to survive...

120
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,263
Refusing to die...

121
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,056
Refusing to die...

122
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:44,932
Refusing to die...

123
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:51,296
GOMU GOMU NO...

124
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,773
What?!!

125
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,320
BAZOOKA!!!

126
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:25,806
Great! Yeah!

127
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,140
You're great, waiter boy!

128
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,516
You're great, waiter boy!

129
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,102
I WIN!

130
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,026
You wish, damn brat!

131
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:38,527
He's still alive!

132
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,319
He's still alive!

133
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:42,781
Oh no.

134
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,740
Oh no.

135
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:47,953
You can't run away from this iron net?

136
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:48,537
You can't run away from this iron net?

137
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:50,455
You can't run away from this iron net?

138
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,260
The sea is below us!

139
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:05,721
It's clear who the victor is, hammerboy!

140
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:09,308
I'm always the one who has the last laugh!

141
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:15,772
That's our Don for ye!

142
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:16,773
Get rid of him!

143
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,025
Yeah!

144
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,740
No problem, 'coz my hands and feet are still free.

145
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:26,766
Why don't you just stand down?

146
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:30,787
Why all this?

147
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:31,788
What?!

148
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,332
This time...

149
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:33,999
This time...

150
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,633
It's really over!

151
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,384
GOMU GOMU NO...

152
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,681
SLEDGEHAMMER!!

153
00:10:56,813 --> 00:11:01,006
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

154
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,065
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

155
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:22,548
SLEDGEHAMMER!!

156
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,613
Don Krieg's defeated...

157
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,949
How can he be defeated? How?!

158
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,743
Way to go, waiter boy!

159
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:52,160
Great!

160
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,495
Great!

161
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,332
That guy did it!

162
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,625
Awesome!

163
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,143
Is this for real?

164
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,328
But that was Don Krieg!

165
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,591
He's just too powerful... He's something else!

166
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:05,632
He's just too powerful... He's something else!

167
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,060
What's all the ruckus?

168
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,346
You're up now?

169
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:14,165
He's defeated.. your Don has lost.

170
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:15,183
What?!

171
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:15,684
What?!

172
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,961
If you've got the time to space out,
why don't you go and rescue him?

173
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:37,748
He's not going to resurface, you know.

174
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:38,265
He's not going to resurface, you know.

175
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:39,041
What?!

176
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,502
Those who gain powers from the devil
fruit are cast away by the sea,

177
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,463
becoming deadweight in waters.

178
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:44,922
What'd you say, old fart?!

179
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,882
What'd you say, old fart?!

180
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:49,467
Why didn't you say so earlier?!

181
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,762
I'll hold you responsible if anything happens!

182
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:11,031
Where is he?

183
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:11,865
Where is he?

184
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,147
Hey, hang in there!

185
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:45,816
Aren't you the one who refuses to die?

186
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:47,334
Aren't you the one who refuses to die?

187
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,837
Isn't that what you believe in?

188
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,186
I'm not gonna die.

189
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:57,369
I'm not gonna die.

190
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:03,690
This isn't my grave.

191
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:06,753
Damn it.

192
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:11,508
Zoro!!!

193
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:12,050
Zoro!!!

194
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,218
Zoro!!!

195
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:13,760
Zoro!!!

196
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:20,248
If you already knew the outcome
why didn't you give up?

197
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,478
It's simple! Just let go of your ambitions!

198
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:24,354
It's simple! Just let go of your ambitions!

199
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:24,479
It's simple! Just let go of your ambitions!

200
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:35,991
All of em...

201
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,887
I don't know.

202
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,723
I'm not sure why myself.

203
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:56,002
But if I were to take even one step back,

204
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,720
I believe that all those important oaths, promises,
and many other deals 'til now,

205
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,738
I believe that all those important oaths, promises,
and many other deals 'til now,

206
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:00,766
Will all go to waste and I'll never be able
to return before you, ever again.

207
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,934
Will all go to waste and I'll never be able
to return before you, ever again.

208
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,437
Will all go to waste and I'll never be able
to return before you, ever again.

209
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:11,189
You still can't do much against
the one 'spear' he has.

210
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:13,403
Someone who'd hold that same spear
for his own foolish reasons.

211
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:18,089
Someone who'd hold that same spear
for his own foolish reasons.

212
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,762
All Blue!

213
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:39,429
All Blue!

214
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:48,605
Hey, waiter boy!

215
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:49,731
Hey, waiter boy!

216
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:51,767
Don't you dare die on me now!

217
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:03,370
Don, what's wrong?!

218
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,371
Don, what's wrong?!

219
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:06,540
Why's the Don..?

220
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:07,749
Don Krieg lost?

221
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,376
Don Krieg lost?

222
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:11,461
No way...

223
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:12,754
He's the King of the East Blue.

224
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,263
He's the King of the East Blue.

225
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,332
That man... that man...

226
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:20,935
That man... that man...

227
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,181
Even if you say so,

228
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,683
Even if you say so,

229
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,810
See for yourself!

230
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:27,436
The armor he's so proud of is shattered to bits!

231
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,855
The armor he's so proud of is shattered to bits!

232
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,232
This is a must see!

233
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,317
This is a must see!

234
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:34,884
Won't you have a look?

235
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,321
He's the only man I've admired.

236
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:39,288
He's the only man I've admired.

237
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,067
I always believed that he's the best.

238
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,934
Hang on a sec, bud!

239
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,086
The poison will spread all over
your body if you move about!

240
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,337
Lie down!

241
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:53,921
Lie down!

242
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:54,713
That'd be fatal!

243
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:54,963
That'd be fatal!

244
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:55,297
Don't say we didn t warn you!

245
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,356
Don't say we didn t warn you!

246
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:57,382
Waiter boy!

247
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,008
Waiter boy!

248
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,734
You can't die, you hear?!

249
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,139
You've got things to do, don't you?

250
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:05,098
Hey, you can't just die!

251
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:06,683
Hey, you can't just die!

252
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:08,852
Waiter boy, say something...

253
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,062
Say something already!

254
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:10,854
Say something already!

255
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,898
Waiter boy, don't die!

256
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:26,794
Why you...

257
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,791
You're such a pain in the butt.

258
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,918
I'm the strongest.

259
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:33,377
It's me! It's me who won!

260
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:35,753
It's me! It's me who won!

261
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:38,698
No one can surpass my powers!

262
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:41,876
Don, not that!

263
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,095
Hold him! He's unconscious!

264
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,054
Hold him! He's unconscious!

265
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,350
Don't do that, Don!

266
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,479
I have to win with my power!

267
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:05,517
I must win!

268
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:09,955
I'm the strongest man!

269
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,582
I'm the strongest man!

270
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:20,257
Don Krieg...

271
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,259
We've lost.

272
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:24,011
Commander!

273
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:24,761
Commander!

274
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,724
Let's retreat and start all over again.

275
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,609
Thanks for everything, Sanji-san.

276
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,486
Come here again, wont' ye?

277
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:43,113
Sanji-san,

278
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:43,880
Sanji-san,

279
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,265
Give him this message for me when he gets up...

280
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:55,482
Tell him that we shall meet again at the Grand Line.

281
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:57,869
But, you..?

282
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,872
I've given much thought into it.

283
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,673
It's the only thing I want to do.

284
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,884
It's the only thing I want to do.

285
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:10,069
I'm not sure when Don Krieg's ambition
became mine as well, but...

286
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:19,996
I may only have a few hours to live.

287
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:24,855
It's kinda weird for me declaring my decision,
just because I'm running out of time.

288
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:28,408
But this time, I want to do what I want to do.

289
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,485
Trusting my instincts.

290
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,612
Then I won't have anywhere to run anymore.

291
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:41,213
What loyalty do I have to Don Krieg?

292
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:46,635
I've just been using Don Krieg's name
as a shield so I could run away.

293
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:53,671
When your mind's made up, you eventually
pay less attention to things like,

294
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,053
Being scared of a strong enemy, or
how not to get yourself injured.

295
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:59,314
That's what he taught me.

296
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:05,028
Patty! Carne!

297
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:05,571
Patty! Carne!

298
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:08,180
Give him the ship we use to get supplies!

299
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:10,242
What? Are you serious?

300
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:13,953
Why should we give the pirates a ship?

301
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:17,130
How are you expecting us to get our food, idiot?!

302
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,130
That's right!

303
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,702
People like him should just go swim in the sea!

304
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:22,921
Shut up and just get it already!

305
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:27,509
Fine!

306
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:28,719
Fine!

307
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,977
You don't have to shout at us!

308
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:32,681
We're getting it! We're gonna get it!

309
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:33,599
We're getting it! We're gonna get it!

310
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:44,318
Hey, it's sinking! It's gonna sink!

311
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:00,281
In the past, I used to worry about every little detail.

312
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:01,251
I feel so dumb for doing so.

313
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:03,311
I feel so dumb for doing so.

314
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:19,895
See ye.

315
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:21,980
I'll be taking this.

316
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,107
I don't have to return it, do I?

317
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:24,775
I don't have to return it, do I?

318
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:24,816
I don't have to return it, do I?

319
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:25,609
Nope.

320
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,905
Try if you dare, bastard.

321
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:30,280
Try if you dare, bastard.

322
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,825
Hey! Remember now!

323
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,918
For this is the fighting sea restaurant, Baratie!

324
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:42,084
What an annoying bunch.

325
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,670
They're really nice people.

326
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,088
Next time we meet,

327
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,423
I wonder if they'll let me join 'em again?

328
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:31,216
I wonder if they'll let me join 'em again?

329
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:46,631
I don't know if I'll even get a chance to.

330
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,620
I want to be free!

331
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,449
Bellemere-san!

1
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,625
It is that!

2
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:56,158
I NEVER HAD THINK Of THAT!!

3
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,090
Davy Back Fight, the final match.

4
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,558
The intense combat enters the captains…

5
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,425
is finally with its apogee.

6
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:17,291
Luffy!

7
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:22,291
I will fight for my companions…

8
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,625
UNTIL DEATH!!

9
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:37,100
PROUD COMBAT!
THE FINAL DECISIVE ONE!

10
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:42,024
It was still raised thanks to its incredible will!

11
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,024
Luffy with the straw hat!

12
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:45,424
With each time it is with ground…

13
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:46,625
Luffy.

14
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:49,425
With each time it is with ground, it is raised!

15
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:55,158
It IS WHAT YOUR PROBLEM, BROTHEL?!

16
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,225
Luffy!

17
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,557
It has evil to hold upright!

18
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,025
Luffy!

19
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:04,090
It suffocates…

20
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,825
What a man!

21
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:11,158
But its eyes always shine and it is raised unceasingly!

22
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,690
By regard for his/her companions!

23
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,758
Yes, it is that Davy Back Fight!

24
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:22,958
My eyes are full with tears! I see there nothing any more!

25
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,891
Luffy!

26
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,490
It is too much!

27
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,825
Dumbs!

28
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:36,290
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

29
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,625
Crowd acclaims Luffy!

30
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:45,025
Y-a it already have before a rival
able to hold head in Oyabin like that?!

31
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,624
The guy…

32
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,558
WHY YOU ENCOURAGE the ENEMY?!

33
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,890
Oyabin… Oyabin…

34
00:03:55,891 --> 00:04:00,558
Oyabin! Oyabin! Oyabin!

35
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:04,158
Look at well, that will be finished soon.

36
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,891
You cannot flee with this kind of displacement.

37
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:18,624
Shit, it does not have even enough any more of force to flee!

38
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,625
I cannot see Luffy in this state any more!

39
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,025
Now, I will finish some.

40
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,091
Oyabin attacks!

41
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,358
Initially it slows down the boulet de canon…

42
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,157
By using the speed of the boulet de canon…

43
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,358
My megaton will undoubtedly put KB to you!

44
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:43,357
Here it is! The ultimate attack of Oyabin
“the overlapped boulet de canon”!

45
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,191
It will complete it with Foxy Fighter!

46
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:50,391
Luffy! You received the ray a little earlier than the ball!

47
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,725
Dodge it as soon as you can move!

48
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,524
I can move!

49
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:03,258
Straw hat was released from the effect of the ray!

50
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:04,525
Useless!

51
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:06,225
You will not go nowhere!

52
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,591
Luffy! Caution!

53
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,291
Take that, it is a gift.

54
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:21,757
It is finished!

55
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:25,025
All the attacks were right of Straw hat!

56
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,891
Luffy!

57
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:36,758
He! Doesn't Ca go a little too much far there?

58
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:46,825
I… it… it… it was still raised!

59
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,425
How?!

60
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,291
I gained.

61
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:14,425
WHAT?!

62
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,891
YOU HOLD HARDLY UPRIGHT!

63
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:22,891
If you do not give up, I will strike you until
what you can be raised never again!

64
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:39,224
INCREDIBLE!

65
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:43,358
It is the most violent exchange which
one saw during the combat!

66
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,825
Luffy, smashes it!

67
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,558
Beat it!

68
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:50,625
Incredible! What a incredible rain of blows!

69
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:09,991
What?

70
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,458
It was what that?

71
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,991
They do not move any more.

72
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,441
Straw hat is with ground…

73
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,707
NOT, the only one which bulge is Straw hat!

74
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,175
How is that done?

75
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:42,507
Shit.

76
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,575
Why?

77
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:46,175
Oyabin!

78
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,040
A mirror!

79
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,108
A piece of mirror fell
hand of Straw hat!

80
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:59,375
It was wedged in my cut afro.
That comes from the mirror of your part to the idiot.

81
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:02,975
Dumb!

82
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,375
Impossible…

83
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:44,741
Still eight seconds…

84
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:49,741
It is possible that…

85
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,275
Sept.

86
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,575
What?

87
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:56,375
Six…

88
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:59,341
Oyabin!

89
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,808
Five!

90
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,674
What you made?

91
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:10,408
To go, let us hope all together!

92
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:11,274
Four!

93
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:11,940
What?

94
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,875
Ouais, that with the funny air!

95
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,608
Three!

96
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,075
Two!

97
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,608
One!

98
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:34,108
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

99
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:41,108
MUGIWARA-TEAM

100
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,208
Three!

101
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,541
Two!

102
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,075
One!

103
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,275
Zero!!!

104
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,740
Géniaaaaaal!

105
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:01,941
Luffy!

106
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,941
Oyabin!

107
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,541
Oyabin flies away with far!

108
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:14,475
Oyabin!

109
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:21,741
Yatta! Yatta! Yatta! Yatta!

110
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:32,675
It landed…

111
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,141
Out of the limits!

112
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,007
Davy Back Fight, final match.

113
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:43,407
The heroic battle enters the two captains…

114
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:47,340
The legend of Oyabin with its 920
consecutive victories is finished.

115
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:50,141
The winner of the combat is…

116
00:10:56,808 --> 00:11:01,541
I will not lose any of my companions…

117
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,941
SAME IF I MUST DIE ABOUT IT!

118
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:08,875
LUFFY WITH THE STRAW HAT!

119
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:13,608
Yatta!

120
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,742
Oyabin lost.

121
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,141
Foxy pirates against…

122
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,341
Foxy pirates against…

123
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:29,608
Oi, do not remain there sitted, one must go to save Oyabin!

124
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,207
Ok, I occupy myself some!

125
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,541
the crew of the Straw hat.

126
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,274
I will do it!

127
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:33,874
Move from there!

128
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,007
I go there too!

129
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:43,742
Under the orthodoxe rule of the Three-Corner-Range,
the tests of Davy Back Fight are finished!

130
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:55,342
Oyabin!

131
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:07,525
Whore, you frightened us!

132
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,325
Toi~.

133
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:13,458
Does not touch it like that!
It is seriously wounded, stunned!

134
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:15,524
You frightened us.

135
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,458
Especially with this Afro Power.

136
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:21,258
Nami-san! The capacity of the afro is immense!

137
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,792
Ah! It awakes!

138
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:27,792
H… H… hein?

139
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,125
Play… and play?

140
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:32,658
I believed that I had gained.

141
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:33,857
It was a dream?

142
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,258
Worry you, you gained ace.

143
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,525
Such an amount of better.

144
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,658
Do not worry you, I supervised you.

145
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,125
Liar…

146
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:54,458
When I think of it, I would not have any more any
raison d'être pirates if I left this crew.

147
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,525
Oyabin! You should avoid moving.

148
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,124
Hey Straw hat!

149
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:05,924
Bastard! How oses you
to destroy my record of invincibility?!

150
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,258
Oyabin!

151
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:11,058
Played well, brother!

152
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,124
Oyabin!

153
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,192
Oyabin!

154
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,125
Yo, Oyabin!

155
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,725
Oyabin!

156
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,658
Be to you idiot or what?

157
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,857
Like the rule says it…

158
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,391
hurry and take 500 men!

159
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:34,725
Yes, the last transaction must be decided.

160
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,725
Chopper and Robin!

161
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:46,658
Thank you… I… I am so happy…

162
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:50,057
, I hold return this to you.

163
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,858
Initially it chose these deux-là of course.

164
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,858
Who will be the following? Chosen!

165
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:59,592
Give me the pirate flag.

166
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,458
WHAT?!

167
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,258
It is impossible!

168
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:06,325
You hope to seize our pride?

169
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,058
I do not want the sail.

170
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:10,658
You without, isn't this cannot sail any more?

171
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,391
What a compassion!

172
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,991
But, the symbol is above.

173
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:18,258
One will be able to use it never again.

174
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:22,258
Stop talking cock and take all!

175
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:26,391
Ok. Then I will take just the symbol.

176
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:29,658
I will make new.

177
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,992
I will thus not need to take your veil.

178
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,791
Straw hat… you are too…

179
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,925
Finished!

180
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,792
Which horror…

181
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,258
They seem to appreciate!

182
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:43,725
BURST!

183
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,125
Wait a little!

184
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:49,792
There remain to you always 497 novel members to be chosen.

185
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,524
I want anything else.

186
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,991
The rules are the rules.

187
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:57,925
You must choose 497 moreover of them, it is all.

188
00:14:57,992 --> 00:14:59,791
Hein? I do not have the choice?

189
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,658
Be to you idiot? Of course that not!

190
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:03,992
Luffy!

191
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,192
Isn't the orders of the captain are undeniable?

192
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:09,191
Yes, in this case…

193
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,592
Ah, I see.

194
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:14,458
What? What?

195
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:16,392
I see, I included/understood.

196
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,125
Thus I will choose…

197
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:22,824
You there!

198
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:23,924
Me?

199
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,792
Yes, of you until…

200
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,057
to you.

201
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:33,857
Me?

202
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,192
Does Ca make how much?

203
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,524
There are 500 members.

204
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:41,591
If there remains only Oyabin,
Hamburger-san, and Porch-chan…

205
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:47,191
Oh, that made to pile 497 people, Luffy Captain.

206
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:48,658
Yosh! It is decided!

207
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:55,858
Winners, the crew of the Straw hat!
Davy Back Fight is officially finished!

208
00:15:55,858 --> 00:16:00,058
The new crew of the straw hat is trained!

209
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:03,924
But one cannot sail on
Merry with so much of people.

210
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:08,191
Ben, one has that to sail with
sexy Foxy and to follow them.

211
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,058
Ouais, it is not badly.

212
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:17,191
What do you tell? 
Sexy Foxy is MY boat!

213
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,057
“Your boat”?

214
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:22,458
You cannot sail with if
large ship with only 3 people.

215
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:24,392
Impossible.

216
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,258
It is impossible.

217
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,591
Very well, the guy!

218
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,924
Make good voyage, former Boss!

219
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,657
Does not catch cold!

220
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:37,925
Do not forget to brush the teeth!

221
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,992
Oi, Straw hat!

222
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:45,925
You will pay me that…!

223
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:48,925
How long will they still amuse us?

224
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,125
Yosh, my comrades!

225
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,925
I will give the first mission to
new pirates of the Straw hat!

226
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,925
Achieve it with brilliance!

227
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,124
Would be sure!

228
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,791
Gomu Oyabin!

229
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,925
You ARE TRANSFERED!

230
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,657
Transfered?

231
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:08,992
Ouais, transfered.

232
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,925
Isn't the orders of the Captain are irrefutable?

233
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,591
You can turn over to your first crew,
head of puzzle or no matter who.

234
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:18,658
In any event, you are transfered!

235
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,192
It is all.

236
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:23,057
Former Boss, await us!

237
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:26,658
One is always of Foxy Pirates.

238
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:28,458
They are like mercenaries.

239
00:17:35,258 --> 00:17:37,925
It would be said that it is finished.

240
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:44,258
Do not worry you, they gained.

241
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,125
Well, well. I will not use any more stilts.

242
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:53,525
Let us find the village, it does not matter
the number of years that will take to us.

243
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,525
You!

244
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:03,992
I have boot to them the bottom.

245
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,858
You are amoché enough.

246
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,458
It is always like that.

247
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,058
Thank you.

248
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:25,658
I see, it is thus for that you accepted the challenge.

249
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:27,992
Lastly, you would have accepted in any event.

250
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,925
He, it is malicious that!

251
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,992
What occurs?

252
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,658
Be to you which you?

253
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,992
I return you the question!

254
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:49,991
This… This thing spoke!

255
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:52,591
It is not “this thing”,
it is a taaaaaaaupe.

256
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:55,792
“Do Taaaaaaaupe”, you want to say… mole?

257
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:59,258
I' m has champion!

258
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:00,458
Yes!

259
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,191
Still an odd guy…

260
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,125
Which kind of champion?

261
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,125
Content that you it requests!

262
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:12,992
I am the champion of digging of holes,
who personally defied old the tenant du titer.

263
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:17,925
You have just destroyed the house of Ossan with
stilts, what makes of you a champion?!

264
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,925
Ossan with the stilts?

265
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,792
You see? It is a taaaaaaaupe.

266
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:35,792
Ittonto, soon I will try the record
world of the largest stilts.

267
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:44,992
It is far, but I will return in 2 or 3 days.
With this mole, you will not be alone. Will Ca go?

268
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:50,724
Of agreement, but tries to return
with the championship!

269
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:55,192
Of course, I promise it to you.

270
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:59,258
It could be that you would be…

271
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:01,058
It is me.

272
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,524
Large father!

273
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,192
Ittonto!
Large father!

274
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:08,058
I missed you! I missed you so much!

275
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,792
You ace really grown since the last time that I saw you.

276
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,592
Afflicted you to have anxious.

277
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,658
They is the peeeetit-wire of ossan?

278
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:25,392
It is with the words “I want to re-examine Grand Father”
in my head, which I started to dig.

279
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:31,125
But rather quickly it became my
objective to be the best digger.

280
00:20:31,858 --> 00:20:33,792
And, champion?

281
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:37,258
Aim at the ground!

282
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:41,258
Be to you exactly like Ossan with the stilts…

283
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,657
Oh? Really?

284
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,058
One does not compliment oneself!

285
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:49,992
Say, if you are the hole, you would have
to be able to join your village not?

286
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:56,057
You ace of the Ossan chance.

287
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,792
Ah, I do not know how you to thank.

288
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,058
Do not make any you.

289
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:07,792
Thank you with you, Born-san, I completed my true objective!

290
00:21:10,658 --> 00:21:14,192
I will never forget what you did for me!

291
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,457
Thank you!

292
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,457
Take care of you!

293
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:24,992
You too. I wish you good luck.

294
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:28,658
Well, allons-y…

295
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:31,125
Was Nami, the Log reloaded?

296
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,192
Yes, they is good.

297
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,592
In this case, allons-y.

298
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:36,992
Ouais.

299
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,858
As quickly let us find an engineer naval as possible!

300
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:46,792
Yosh, the guy!

301
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,325
Quickly let us find an engineer naval!

302
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:52,992
OUAIS!

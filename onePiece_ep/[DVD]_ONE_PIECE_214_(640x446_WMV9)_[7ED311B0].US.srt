1
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,800
What a speed!

2
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:09,800
To this pace it soon will catch up with Porch-chan!

3
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,000
The wall.

4
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,065
It of it is magnificiently drawn!

5
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,733
It is nothing any more but one question of seconds
before it catches up with Porch-chan!

6
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,466
It is already there?

7
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,133
Take that!

8
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,465
Here, am my councils and that will go.

9
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:41,799
They is good!!

10
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Remain Luffy upright!!

11
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:57,700
APOGEE Of an EXPLOSIVE RACE!
TO GAIN THE FINAL ROUND!

12
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:03,133
Go! Still an effort! Fight!

13
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,466
That emotions…

14
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,200
They is good! Be to you there almost!

15
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,666
Yosh! I am upright!

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Hold the blow, Usopp!

17
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,800
What a speed! Too much extremely!!

18
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,266
One will not lose!

19
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,932
Extraordinary! The moment of front, Luffy with
straw hat did not even hold upright!

20
00:03:55,933 --> 00:04:00,266
Now it patinates as quickly as
Chiqicheetah, however at the head!

21
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Shit!

22
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,533
Shit, I forgot to say to him how to turn!

23
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,400
Luffy with the straw hat still left the track!

24
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,933
Here it is excluded from this sleeve!

25
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,933
(It is really not the moment…)

26
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
Ca is badly…

27
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:43,000
The Chiqicheetah pirate carries out the race with 4 turns!

28
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:51,000
Length-nose, clings to me and sinks!

29
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:58,333
The blow of the lasso of the archeologist Nico Robin!

30
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
Will it succeed in taking the top?

31
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,933
Iyan… This woman!

32
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,733
Porch-chan, lets to me deal with that!

33
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:28,666
Chiqicheetah has just passed the third speed!

34
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,333
He! It left the track!

35
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,133
It did not leave it!
It remained in the air!

36
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:44,266
The complaint of the burning Sanji coach will not succeed!

37
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,133
They will not arrive there without my assistance.

38
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,866
Oh not!

39
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,266
Do not try to struggle.

40
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:58,200
That would do nothing but tighten my pressure.

41
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,532
Useless!

42
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:07,266
I am a mollusc, that does not do anything to me.

43
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,333
Played Juubei well!

44
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,800
Finished playing.

45
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,265
Shit, Robin it is made trap!

46
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:20,665
Idiotic He of coach,

47
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:25,000
if one does not stop this Chiqicheetah, one will lose.

48
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,733
I know it well!

49
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,666
Chiqi… cheetah… chiq…

50
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,732
perhaps that…

51
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,266
Ossan!

52
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,800
The old man with the horse, be to you there?!

53
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,266
It is of me that one speaks?

54
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:45,000
Where you ace found the funny one of kiwi, which you spun ace with Luffy?

55
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,599
But what can that to you foutre?

56
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,532
Your mouth!

57
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,400
Ossan, answer, that is urgent!

58
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,733
Ah that? On this tree with the interlaced branches!

59
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,665
Quickly head of cactus, brings back for me a branch of kiwi!

60
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,932
It is like that you requests a service?

61
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,400
It is perhaps our only means of stopping this type!

62
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,933
A means of stopping it?

63
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,866
Yes, hurries!

64
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:09,799
Qu… What you made?

65
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,465
Take Shelly!

66
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,600
Here!

67
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:21,266
I am unaware of if it will go but…

68
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,066
one will have at least tested.

69
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,465
Already 4 minutes…

70
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,800
Chiqicheetha is at the head with an advance of 13 turns!

71
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,399
4 minutes and 30 seconds, now…

72
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,533
It with maintaining 15 turns in advance!

73
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,266
The situation is desperate for Mugiwara Dangers!

74
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,933
It puts to time this dumb of it!

75
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,066
It is that?

76
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,199
4 minutes and 50 seconds!

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,866
In 10 seconds, Foxy Devils will have gained the part!

78
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,733
I will not arrive there…

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,466
5 seconds…

80
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,200
What does it occur?

81
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,933
Oh, it is…

82
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,266
What it arrived at Chiqicheetah?!

83
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,732
Chiqicheetah left the track at 5 seconds of the end!

84
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,732
What a finish!

85
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:52,266
Mugiwara Dangers gain an unhoped-for victory!

86
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,266
Chiqicheetah… Iyan…

87
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,266
WHAT!?

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
Round of applause-Banzaï!

89
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,265
Why?

90
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,000
But, why that!?

91
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,066
Certain kiwis push on the silver plated vine…

92
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:16,399
I intended to say that the cats
fall in extase in front of the strong one…

93
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,600
odor released by the silver plated vine.

94
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,599
The cheetah being same family as the cats…

95
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,333
I thus had this idea.

96
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:28,400
Then it is for that it reniflait Luffy.

97
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,733
Undoubtedly.

98
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,800
Very impressive, Main Cock.

99
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,733
If you it known as…

100
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,466
It was less one…

101
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,600
Mugiwara Dangers gained a point…

102
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
but Foxy Devils are not acknowledged not overcome!

103
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,465
Pas le time to enjoy your victory,

104
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,400
the fourth handle soon will start!

105
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:59,532
The Point-Getters are,
The historian Nico Robin…

106
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,799
against Juubei the man-fish.

107
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,133
Two master cards!

108
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:07,733
Luffy, when you arrive at the curve…

109
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,932
I have measuring rod the trick, that will go.

110
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:13,066
Will that go!? You ace considering how you patinas…?

111
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,133
Zoro, do not make any you.

112
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,000
You said to me to observe how the others patinate, not?

113
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,066
Hein?

114
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,933
It will still use its perfume, it is sure.

115
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:27,533
Ah! Fact of shitting, this dirty perfume.

116
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:28,799
This head of breeze block…

117
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,933
Oyabin!

118
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,266
Usopp, listening that!

119
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,900
You be an unpleasant girl…

120
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,066
Good idea, not true?

121
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,332
It would be said that Nami the navigatrice scheme something.

122
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,999
It has the glance even more cheating than Oyabin!

123
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
It is which that you treat of cheating!?

124
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,532
You…

125
00:10:53,783 --> 00:11:00,750
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

126
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:08,150
MUGIWARA-TEAM

127
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,183
C is the hour of the fourth handle!

128
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,383
You heard ace?

129
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,117
Loans…

130
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:23,450
LEAVE!

131
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,116
Be not made illusions.

132
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:34,183
Perhaps Chiqicheetah beats me, but I remain fast.

133
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,850
The 20 seconds passed, defense can leave!

134
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:44,383
Will that go for Luffy?

135
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,249
Super!

136
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,717
Be the best for you, Luffy!!

137
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,316
No matter what you make,

138
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:10,850
you will finish victim of my Mucha Caramente!

139
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,917
Certainly not!

140
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,316
Ooohh! It finally overcame somebody…

141
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:26,917
Luffy with the straw hat beat Juubei!

142
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:30,717
Sink, Robin! I deal with that one!

143
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,250
Included/understood.

144
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,450
Where my stick passed?!

145
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,850
Afflicted

146
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,183
Iyan! You are caught for whom?!

147
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:09,450
Sitted remainder. It is for your good.

148
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,717
Yes!

149
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:14,849
Fantastic!

150
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,517
Mugiwara Dangers control the race completely!

151
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,483
I will show them…

152
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,783
Hamburger.

153
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,449
Prepare in “Dull Dash”!

154
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,317
Yes.

155
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:28,783
Usopp, it from goes away.

156
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,582
Lends to launch the plan of the “reversal to 180 degrees”?

157
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,690
Ok.

158
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,316
Nasty face of puzzle!

159
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,850
You still make the clown?!

160
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,850
Head of puzzle… Clown…

161
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,983
He lies! You are fantastic, Oyabin-chan!

162
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,982
You really believe it? Species of imbecile!

163
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:03,316
Not I am serious! I admire you! I love you!

164
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:06,316
It is obvious that she lies! Deformed head of puzzle!

165
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:08,116
Do not criticize my head…

166
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:09,183
Be brilliant for you!

167
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,116
Head of puzzle!

168
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,183
Be brilliant for you!

169
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,382
Head of puzzle!

170
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:13,449
I love you!

171
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,783
Old idiot!

172
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,117
Head of puzzle!

173
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:19,917
Nami, you must continue to praise it!

174
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,349
I can about it more…

175
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,183
my belly is tied with each word which I pronounce…

176
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:26,783
Usopp, replaces me…

177
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,717
How they dare… Bastards!!

178
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,583
I do not manage to say good of him…

179
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,649
Tant pis, allons-y à fond !

180
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,316
Ouais!

181
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:39,583
Be brilliant for you! Head of puzzle! Be brilliant for you!
Head of puzzle! Be brilliant for you! Head of puzzle…

182
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,717
It cannot use Noro Noro Beam any more!

183
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:45,849
Our Oyabin will collapse it under
power of their words!?

184
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,183
Time remaining is reduced!

185
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,917
… Be brilliant for You! Head of puzzle! Be brilliant for you!
Head of puzzle! Be brilliant for you! Head of puzzle!

186
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:02,850
Head of puzzle!

187
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,382
Be brilliant for you!

188
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:05,450
Head of puzzle!

189
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,117
And the sleeve is finished!

190
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:13,783
Mugiwara Dangers have completely
dominated this fourth handle!

191
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:25,217
The two teams are entitled to 5 minutes
rest before the ultimate handle!

192
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,583
How I could fall into their poor trap!?

193
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,249
Who would have believed that they would hold
until the final sleeve…

194
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,916
Listen,

195
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:35,249
one should not lose any more!

196
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,983
One will use “the Plan”, one will undoubtedly gain!

197
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:39,449
We will use it?

198
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,250
Ouais! One will gain!

199
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:45,049
And now, here is finally the final round!

200
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,916
Place on the starting line!

201
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:52,782
Oh! With share the Point-Getter
no Foxy Devil N is on the track.

202
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:56,650
Perhaps it prepares its special blow?!

203
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,317
Special blow?

204
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,649
It is still its ray pourrave, it is that?

205
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,050
Iyan, you said it.

206
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:07,849
Its Noro Noro Beam will undoubtedly touch its target!

207
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,250
All the plan turns around that…

208
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,183
When you include/understand, it will be too late.

209
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,983
But about what do you speak, saw you well the last round?

210
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,582
There is our plan of the reversal to 180 degrees.

211
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,917
Luffy, do not make any you and rolls thoroughly!

212
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,117
Ok! Count on me!

213
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,917
Go, with your marks…

214
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:29,916
Loans?

215
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:30,783
LEAVE!

216
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:37,516
What!? Already?

217
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:44,117
Head of puzzle! Be brilliant for you! Head of puzzle!
Be brilliant for you! Head of puzzle! Be brilliant for you!

218
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:52,250
Here it is! Noro Noro Beam with fast shooting!

219
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,582
Why…

220
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,850
doesn't the plan of the reversal to 180 degrees go?

221
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,917
You known as something?

222
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,183
It has earplugs!!

223
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:06,049
Mugiwara Dangers are in the soup!

224
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,183
It is not our Oyabin for nothing!

225
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,583
Shit!

226
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,049
Hein? It diverted Noro thingummy-trick?

227
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,183
Iyan, you noticed ace?

228
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,782
Noro Noro Beam does not go on Girarin.

229
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:28,117
Ah yes? And why thus?

230
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,716
It is one…

231
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,717
secrecy!

232
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,917
It is a secrecy, it is for that?

233
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:40,450
Then it is for that you ace left the track.

234
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:46,183
Yes, Thus only your fellow-members
will be touched by the ray!

235
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,450
You will not even be able you
to serve as us like shield.

236
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:53,717
It was that the plan? One is badly!

237
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,450
The 20 seconds passed. Go!

238
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,650
Nami-san!

239
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,717
In the thousand!

240
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,649
Nami the navigatrice and Usopp the marksman…

241
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,050
were taken in Noro Noro Beam!

242
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,250
Luffy, pay attention behind you!

243
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,450
Luffy with the straw hat was also touched!

244
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,983
Will they be able to overcome?

245
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,717
Then it is you the last?

246
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,450
I should not run the risk.

247
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,850
If I am touched by this ray,

248
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,917
there will be no more average to gain.

249
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,116
What does it occur?

250
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:57,517
Nico Robin of Mugiwara Dangers,
who supported the effort a long time,

251
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,982
the sponge would thus have thrown?

252
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:04,183
It leaves already the part,
whereas there remains still a minute?

253
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:08,050
The effect of Noro Noro Beam lasts 30 seconds.

254
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,317
It must avoid the other rays.

255
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,517
I am sure that Luffy will arrive there.

256
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,983
I should not fail.

257
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,317
I should benefit from this chance.

258
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,183
Robin-chan, that is there?

259
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:25,650
While putting to me there I am with the shelter of the ray, not?

260
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,850
Robin-chan…

261
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,782
More than 40 seconds.

262
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:34,783
Foxy Devils carry out of 3 turns.

263
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:43,650
I transform you into two of tension
with my Noro Mani, just if.

264
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,317
Luffy with the straw hat, one had fun up to now,

265
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,117
but it is time to finish some.

266
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,516
More than 30 seconds.

267
00:19:57,517 --> 00:20:02,183
If Luffy with the straw hat is still touched
by the ray their defeat will be certain!

268
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,583
It is the moment!

269
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:22,650
Shit!

270
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:25,383
Roll, Luffy! Time presses!

271
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,517
Yosh!

272
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,317
More that 20 seconds!

273
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,717
Come by here…

274
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,117
You prefer them been useful believed…

275
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:51,517
or fried?

276
00:21:01,517 --> 00:21:03,383
More that 10 seconds!

277
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,982
The speed of Luffy to the straw hat is surrealist!

278
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:08,917
It would be said that it will gain the victory!

279
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:15,183
It is… It is not possible!!

280
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,850
Oyabin tasted with its own capacities!

281
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,450
More that 5 seconds!

282
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:29,717
A sword which does not slice…

283
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,583
that does not frighten me!!

284
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:44,717
What a unexpected victory of Mugiwara Dangers!

285
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,583
YATTA!!

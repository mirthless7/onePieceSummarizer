1
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:36,470
On the way towards a new adventure! Apis, the curious little girl

2
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,450
This light…

3
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,240
indicate the site of the entry of Large Line!

4
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,370
I want to find where Al Blue hides!

5
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,670
To become the Lord of the Pirates!

6
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,540
To become the best sword-man of the world!

7
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,160
Me, I want to draw a chart of the world!

8
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,850
Me…

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,590
I want to become a honest warrior of the sea!

10
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,860
It left for…

11
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,199
Large Line!!

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,309
Large Line!!

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,419
Large Line!!

14
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,529
Large Line!!

15
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:24,639
LARGE Line!!

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:24,749
LARGE LIne!!

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:24,859
LARGE LINe!!

18
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,600
LARGE LINE!!

19
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,530
He, I lead you to eat.

20
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,610
He, where are you? Where you hid?

21
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,550
He! Not the sorrow to flee, there is a large storm outside!

22
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,510
Leave your hiding-place, good blood!

23
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,920
I do not stop repeating you that you will never escape from here!

24
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,350
If you were held quiet, you would not be in this state!

25
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,459
Whore! Release me!!

26
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,449
He, does not agitate you like that!

27
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,110
Leave, leave me me…

28
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,709
Do not let this young girl escape!

29
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,409
Excavate all the ship!

30
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,430
Catch it and bring back it here!

31
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,490
It is only one child, made to him not evil.

32
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,200
She is there!

33
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,030
Capture it!!

34
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,699
They is dangerous up there!

35
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,940
Go down from there immediately!

36
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,570
Do not touch with the veils during a storm!

37
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,520
Protect me, Ryuji!

38
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,090
What will it make?

39
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,720
They is too dangerous! Return here!

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,740
Bandage imbeciles!!

41
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,590
What is written in this report/ratio?

42
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,020
This girl is probably the key to obtain Ryuukotsu which I seek for a long time!

43
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,020
Ryuukotsu:Os of dragons

44
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,280
Did you carry out what you did, band of inefficient?

45
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,880
Erik!

46
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,380
With your service.

47
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,900
It is the key of the elixir of youth, us will not let it draw some from this manner.

48
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,430
Chosen one of my fleets, finds it and brings back the-me costs that costs!

49
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,820
I did not think that to seek young girls belonged to our contract.

50
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,670
I will pay you as much as you will want!

51
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:04,660
I urged you to supervise this small! Or would you prefer to drop our only evidence?

52
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,000
Go, leave to seek it!

53
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,820
I included/understood. If it is large Nelson Royale which requires it of me…

54
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,870
Nami! We did not arrive yet at Grand Line?

55
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,110
We have started from Loguetown only for two days.

56
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,800
It will still take us a few days before arriving over there. Patience!

57
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,940
Yes!

58
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,990
What a beautiful day! To believe that this storm forever take place.

59
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,100
What is it?

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,350
He! I see a band of birds with starboard!

61
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,739
Birds?

62
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,030
Yes, but on the sea, I see something floating…

63
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,359
What can that be well?

64
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,400
Perhaps a fish?

65
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,700
Or a boat? But that rather has the air of a large fish…

66
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,390
I intended to say that the birds fly on the surface of the ocean as soon as there is full of fish.

67
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,350
What?

68
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,199
Luffy, catches we-in for the lunch.

69
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,440
Included/understood!

70
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,149
Oh, what a to launch!

71
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,870
One can call that a true knack.

72
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,030
Caught!

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,809
It is enormous!

74
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,220
Played well, Luffy!

75
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,440
Wait a little… How it is stopped?

76
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,259
Ah! Afflicted, Zoro.

77
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,610
Moron!!

78
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,270
That one…

79
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,770
One day, I will kill it!

80
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,080
He, come to see… It was not a fish!

81
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,519
It is a young girl…

82
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,319
Hein? A siren? It is where its tail?

83
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,610
Does He, you… in what it resemble a siren?

84
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,370
Why a little girl was all alone on this boat?

85
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,639
With

86
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:10,939
Have

87
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,239
IEA

88
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,259
IEA!!

89
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,310
You finally awoke! You have the air in form…

90
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,270
Do you have some share badly?

91
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,889
I bet that you are hungry,

92
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,910
I am in the train of you mijoter a good small soup.

93
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,409
Lucky!

94
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,620
You are a shipwrecked woman or something of the kind?

95
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,800
How are you called?

96
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,280
For asking for the name of a person, it would be necessary perhaps to initially to present you.

97
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,290
You are right. I am called Nami.

98
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,459
That which prepares your soup, it is Sanji.

99
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,080
Yo!

100
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,870
That with a horrible head and a stringcourse, it is Zoro.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,949
Your mouth.

102
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,510
The unconscious one which does not move over there any more, it is Usopp. And…

103
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,130
I am Luffy,

104
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,610
the Captain of this pirate ship!

105
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,500
Hein? Pirates?

106
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,580
We move towards Grand Line!

107
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,980
What doesn't go?

108
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,480
It does not move any more.

109
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,479
What will one make this girl of it?

110
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,430
Euh, since you speak about it, that one will make some?

111
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,260
One will think of it tomorrow.

112
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,910
Why?

113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,799
Why, why, why me?

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,630
Already that it was not easy to flee with these dumbs of the Navy,

115
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,410
now I find myself trapped on a pirate vessel!

116
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,940
It is a joke…

117
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,700
Perhaps should I eat something before reflecting?

118
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,650
IEA…

119
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
Still you, Luffy.

120
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,369
How much time should I repeat it to you?

121
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,000
Be held quiet the next time!

122
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,010
What do you make?

123
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,830
Delicious!

124
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,660
He, I did it to you especially then,

125
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,179
any more my refrigerator does not approach you!

126
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,620
But, I had the flagstone!

127
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,750
Holà, that does occur? You want nothing to eat whole?

128
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,900
Do not worry you, I did not put a poison inside…

129
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,320
If you do not eat anything, this goinfre soon will take your share.

130
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,640
Good, since you do not want any, I will take tone…

131
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,820
Not!!

132
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,209
Oh, they is delicious!

133
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,460
Obviously, I indicated Sanji like our personal chief.

134
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,650
I never ate something of also good!

135
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,449
Lastly, she smiles!

136
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,629
Nami-San!

137
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,400
Do Luffy, you still eat?

138
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,520
I did not have to eat enough today…

139
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,939
You had two barrels of food only for you.

140
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,220
Good Ah?

141
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,060
You were afraid when you knew that one was pirates, is not this?

142
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,310
In fact…

143
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,300
Your reaction concerning the pirates is normal nowadays.

144
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,779
You will not sell to me?

145
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,539
You believed that one…

146
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,189
Did everyone have to appear alarming to you, then?

147
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,980
With your face, it is normal!

148
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,250
Why you drew me the cheek?

149
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,500
He, stop your gamineries both!

150
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,120
If you want to still be useful yourself, does not hesitate, Miss…

151
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,110
With final, it of boat which you expected, isn't this was not the pirate kind?

152
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,290
Slacken.

153
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,949
I still want some!

154
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,869
Yes, I prepare you that.

155
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,339
Me too!

156
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,609
Manage all alone, imbecile!

157
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,950
Malicious…

158
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,320
What?

159
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,020
He, that does occur in bottom?

160
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,910
I prepare the breakfast!

161
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,530
He, everyone, the breakfast is been useful!

162
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,469
Oh, to eat?

163
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,210
To which kind of food one will have right?

164
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,000
Euh… You did that all alone?

165
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,890
Food has, how to say… a particular appearance.

166
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,889
Good appetite!

167
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,959
In addition to me to have saved, you nourished me.

168
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,630
Therefore, from now, I will make all my possible to come you to assistance!

169
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,599
Like that, you will be able to help us… Thank you.

170
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,950
You are sure that it is edible?

171
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,050
Stop making the child and eats!

172
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,149
You believe that they is good for us to eat that?

173
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,910
I find that delicious!

174
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,050
Yes, yes… I am sure that it is only the appearance which poses problem.

175
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,550
Really?

176
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,080
It is really as disgusting as that?

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,219
That pricks!!

178
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,120
It is what that? I had to put seasoning too much!

179
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,150
Ouais, in fact things arrive.

180
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,230
For the next one, tries to pay attention.

181
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,020
He, this girl was given thoroughly to cook you that, then do not leave a crumb of it!

182
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,870
Silence! You will make him regret, this girl…

183
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,510
Ah yes, how are you called with the fact?

184
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,950
Apis! I am called Apis!

185
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,280
The feelings of Apis-Chan are concerned!

186
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,810
I will not let any among you leave would not be this that a crumb!

187
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,270
Nami-San, I will prepare you something to eat later.

188
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,459
Thank you.

189
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,690
Afflicted.

190
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,730
To make the kitchen is not really a field where I excel…

191
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,989
But if I can help you in one way or another!

192
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,350
Do not make any you. One will be already reassured if you have fun well here.

193
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,980
Let to me deal with the meals, there is full with other drudgeries which you can make in the place.

194
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,980
Really? I adore his kitchen!

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,259
You…

196
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,140
You will be accustomed to force, I to you it guaranteed.

197
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,270
It is true… Apis, why were you all alone with the right in the middle of the ocean?

198
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,870
I escaped from a ship of the Navy…

199
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,619
A ship of the Navy?

200
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,840
During the night of storm, three days ago.

201
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,540
You were installed on this small boat in full storm?

202
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,950
You had to see some of all the colors?

203
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,670
Now, say to us what you did over there.

204
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,920
The fact that you were to flee means that

205
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,480
you as a guest on this ship, amn't I right did not travel?

206
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,720
Moreover, the Navy does not waste time to deal with no matter whom.

207
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,020
In fact… Euh…

208
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,919
What? You are criminal?

209
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,970
Of course that not! You see me committing a crime?

210
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,860
I did not do anything… but… I cannot say my reasons.

211
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,329
Why that?

212
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,719
Leave it quiet.

213
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,830
It must certainly have good reasons.

214
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,530
You are right.

215
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,960
But you could say to us at least from where you come?

216
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,040
Yes. I live on the island of Gunkan.

217
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,660
The island of Gunkan?

218
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,520
You know?

219
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,439
Not, lets check to me.

220
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,659
Why it is called the island of Gunkan?

221
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,620
It thus is called because the silhouette of the island resembles a navire de guerre.

222
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,620
Gunkan:Navire de guerre

223
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,979
He, interesting!

224
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,480
Ah, here!

225
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,279
It is close to Large Line.

226
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,449
In this moment, we are some share here, then…

227
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,300
We are not very far.

228
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,660
What do you wish?

229
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,930
You want to return on the island of Gunkan?

230
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,070
We had envisaged to go straight in direction of Large Line, but…

231
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,180
Me?

232
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,820
You already saved me and I know that will annoy you but…

233
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,150
I want to return at home!

234
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,650
Forgiveness, I think only of me.

235
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:05,390
If you let me go up on board a boat which goes there, I think of being able to clear up me.

236
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,990
You cause us really problems!

237
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,230
Tell me what a kind of ship would like to approach a pirate vessel well!

238
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,680
Indeed…

239
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,350
But, you know the island is not so far only that from our way.

240
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,709
Our voyage is not urgent either.

241
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,520
Hein?

242
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,210
I am of agreement there to go and you, Capitaine?

243
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,109
Yes, that suits me.

244
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,840
Grand Line will await us.

245
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,840
It is true. Does this island really resemble a navire de guerre?

246
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,229
One would say…

247
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,389
Really?

248
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,789
You want to take me along well to the island of Gunkan?

249
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,219
Yes.

250
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,029
Super! Thank you, Luffy!

251
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,819
Super! Super!

252
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,969
I am content!

253
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,459
Thank you for all my heart!

254
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,620
You all, thank you very much!

255
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,980
To show you my gratitude, I will make the breakfast the every day!

256
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,870
Euh, it is not worthwhile…

257
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,930
Why?

258
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,790
Major!

259
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,960
Boat with 13:00!

260
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,970
It is a small caravel with a cranium on the flag!

261
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,500
Pirates?

262
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,020
To enter the jurisdiction of the Admiral Nelson…

263
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,530
They must be insane!

264
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,620
That must be a band of beginners. Drop!

265
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,960
In fact, this symbol does not belong to somebody of weak.

266
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,990
It is that of Luffy to the Straw hat, its head is put at price for 30 million Berrys.

267
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,520
One heard of him…

268
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,150
Even with all this fleet, we did not find it yet…

269
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,290
It is possible that someone else captured this girl.

270
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,720
Moreover, the fact that it is about a rather famous crew shows that

271
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,670
that would not be very intelligent of our share to be unaware of them.

272
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,030
Seize the ship!

273
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,809
Why I have a bad presentiment?

274
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,050
He, ships behind us!

275
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,709
It is not possible!

276
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,559
Ships of the Navy!!

277
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,429
Navy?

278
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,020
This time, there are not only one or two of them.

279
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,980
It rightly.

280
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,500
Moreover, that a fleet of this size in this zone makes?

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,520
What? What? What does it occur?

282
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,829
They surely come to have my head!

283
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,760
Yes, but why as many boats?

284
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,789
They must know with what a not it is difficult to beat me!

285
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,109
I am too strong!

286
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,790
You are always relaxed, yes!

287
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,049
What you ace?

288
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,430
These vessels come from the 8th division.

289
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,970
It is because of them that I am flee! What do I have to make?

290
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,509
It is it! I saw it!

291
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,680
I saw a little girl on the bridge!

292
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,630
What?

293
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,050
As I had said it to you, Major.

294
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,670
Did I wound your honor?

295
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,630
If your orders, this girl had been followed…

296
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,420
the key of the elixir of youth, Ryuukotsu, would have escaped again…

297
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,320
You do not even imagine at which point the Admiral Nelson would have been furious.

298
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,880
Prepare the guns! We will run this pirate ship!

299
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,450
Ah! They draw us above!!

300
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,140
Listen, dirty pirates! Stop your vessel immediately!

301
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,239
It is the first and the last warning!!

302
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,330
How to make to stop them?

303
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,719
What does one make Luffy? Will we get rid some?

304
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,689
Yes, it left.

305
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,710
Wait a little!

306
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,029
But why one always makes like that?

307
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,889
How do you hope to beat a whole fleet?

308
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,759
While sinking in the heap!

309
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,139
Doesn't that go?

310
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,879
One makes like that.

311
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,649
What?

312
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,389
One does not wonder to come.

313
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,559
Use the gun to cover us.

314
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,380
What? Well, let to me take care some!

315
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,089
I will be always ready if one has to flee.

316
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,140
The wind arrives. A strong wind…

317
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,550
Zoro, mets veils in the south!

318
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,570
Usopp, Sanji-Kun, turn the boat to port side!

319
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,529
Quickly!

320
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,660
Yes… Nami-San!

321
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,919
What does it occur?

322
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,890
A gust of wind approaches, we will benefit from it to flee.

323
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,800
We do not have enough lives to hold head to them.

324
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,900
That could go…

325
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,690
This small.

326
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,110
No sign of immobility!

327
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,870
Why?

328
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,230
Here it is!

329
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,549
The pirate vessel accelerated and they also changed direction!

330
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,179
What?

331
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,609
They put on the veils at the south!

332
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,749
In the south? Imbeciles!

333
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,949
They do not have any idea towards where it move!

334
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,350
Why do you hesitate, Major? Continue them!

335
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,579
He, one goes quickly!

336
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,470
Fortunately that there was wind!

337
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,740
Look at, Luffy, one is sowing the Navy!

338
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,340
Try to catch us if you can it!

339
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,320
Nothing to make, we can catch up with them!

340
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,300
A whole fleet not to succeed in capturing a small caravel. Pitiful.

341
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,259
The small boats are easier to operate!

342
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,410
I do not want to hear your dirty excuses!

343
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,870
Major, we approach this zone…

344
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,789
Major!

345
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,840
I am not deaf!

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,999
All the ships, prepare you to make half-turn!

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,840
Wait, Major. Why one stops?

348
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,909
This rate/rhythm, we would have been trapped in Calm Belt!

349
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,879
I have anything of it to make! Continue them…

350
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,409
Not!!

351
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,260
Jerk, you do not know at which point it is important…

352
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,879
This girl should not escape!

353
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,390
How will you explain it to the Admiral Nelson?

354
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,400
I am ready to assume the consequences.

355
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,560
But I will not let my men be taken with the trap of this ocean!

356
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,400
No matter what you will say, the continuation is completed here!

357
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,610
What a insolence!

358
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,699
The Navy does not follow us any more!

359
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,929
Still another victory for the Usopp captain!

360
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,079
Brilliant! Brilliant! That it is my very spit navigatrice!

361
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,920
One recognizes my Nami-San well! It can predict the arrival of the wind!

362
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,910
Euh, makes some I had a presentiment.

363
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,789
Ah! Nami-San is splendid when it is modest!

364
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,309
Good, it left for the island Gunkan!

365
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,499
Really?

366
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,599
Of course, of course!

367
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,120
Good, Gunkan here us are!

368
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,470
GO!

369
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,540
What worries you, Zoro?

370
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,969
You have the air worried since presently.

371
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,360
It is nothing… There is just an odd trick.

372
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,449
What thus?

373
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,730
Since presently, the boat does not have advanced of a hair.

374
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,660
Since you speak about it, the veils are completely deflated…

375
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,319
What takes to you, Nami?

376
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,540
Nami-San?

377
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,080
Oh not… We entered Calm Belt!

1
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,490
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,790
The man who had acquired everything in this
 world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,510
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,720
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,220
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,390
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,350
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,900
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,060
Bastard...

10
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
Are you messing with me?!

11
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,620
No, I'm impressed.

12
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,950
But if you're in such a rush, then I'll show you...

13
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,090
Witness my new-found power.

14
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,540
It's falling apart!

15
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,860
Oh, no!

16
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,540
I only meant to be half beast, but I became a full giraffe!

17
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,160
THERE'S A TALKING GIRAFFE FALLING DOWN!!

18
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,690
Kaku! Your new power is so hilarious!

19
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,730
A wolf?!

20
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,570
What is this place?! A zoo?!

21
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,790
Damn you all!

22
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,410
Enjoy the fighting powers of the Devil Fruit's ability!

23
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,740
Rankyaku!

24
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,410
Wh-What the hell?! Something's coming!

25
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,420
Amane Dachi! (Rotating Cut!)

26
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,550
This is bad!

27
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,140
Get down, Usopp!

28
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:48,740
I Won't Kick Even If I Die! Sanji's Way of Chivalry

29
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,020
I see...

30
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,720
The length...

31
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,090
In other words, a longer reach.

32
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,010
Your new power adds to your centrifugal force,

33
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,580
thus making your blade even more accurate and powerful.

34
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,440
Wh-What the...?

35
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,510
Oi, nothing's been broken.

36
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,030
Take a look at the ceiling.

37
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,820
The ceiling?

38
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,190
Huh?

39
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,450
I can see the sky...

40
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Wow...

41
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,970
I wonder why...

42
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,410
Oi, you don't mean that he actually cut through the Tower of Justice?!

43
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,580
This is dangerous!

44
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,240
How pathetic.

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,410
Letting your emotions overrun you in a fight.

46
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,880
Shut up, already.

47
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,220
I happen to like this giraffe form.

48
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,260
I love giraffes.

49
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,650
Yeah...

50
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,100
I got it, I got it.

51
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,690
No matter how much sharper your blade may have gotten,

52
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,110
that doesn't scare me even one bit.

53
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,980
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ouch! Stop it Zoro!

54
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,020
S-Stop! Stop it, Zoro!

55
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,880
That hurts! What are you doing?!

56
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,760
Why are you pulling on me?!

57
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,780
Huh? Pulling?

58
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,900
Wow, we're completely stuck.

59
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,380
Yeah, so it seems...

60
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,260
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

61
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,220
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!!

62
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,210
It's because you ran into me!

63
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,320
That's because you were just standing there during his attack!

64
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,350
Just hurry and take these cuffs off!

65
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,260
What are those morons doing?

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,770
I don't know...

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,110
In conclusion, right now we're in exactly the same situation as Robin.

68
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,470
Then, the key is...

69
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,470
One of the CP9 members have it,

70
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
and the only way to get it is to beat them.

71
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,550
That's impossible! How the hell can we fight like this?!

72
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,830
Our prey got stuck together.

73
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,590
Alright, Jyabura.

74
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,380
Just stand back and leave those two guys to me.

75
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,800
Hey! Are you trying to take my prey away from me?!

76
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,340
Then what is it?

77
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,700
You saying you wanna fight together?

78
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,970
I'd rather die than do that.

79
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,140
Same goes for me.

80
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,360
Oi, you guys!

81
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,960
Tell us the number on your handcuffs.

82
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,650
Number?

83
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,190
In order to know which key belongs to which handcuffs,

84
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,630
each pair and their keys are labeled individually with a number.

85
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,490
If we have the keys to those handcuffs,

86
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,090
then we can unlock them for you.

87
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,580
Huh? Really?!

88
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,760
Number... The number....

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,620
Oh, here it is! It's number two!

90
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,570
Unlock it please!

91
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Not it.

92
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,060
Mine, neither.

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,010
Too bad.

94
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,760
What the hell?! After getting our hopes up!

95
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,990
Damn it...

96
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,850
So that means that one of the other three CP9 members have it.

97
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,640
Oh well...

98
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,510
Then, whoever gets the kill first wins.

99
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,040
Guess that's all we can do.

100
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,300
WHAT?!

101
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,410
Whoa! What's with these stairs?

102
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,620
They're cut and out of position.

103
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,820
Something must have happened from that impact I felt earlier.

104
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,130
Is this building okay?

105
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,220
Oi, are you guys okay?!

106
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,630
Zoro!

107
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,110
Sogeking!

108
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,280
Oi! Chopper!

109
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,500
What?

110
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,620
They're waving...

111
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,580
Looks like they're having fun.

112
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,250
Oi~!!

113
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,930
DUMBASS!!

114
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,690
LOOK AT THE HANDCUFFS!!

115
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,770
GO FIND THE NUMBER TWO KEY!!

116
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,590
Huh? Key?

117
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,720
Key?

118
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,940
What the hell is this?

119
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,700
I thought there was gonna be a bridge or something.

120
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,680
That's one huge whirlpool!

121
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,660
I can see the Gates of Justice, but can I get across on a regular boat?

122
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,180
Anyway, there's no time.

123
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,660
I've gotta try something!

124
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,470
Here I go!

125
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,030
HOLD ON!!

126
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,910
ROBIN!!

127
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,210
Yeah! Yeah!

128
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,010
We found out how to get to the Gates!

129
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,470
Let's go tell everyone!

130
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,330
That was close!

131
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:06,640
What's this?

132
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,940
Gee = Sound Effect for Staring

133
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,110
Gee~!

134
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,940
Gee~!

135
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,400
Th-This is...!

136
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,530
It couldn't be...

137
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,080
Here!

138
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,600
What the...?!

139
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,930
We did it!

140
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,500
We found another secret passage way!

141
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,490
Yeah!

142
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
Where the hell are we?!

143
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,600
Help! Help me!

144
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,340
Pirate-niichan!

145
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,910
What are you doing?!

146
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,790
I see.

147
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,210
The keys and the handcuffs both have numbers.

148
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,730
What?

149
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,610
If you guys are stuck like that,

150
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,570
then I'll just fight them both.

151
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,950
Don't be stupid!

152
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,090
There are two of them!

153
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,580
If you get beaten,

154
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,610
then we'll still be cuffed and end up being killed like this.

155
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,660
Please! You're our only hope!

156
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,720
Hope?

157
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,020
That doesn't make me happy!

158
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,990
Damn it!

159
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,190
Sanji, Nami, or Franky.

160
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,400
When one of them gets a hold of key number two,

161
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,960
bring it here immediately.

162
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,660
We're counting on you!

163
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,180
The one who'll get the key the quickest...

164
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,610
...is probably Sanji.

165
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,820
I'll look for Sanji.

166
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,910
I'm their only hope!

167
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,390
I've caught you now~!

168
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,180
Let go of me!

169
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,640
Yoyoi!

170
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,320
Just give up already~!

171
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,650
Die~!

172
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,330
I don't even stand a chance against him.

173
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,210
Franky~

174
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,130
Tekkai!

175
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,340
Boxing!

176
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,430
Soru. (Shave)

177
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,350
What's up with your punch?

178
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,780
You're no ordinary human, are you?

179
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,220
No matter how much you harden your body like steel,

180
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,660
my fists are made of real steel.

181
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,850
Not now!

182
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,690
This is no time to be drinking tea!

183
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,080
A spell!

184
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,890
I was put under a spell!

185
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,090
I was almost swallowed by a high tide, called a 'trap of love'!

186
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,620
You've had three cups already.

187
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,720
Shut up, you witch!

188
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,980
I'm not falling for any more of your traps!

189
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,720
The CP9 members that insulted Robin-chan so horribly on the Sea Train...

190
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,400
I'll never forget that!

191
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,960
Now...

192
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,420
Give me your key!

193
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,420
Too bad.

194
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,050
I guess you're in a hurry.

195
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,570
Go ahead.

196
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,240
Please help yourself to the key.

197
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,260
Where is it?

198
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,240
I don't know.

199
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,650
It's on my body somewhere...

200
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,040
I wonder where it's hidden.

201
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,890
Why don't you search me?

202
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,260
e& WITH PLEASURE~!! e&

203
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,460
You've made a bad start.

204
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,850
I'm such an idiot...

205
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,980
If you're looking for Nico Robin,

206
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,850
she's getting closer and closer to the Gates of Justice as we speak.

207
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,100
But, for her, I guess we should say that she's getting closer to hell.

208
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,070
I already know that.

209
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,590
That's right, Robin-chan's life is on the line.

210
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,950
If you get in my way, I won't hold back, even if you are a woman!

211
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,950
Just hand over your key before you get hurt!

212
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,070
Shouting isn't going to get you the keys.

213
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,780
You don't have to think of me as a woman.

214
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,010
I haven't lived in such an easy world.

215
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,220
As long as there's an order to eliminate,

216
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,100
all I have to do is take your life.

217
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm not giving you my life.

218
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,390
The thing I want...

219
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,970
...is the key to Robin-chan's handcuffs.

220
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,750
Then it's okay that tea time is over?

221
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,330
Soru! (Shave)

222
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,290
Your power is definitely that of a superwoman.

223
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,640
I've got you!

224
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,070
Got one shot in.

225
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,130
You...

226
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,730
How could you do such a thing?

227
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,140
I guess that's what they call 'getting yours', don't you think?

228
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,850
You damn little brat!

229
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,130
Getsu Pou! (Moon Walk)

230
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,300
He's fast!

231
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,740
I just stomped you to the ground.

232
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,010
You've already lost!

233
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,630
Now, the key...

234
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,290
Shigan! (Finger Gun)

235
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,380
Rankyaku!

236
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,220
What a boring man.

237
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,330
Yet you call yourself a pirate...

238
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,100
How utterly spineless.

239
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,030
Oi! Shut the hell up!

240
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,620
Give me the key!

241
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,720
I'm through with your obvious threats.

242
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,990
Would you like me to do something fun?

243
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,850
If you don't attack, you will not survive.

244
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,840
He's not coming after me.

245
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,590
That's good.

246
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,570
If he caught up with me again, I'd definitely be dead.

247
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,130
I just have to escape...

248
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,850
Seimei Kikan! (Life Return)

249
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,660
Yoyoi!

250
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,430
Yoi! Yoi! Yoyoi~!

251
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,370
Damn it!

252
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,050
Now, now~!

253
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,360
Shall I just...

254
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,820
...blow you away now, or choke you to death~?

255
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,540
A cold wind blows on this nature!

256
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,960
A peaceful death that couldn't wait for the sprout of spring~!

257
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,560
At least once, allow a blossom of lovely red flowers!

258
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,330
To scatter them around is my obligation to human nature~!

259
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,610
When you go to the other side,

260
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,960
when you see my deceased mother...

261
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,890
Please, let her know...

262
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,210
that I am... I am well,

263
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,650
and killing~!

264
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,920
Now die~!

265
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,050
Now, now, now~!

266
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,180
No!

267
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,100
Haru Gin Jyou! (Spring Brew Emotion)

268
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,470
Kokutei!

269
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,230
Roseo! (Cherry Blossom)

270
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,110
Nami! Are you okay?!

271
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:07,960
Chopper...

272
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,980
Thank you, you saved me.

273
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,810
What is that?

274
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,120
Does he have a Devil Fruit?

275
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,410
I don't know...

276
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,430
His hair moves like an octopus, I couldn't do anything at all.

277
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,570
Anyway, now's our chance, Chopper.

278
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,420
Let's get the hell out of here.

279
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,480
Why?

280
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,600
If we don't beat him, the key...

281
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,700
This key?

282
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,370
I stole the key without him noticing, but I couldn't get away from him.

283
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,220
Do you know everyone's situation?

284
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,470
Hey, Nami.

285
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,980
What number is that key?

286
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,280
Number?

287
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,570
It's three.

288
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,780
That's not it.

289
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,380
What's with this number?

290
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,860
Something just fell down.

291
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,350
Is this...

292
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,560
...a doll?

293
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,960
It's not.

294
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,700
Sanji?!

295
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,230
Why does he look like that?

296
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,220
Sanji!

297
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,960
Oi, what happened?!

298
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,510
Why's your body like this?

299
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,850
Are you okay, Sanji-kun?!

300
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,660
SANJI!!

301
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,710
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,990
I lost.

303
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,020
I couldn't get the key...

304
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,340
Hold on, Sanji.

305
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,410
I'll fix you up right away!

306
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,880
I never thought that Sanji-kun would be defeated.

307
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,180
Sanji-kun.

308
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,480
Were you really unable to win?

309
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,850
Did you really fight properly?

310
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,520
Your opponent was that woman, wasn't it?

311
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,300
You're soft on women, aren't you?

312
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,790
I'm sorry about the key.

313
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,320
That's not it!

314
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,980
I'm just saying that you could die because of your stupid way of chivalry!

315
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,870
Are you still gonna honor it, even when you end up like this?

316
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,450
What are you gonna do if you die?!

317
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,470
It's not...

318
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,410
...like I wanna die.

319
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,790
However, I've been raised to never  kick a woman.

320
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,700
That's why...

321
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,880
...even if I die, I will never kick a woman!

322
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,010
You're so stupid.

323
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,070
You idiot!

324
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,500
Oi! What are you doing, Nami?!

325
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,240
If running away is also against your way of chivalry,

326
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,170
then at least throw that away!

327
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,240
To die without a cause is a different story entirely!

328
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,070
Leave that woman to me...

329
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,460
And also,

330
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,110
I've changed my opinion about your way of chivalry.

331
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,440
Did you just say you love me more?

332
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,140
She didn't say that!

333
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,990
I'm not as nice as that guy.

334
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,100
Me neither.

335
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,710
Looks like we'll get along well.

336
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,190
Oi! Don't you wanna help Nico Robin?!

337
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,490
Hurry up and get me a cola!

338
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,980
I haven't forgiven you yet!

339
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,380
Forget about that and hurry up!

340
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,670
With a cola, I'll be able to power up!

341
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,860
Who's stupid enough to become stronger with a cola?!

342
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,940
Leave me alone! I do!

343
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,370
Just watch, I'll finish him off in an instant!

344
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,540
Next time, One Piece: The Silent Owl's Miscalculation!
My Cola is the Water of Life

345
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,580
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

346
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080

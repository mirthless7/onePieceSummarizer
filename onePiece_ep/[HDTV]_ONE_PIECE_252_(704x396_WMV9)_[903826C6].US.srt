1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,413
You left the crew of the Straw hat,
but you did not give up for as much piracy.

2
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,345
Since you are a pirate, one will have to take you along with us.

3
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:19,880
MERRY!!!

4
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:25,480
I will say to you what I know.

5
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:32,480
You do not know the sorrows that I endured
in my life because of the world government!

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,546
Then why you help this government,
if you hate it as much as that?!

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,146
Because I wish to protect something at all costs.

8
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:55,480
They gave again me taste with the life,
saved my heart and the dreams which I had lost.

9
00:00:56,546 --> 00:01:00,680
I was made friends who believe in me.

10
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:06,946
But then n the other hand…

11
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:14,413
I could authorize the 6 members of the crew of
Luffy me excluded to leave this island alive!

12
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:21,413
And for that, you are ready to awake the old ones
weapons with the risk to destroy the world?!

13
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,546
Completely.

14
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:33,945
In spite of all the human lives of this world…

15
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,613
it is you six whom it chose.

16
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,880
All that for us…

17
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,212
Chopper! Upright!

18
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:43,745
One will seek the others!

19
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:45,080
Chopper! Hey! Upright! Chopper!

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,146
Oï, oï, it is seriously wounded!
Chopper! Hey! Upright! Chopper!

21
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:14,146
Well, the CP9 soon will arrive.

22
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:15,813
Nico Robin…

23
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:18,079
go up in first in Umi Ressha.

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,012
There do not remain not planted!
The guy, dispatch you to take it along!

25
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,146
Yes!

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,146
Hauts fonctionnaires of the government,
Navy and Robin-chan.

27
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:38,480
Now, how will I have to act?

28
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,213
I carry a darkness in me that none you knows.

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,680
It would be said that it is made remove…

30
00:02:49,013 --> 00:02:53,746
But with this kind of the types, if she wanted it
she could easily escape to them.

31
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,745
She has something at the head…

32
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,280
or there is a reason which prevents it from fleeing.

33
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:07,213
Afflicted to have made you wait, Robin-chan!

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,480
I awaited you, my Prince!

35
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:21,213
Or after all, it does all that
in the hope which I come to save it!

36
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:41,213
kougi-san!

37
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:43,079
Here is the CP9.

38
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,280
How?

39
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,612
Whoa, it is Rob Lucci-san!

40
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,413
Which power.

41
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,880
It is thus that the CP9.

42
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:03,013
You do not want to include/understand?! Release me, whore!

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,345
Where you take me along?!

44
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,145
I will never forgive it to you!

45
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:14,013
You do not lose anything to wait!
Hey! I have an army of 8000 Ho…

46
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,413
Usopp?

47
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:25,779
THE WHISTLE SEPARATES THE GROUP!
UMI RESSHA LEAVES

48
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,679
Where you take me along, band of dumbs?!

49
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,145
I will never forgive it to you!

50
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:33,745
You do not lose anything to wait!

51
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,880
I have an army of 8000 Ho…

52
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,080
Usopp?

53
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,546
Thank you very much for your efforts during the mission!

54
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,079
Lucci-san, your coat.

55
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,213
They exaggerate

56
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,279
Put an end to all that.

57
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,480
O-Oui, immediately.

58
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,212
It is not a play!

59
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,946
Be vigilant!

60
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:06,146
Get all into the train!

61
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,345
Everyone on train!

62
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,880
You for the departure prepare towards Enies Lobby!

63
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,546
I said to you to release me…

64
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,680
But which is with the Juste?

65
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:24,346
However…

66
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,346
he had said “Afflicted, I caused you only troubles”…

67
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:30,546
Even left the crew, it continues with us emmerder.

68
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:32,612
A little on the right!

69
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:33,945
Sprinkle this part well!

70
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:36,013
One needs more water!

71
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:38,012
Still a little.

72
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:39,479
It is regulated on this side!

73
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,345
You occupy casualties!

74
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,679
Yosh, included/understood!

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,345
There is still somebody inside?

76
00:07:44,346 --> 00:07:46,212
Pay attention where you steps!

77
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:50,412
Then Robin does not hate us?!

78
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,679
Ouais!

79
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,613
It is brilliant!

80
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:55,212
It was transformed into raccoon!

81
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,945
An raccoon…

82
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:59,079
Oï, it became an raccoon…

83
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,812
Chopper, it is necessary that one finds Luffy
and the others and which one seeks Robin!

84
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:05,880
It is included/understood, one will seek them.

85
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,813
Where are they?

86
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,812
It is for that one must go to their research.

87
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:11,280
Yosh!

88
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,813
I will do my better!

89
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,680
It became a gorilla!

90
00:08:17,546 --> 00:08:19,013
Wait…

91
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:24,545
I card-index myself that you seek Nico Robin…

92
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:29,280
but this night with 23:00, Umi Ressha
will leave with people the government.

93
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:32,613
Nmaa~ and thus…

94
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,413
there are strong chances that they are on board.

95
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:38,479
What wants to say that Nico Robin will be there too.

96
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:43,746
It will be the last departure of
Umi Ressha before one good moment…

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,746
because of the imminent arrival of Aqua Laguna.

98
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,013
That would like to say…

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,812
If you loupez this train, you will be retained here…
since you cannot take boat of course.

100
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:59,612
Not that! It is terrible! What a hour is it?!

101
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:00,412
22:30.

102
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,545
What?! There remains to us nothing any more but half an hour!

103
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,412
Can't Hey, you do something?

104
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:07,546
Please, delay the departure of Umi Ressha!

105
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,879
Nmaa~ the destination is Enies Lobby…

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,613
It is a place which only members
government can reach.

107
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,945
Even technicians of the train
belong to the government.

108
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,545
They will not listen to me.

109
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:18,946
Not that!

110
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:23,945
It is necessary that I go to the station in a manner
or of another, and to convince Robin to remain.

111
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,146
Chopper!

112
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:30,080
I will indicate to you towards which direction Luffy and Zoro
fell, so that you can find them.

113
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,680
If you find them, say to them
to return immediately to the station!

114
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,146
Well, I included/understood!

115
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,413
Oï, the guy!

116
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,613
Paulee-san, nothing of broken?!

117
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,813
Give a knack to these deux-là!

118
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,479
Their to give a knack?!

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,879
But Paulee-san, it is not them
who tried to kill Iceberg-san?!

120
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,345
They would have rather to be stopped at once!

121
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,679
Lucci-san and Kaku-san are always carried disp…

122
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,479
The assassins are not the members
of the crew of the Straw hat!

123
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,280
They are innocent!

124
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:07,080
They were made have by truths assassins
and showed we them wrongly!

125
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,013
I do not know which they is, but the crew of
Straw hat fought against these masked types!

126
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,346
If me and Iceberg-san naps still in life…

127
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,546
it is thanks to them.

128
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,413
It is not the sorrow to seek Lucci and Kaku.

129
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,545
They any more will not be re-examined.

130
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,345
What?

131
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:33,680
You know what became Lucci-san and the others?!

132
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,479
They returned on their premises.

133
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,945
You pleasant?! Why they would go
on their premises in a similar moment?!

134
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:40,280
Close it and seeks the team-members of the Straw hat!

135
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,212
Hey, the streetwalker!

136
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:45,012
Do not call me like that!

137
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,345
You want to go to the station, not? I will take you along there.

138
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,680
Euh… Thank you.

139
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,812
Paulee-san, hey…

140
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,880
You are serious?

141
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,412
STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOU AND
SHOWN GOOD SENSE!

142
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,546
YOU WISH TO DISHONOR THE GALLEY IT?!

143
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,412
Yes, owner!

144
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:01,412
Forgiveness!

145
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:02,945
We are sorry!

146
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,812
One will give you a knack,
say to us what it is necessary to do!

147
00:11:04,813 --> 00:11:06,012
Leave will yagaras them!

148
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,480
Open the cages!

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,146
“Returned on their premises”, hein?

150
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,813
It is preferable not to say too much of it.

151
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:23,147
It is already sufficient which this frustration
that is to say felt by us two.

152
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:45,480
Chopper, I count on you!

153
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:50,680
Ouais! I hope well to return with them.

154
00:11:55,813 --> 00:12:02,813
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

155
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:09,880
MUGIWARA-TEAM

156
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,613
Oï!!

157
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:16,213
The guy!!

158
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:19,813
Oï!!

159
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:23,813
Oï! Luffy!

160
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:25,412
Zoro!

161
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,413
Sanji!

162
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,013
Usopp, please, return…

163
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:32,479
Everyone with me!

164
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Well, it is included/understood! The guy, you heard?!

165
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:39,346
Oï, Luffy!

166
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,012
Zoro!

167
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,546
Sanji!

168
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,747
Usopp, please return…

169
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,946
Turn by here!

170
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:56,147
It is a short cut for the station!

171
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,450
There remain to us nothing any more but 20 minutes before the departure.

172
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,913
Does not leave, Robin.

173
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:15,347
It Will not be forgiven if you endure that without us!

174
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,479
Yagara-shan, please!

175
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,413
More quickly!

176
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,080
The last train of 23:00.

177
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:39,680
At the beginning of the station Blue Station of
Seven toilets in direction of Enies Lobby.

178
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,279
Remain quiet.

179
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,412
Bandage dumbs!
Treat us with more precaution! BA-KA!

180
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,812
Ouais, ouais! BA-KA!

181
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,879
Small shits of the government!

182
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,613
Euh… not, it is a little…

183
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,479
Because of an abrupt rise of water,
the schedules changed. The departure is imminent.

184
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,747
Shit, it leaves already.

185
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:14,080
Our mission touches at its end.

186
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:18,146
Would not be also optimistic, us
sums not arrived yet.

187
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,413
Idiot.

188
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,480
Afflicted.

189
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,012
If you miss this train, you will not have any more
no chance to leave this island in time.

190
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:32,347
Please, it is necessary that one arrives in time!

191
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,550
Franky…

192
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,150
Dumb… How are you?

193
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,479
Straw hat!

194
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,479
Roronoa!

195
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,146
Luffy!

196
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,079
Where are you?

197
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,079
Hey, where are you?

198
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,479
Make signs to us!

199
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,079
Zoro!

200
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,280
Sanji!

201
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,280
Usopp, please return…

202
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:18,812
Luffy!

203
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:21,880
Robin will be made remove!

204
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,546
Please, answer!

205
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,480
Where be you?!

206
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,680
What makes Luffy and the others?

207
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,813
None of them will be there in time.

208
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:44,212
I repeat…

209
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:47,880
The last train is leaving soon.

210
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:55,512
Chuuuchain!
“Whore!”

211
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,580
Cheee them…
“I them…”

212
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,947
will chaaardonnerai chaaamais!
“will never forgive!”

213
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
Ch' uis coinché.

214
00:16:08,613 --> 00:16:11,413
Pitches, I lost balance.

215
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:16,813
Shit!

216
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,880
I am wedged…

217
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:26,412
Luffy!

218
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:27,946
Zoro!

219
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:30,213
Sanji!

220
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:32,213
You show!

221
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:35,480
One must save Robin!

222
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,547
Roronoa!

223
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,547
Where can they be well?!

224
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,280
That gives what by here?!

225
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:51,812
Straw hat!

226
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,012
Zoro!

227
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,813
They are surely not here…

228
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,213
Perhaps what are they in the low city?

229
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,146
If it is the case, they had to be
carried by the shrinking of water.

230
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,346
Moreover, they is well too dangerous to go over there.

231
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:04,947
Fact of shitting!

232
00:17:04,947 --> 00:17:06,279
Straw hat!

233
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,947
Roronoa!

234
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,546
Lucci-san!

235
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:26,212
The waves are increasingly large,
we thus will have to leave a little earlier than envisaged.

236
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,012
That poses it pro…

237
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,880
Not, let us leave.

238
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,413
Yes, very well.

239
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:35,280
We lived here during 5 years…

240
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,147
but I however do not regret any to leave this place.

241
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:02,412
He, you did not hear like
a whistle of train?!

242
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,679
Ouais, but it is odd…

243
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,547
It is not yet the hour of the departure!

244
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,550
But they do not transport
passengers, this time.

245
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:18,947
It is possible that they have advanced
the departure because of the weather.

246
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,679
We dispatch! The station is just opposite!

247
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,280
Stop, Umi Ressha!

248
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,080
The last voyage day of Umi Ressha,
in departure of Seven Toilets towards Enies Lobby.

249
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
We leave. You sit.

250
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:42,147
It is the departure.

251
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:52,612
I do not have any more any reason to live.

252
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:54,079
Leave me.

253
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,947
And then initially, why should I obey you?

254
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,413
You forced me to live, me which wished only to die.

255
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:04,347
It is of your fault.

256
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:12,947
I do not have nowhere where to go nor where to return.

257
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,212
Then lets remain to me on your boat.

258
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:19,012
Mellorin~! Mello~! Mellorin~!
Oh, I see. Then I do not have the choice. They is good, remains.

259
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,813
LUFFY!!

260
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,213
Of made you not.

261
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,813
It is not a bad person.

262
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,947
It is impossible, Rio Ponéglyphe is…

263
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,147
Therefore, Ponéglyphes which I study since all
this time is guiding me…

264
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:45,847
with more far from Large Line, Rough tel.

265
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:11,880
Robin!

266
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,146
Robin!

267
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:15,080
How do you feel you?

268
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:28,879
He starts to move…

269
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,747
Whores of dumbs of the government…

270
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,080
We are there! Thank you very much, Yagara-chan!

271
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:44,412
Take the staircases of the central entry!

272
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:45,680
Yes!

273
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:46,679
Robin!

274
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,147
Do not leave!

275
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,946
Hey, which are you?!

276
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:02,013
Move back, they are dangerous!

277
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:08,679
Robin, get out of the train!

278
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,812
We will fight against no matter whom!

279
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,012
Luffy!

280
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,612
Zoro!

281
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:18,813
Where are you?

282
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:25,547
I am not able to leave me…

283
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,947
Wait!

284
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,480
Stop this train!

285
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:37,480
Wait!

286
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:46,450
ROBIN!!!

1
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,490
It is not an exit!

2
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,720
It IS an ENTRY!

3
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,730
It IS the CELESTIAL ISLAND!!!

4
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,830
Heso.

5
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,110
Yes, excuse me!

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,980
I stop immediately!

7
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,280
Is nobody wounded?

8
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,190
AND YOU THEN?!

9
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,620
It is not easy to take in hand!

10
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,750
Nami-san! You are the best!!

11
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,170
Oh my god! Here are which is surprising!

12
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,160
I have evil to believe my eyes of them!

13
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,560
How can it control this trick?!

14
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,050
He!

15
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,730
Where did Nami-san pass?

16
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,690
Father, goes it
to leave itself there?

17
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,520
Yes, Conis-san… I
am not quiet either.

18
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,260
What?

19
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,160
What? Does Y' have a problem?

20
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,150
It is in Skypiea a prohibited necessary where,
no matter what it arrives, no one should not penetrate.

21
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,620
One should never put the feet at it…

22
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,380
And why that?

23
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
It is a crowned ground.

24
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,040
A crowned ground?

25
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,830
This ground is called…

26
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,780
[Note:Upper Yard =
The higher garden]

27
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,780
The Field of God, “Upper Yard”.

28
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:37,740
The prohibited ground sacree! The Field
of God and the Celestial Judgment!

29
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,520
God saw over there?!

30
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,630
Where one never must
to put the feet?!

31
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,080
Yes.

32
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,340
Euh, by “God”, you
please say God?

33
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,470
Does God live on the celestial island?

34
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:01,280
Yes. Skypiea is its Field, it is
directed by Very Powerful God, Eneru.

35
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,460
Very Powerful God?

36
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,880
Eneru God knows absolutely all
from what occurs in this world.

37
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,030
Absolutely all?!

38
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,990
It observes us, all the time.

39
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,300
Q-what?! All the time?!

40
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,470
Even now?

41
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,670
Of course.

42
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,550
Hein?! It observes us
in this exact moment?!

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,800
Pfff… God?

44
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,750
Don't Zoro, you believe in a God?

45
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,180
I know anything of it. That it
exist or not, I don't care.

46
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,740
I am never interested there.

47
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,470
But good, I do not have anything
against those which believe in it.

48
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,300
Therefore, this God who
live in Upper Yard…

49
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,480
You have already
considering, Conis-chan?

50
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,410
Not! I never saw it!

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,580
We cannot go in Upper Yard.

52
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,620
Never…

53
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,400
Crowned ground, Upper
Yard, is prohibited.

54
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,700
There is thus a ground
firm on the celestial island…

55
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,250
It is true all that?

56
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,650
A place where it is necessary especially
not to put the feet, hein?

57
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,330
He, Luffy!

58
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,050
With what are to you in the train
to think there, brothel?!

59
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,950
Listen to what it is
saying to us!

60
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,580
“One cannot go there” means only you
do not have ABSOLUTELY to go over there, Luffy!

61
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,180
It is true?

62
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,150
A place where it is necessary especially
not to put the feet, hein?

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,270
It is well that? A place where it is necessary
especially not to put the feet, hein?

64
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,750
There it will want to go, it is sure…

65
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,950
But even if one should not go there,
Will God forgive us not if it is done?

66
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,040
He is sympathetic, not?

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,620
Not… enfreindre a rule
of God is a sacrilege.

68
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,220
Good Ah? Ben so much worse then.

69
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,980
He will go there even if
God does not forgive him!

70
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,510
But which are the consequences if
one enters this Upper prohibited Yard?

71
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,730
E-and well…

72
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,740
And well?

73
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,950
We think that one
does not return alive from there.

74
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,760
O it does not return alive from there?!

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,340
V have you fear for
Isn't Nami-san?

76
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,340
Let us request so that it
too much does not approach Upper Yard!

77
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,310
NAMI-SWAAAN!

78
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,210
One goes there! One will seek Nami!

79
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,580
DO NOT MOVE! ONE COMES TO SEEK YOU!

80
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,010
You really count
to go to seek Nami?!

81
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,260
NAMI-SWAAAN!!

82
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,260
All that you want is to go
at the place prohibited, not true?!

83
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,030
NAMI-SWAAAN!!!

84
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,760
What?

85
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,700
These trees are immense…

86
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,110
I never saw anything of tel.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,100
From how much centuries are it old?

88
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,420
They all are so much…

89
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,680
One does not even see the summit of it!

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,310
I am sure.

91
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,650
A treasure is certainly…

92
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,020
… some share by there!

93
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,700
It is within reach!

94
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,200
There is somebody here.

95
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,380
One is there almost! Grouille!

96
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,090
Ca came from there.

97
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,260
He, Luffy! Allons-y!

98
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,160
One second. I eat initially.

99
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,790
And if something arrived at Nami-san
while are to you eating?!

100
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,220
Forget puffs out it! One
returns quickly in any case.

101
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,580
Go what. One second…

102
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,850
Conis-chan, one can await it
like that all the day.

103
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,090
Said to us just how
us to return in Upper Yard!

104
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,170
But…

105
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,870
One is not sure that it
that is to say really gone over there…

106
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,190
And then…

107
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,240
One should not especially attract oneself
the anger of Eneru God.

108
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,690
Eneru God with the alarming air…

109
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,480
Eneru God…

110
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,510
God, hein?

111
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,340
It would be said… that it
nobody on board has there.

112
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,050
Traces of claws…

113
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,760
They were attacked
by something?

114
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,030
I am sure!

115
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,940
A treasure is certainly…
some share by there!

116
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,920
An extraordinary treasure is here!

117
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,380
It is within reach!

118
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,280
I feel it!

119
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,280
L it shell spoke!

120
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,070
We are there almost!

121
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,800
Grouille!

122
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,310
It is a shell, not? It cannot
not there to have somebody inside…

123
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,570
Listen, if one keeps this newspaper,
one day it will have value!

124
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,080
This shell… can
to record the voices.

125
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,770
Not! I want to set out again!

126
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,690
J-J' am afraid. I feel it…

127
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
The anger of God!

128
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,450
It is what this noise?

129
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,990
It is…

130
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,360
God!

131
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,820
They were killed…

132
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,110
By God…

133
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,520
I should return. They is dangerous.

134
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,770
It is to better move away
as much as possible from here.

135
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,350
The Help!!

136
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,900
The Help!!

137
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,930
Go! Hoist the veils!

138
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,120
Cape on the place where it is necessary
especially not to put the feet!

139
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,740
Ah, excuse me! For the moment,
the wind comes from opposite!

140
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,150
With this wind, you will spend a time
considerable to reach Upper Yard!

141
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,340
All my excuses!

142
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,660
What?!

143
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,220
Considerable?!

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,010
Ca would go more quickly if your boat
used the energy of Dials.

145
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,450
I am sorry.

146
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,720
“Considerable” wants
to say how long?

147
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,720
I do not know… Until
what the wind turns…

148
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,720
It is thus that? Considerable, hein?

149
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,100
Nami is surely in danger without
large Usopp-sama to help it…

150
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,170
Doesn't Papi, y' have a faster means?

151
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,170
If one grouille not,
Nami will be of return!

152
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,710
But if y' does not have wind, one cannot…

153
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,710
He, Luffy! You thought
thus with that since the beginning!

154
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,750
About what you do speak?

155
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,600
Salt lying…

156
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,550
Dumb…

157
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,720
He is with me!

158
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,220
It is what that?

159
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,620
I hear noise.

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,930
What is this…?

161
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,420
Give up!

162
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,070
Speak for you! It
with me that one is!

163
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,570
Out of my way!

164
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,900
You even!

165
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,990
Q - What
happens…?

166
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
This forest is well agitated.

167
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,410
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

168
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,870
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

169
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,530
A place was finally found dangerous where to go! I will not wait until the wind changes direction!

170
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,600
He, Luffy! Do not say to me that it is…

171
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,300
… the Waver old man very broken!

172
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,420
It left!

173
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,270
What a cretin!

174
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,530
You see! You do not want to listen to me?!

175
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,020
Ahh… I run…

176
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,490
What does one make? He runs again.

177
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,380
Let us leave it!

178
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,480
Brothel, be to you really
heavy with your conneries.

179
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,890
It is thus that your Waver old man?

180
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,820
It, isn't this is really worn?

181
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,110
One found it in the sea of in lower part.

182
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,360
If that does not disturb you
not, do I can examine it?

183
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,540
I can surely repair it.

184
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,900
You can repair it, papi?

185
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,420

186
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,040

00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,720
Did Ah ouais? You want
what one fights for him?

191
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,910
I do not see there an objection.

192
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,010
It is perfect to kill time!

193
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,890
What unimportant remarks!

194
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,310
You will be used as meal with my dog!

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,530
What a spectacle!

196
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,950
A duel of weak weaklings!

197
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,750
It is you the weakling!

198
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,550
Q-what?!

199
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,260
What?!

200
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,850
He! I helps!

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,050
Take me along with you!

202
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,890
To take you along with me?

203
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,810
But there is only one place!

204
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,790

celestial to seek a treasure!

205
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,330

I beg you!

207
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,980
I do not know if it will go…

208
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,990
I do not know!

209
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I will go up even if I must kill you!

210
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,110
A guerilla!

211
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,490
D-God…

212
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,220

213
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,420

They are the White Berets.

224
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,660
It occurred something?

225
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,920
General advertisement, be on your guards!

226
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,680
Today, several people have
penetrated illegally in Angel Beach!

227
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,430
It would seem that they are seven!

228
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,590
The White Berets are in alarm
maximum and seek these criminals!

229
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,930
If you are vigilant

Be vigilant!

231
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,660
You did not have the impression
what it spoke with somebody?

232
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,850
A guerilla. He is
party, moreover.

233
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,010
He, Ho!

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,630
Make conceal this foutu dog!

235
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,170
It had to beseech its pity.

236
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,980
But… why Eneru-sama
does it intervene itself?

237
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,400
What good is it to have sent to us?

238
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,680
Ca wants to say that time was past.

239
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,570
Was time past?

240
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,140
The new clandestine ones
have just arrived.

241
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,980
Still?

242
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,040
A crew of seven individuals coming from
Blue sea at summer announced by the Amazon old woman.

243
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,270
Seven individuals coming from the Blue Sea…

244
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,300
He speaks about us?!

245
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,700
“Of clandestine”?

246
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,330
You discharge tax of immigration of 1
Billion Extols each one and go your way!

247
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,040
It is the payment.

248
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,040
It is because one does not have
paid the tax of immigration?

249
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:04,850
Oh not!

250
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,400
Types of this boat…

251
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,190
And the man of presently…

252
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,650
The clandestine ones…

253
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,570
But then, we will undergo
same fate us too?

254
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,740
Pas la pains to disturb us
for seven people only.

255
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,290
Moreover, seven it is not
divisible by four.

256
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,250
What occurs, brothel?

257
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,240
Who are they?

258
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,760
It is what this place?!

259
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,500
I must quickly return
and to prevent the others!

260
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,260
This place is dangerous!

261
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,870
How you find, Usopp? Look at!

262
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,970
Mine also is ready!

263
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,280
Look at to me that! My speciality
they is the spit portraits!

264
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,990
Incredible!

265
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,610
The spit portrait of which exactly?!

266
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,420
This trick…

267
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,650
… I will explode it!

268
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,590
Brothel! It is the portrait
spit of anybody, Long Conk!

269
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,590
Not! Stop! What a horrible thing!

270
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,310
You can repair it?

271
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,190
I never saw this model before.

272
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,810
Try to repair it, please!

273
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,670
Afflicted, if I do not examine it
sufficient, I will not be able.

274
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,420
In any case, I count on you.

275
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,890
I will try to dismount it.

276
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,790
Papi… It is which these?

277
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,950
Suspect boat! Do not move any more!

278
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,310
It is which these?

279
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,430
Why they crawl
like that towards us?

280
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,330
No idea!

281
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,820
It is… surely of the perverts.

282
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,090
Hein?! It is thus that a pervert…

283
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,290
Company, halt!

284
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,260
Heso!

285
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,890
Heso!

286
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,140
Hello. Heso.

287
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,050
Brothel, but of what
you speak, the guy?!

288
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,530
Who are they?

289
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,940
Of the perverts.

290
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:47,000
You are the seven clandestine ones
originating in the Blue Sea, isn't this?

291
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,470
We are here for you
to inflict the Celestial Judgment!

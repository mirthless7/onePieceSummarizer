1
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:25,990
The Reindeer with the blue nose!

2
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:25,990
The secrecy of Chopper

3
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,000
Who is this. ?

4
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,630
Ca would not be…

5
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,920
… in the other direction?

6
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,030
It is a little late, now.

7
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,800
I can still see you.

8
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Who are you?

9
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,850
THE FARM, SALTS HUMAN!

10
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,800
Is Ca better, your fever?

11
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,580
IT HAS SPEAKS!

12
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,610
Make less noise, Chopper!

13
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,970
It would seem that your fever fell, young girl.

14
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,420
Content?

15
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,690
And you are?

16
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,190
38.2°C.
It is acceptable.

17
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,310
I am doctor.

18
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,750
Dr. Kureha.

19
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,030
But me Doctorine calls.

20
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,060
A doctor?

21
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,120
But then, that must be…

22
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,990
The secrecy of my youth?

23
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,170
Not… I did not ask anything.

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,660
It is nothing more than one castle at the top of a mountain.

25
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,860
Then there was to be two other people with me, not?

26
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,820
Ouais, they sleep like babies in the part of at side.

27
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,330
They are strapping men, these deux-là.

28
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,280
Look at.

29
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,180
It is what returned to you sick.

30
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,100
What… is it?

31
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,270
You were bitten by an insect, Kestia.

32
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,770
It is a variety of poisonous tick which lives in the tropical forests.

33
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,980
The infection starts when the insect bites you and the bacterium enters through its mouth.

34
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,660
Once inside, the incubation, which lasts five days, causes an immense pain with the victim.

35
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,130
The symptoms are a fever of 40°C, infections, an ignition of the myocardium and arteries, and lead to a coma.

36
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,430
According to the state of your wound, you had to be contaminated three days ago.

37
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,370
I suppose that you must have your amount of pain until now…

38
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,060
… but if you had not touched there during two more days, that would have hurt you more.

39
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,780
Two days more?

40
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Two days more and you would have died.

41
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,200
Ca is called the five days Disease.

42
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,860
Although I had believed to understand that Kestia had died out hundreds of years ago.

43
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,730
You have chance that I still have antibiotic.

44
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,210
But where you caught that?

45
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,570
You did not walk the belly to the air on a prehistoric island, nevertheless?

46
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,170
Of course that not.

47
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,450
You know something on this subject?

48
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,220
Which surprising young girl.

49
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,450
Recouche.

50
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,450
Sleep. You are not yet completely restored.

51
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,050
Thank you very much, but I for of do not require if the fever dropped.

52
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,220
I will go back from there all alone, not?

53
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,020
Which naive young girl.

54
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,620
Normally, for the beginning of the treatment, it is necessary to count at least 10 days before curing this disease.

55
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,190
But if you hold to fall down in these sufferings and to die, it is another history.

56
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,850
Even with my drugs, you will have to remain quiet during at least three days more.

57
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,860
I cannot remain three days here!

58
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,990
We must hurry and bring back Vivi to Arabasta!

59
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,130
Two only cases where my patients leave this place…

60
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,730
… it is when they are cured or that they died. There is no other loophole.

61
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,040
It climbed the mountain with naked hands?

62
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,850
But Drum Rock is with 5000 meters of altitude!

63
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,070
This one is covered with engelures.

64
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,320
With what did think he, equipped like that?

65
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,530
Make heat water and plunges it inside immediately.

66
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,500
This one has a serious hemorrhage, six broken coasts, and the fissured vertebral column.

67
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,430
Do I can operate it?

68
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,470
This girl seems to be most badly in point.

69
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,710
She is at the borders of death.

70
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,180
Chopper, prepares phénicol, cardiotonics, and also of the tialcilline.

71
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,820
It has an infection?

72
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,180
Yes, it seems that in fact bacteria do not exist on this island.

73
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,960
Do not worry you, I will take care of this kid in blood and of this girl, I promise it to you.

74
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,890
They are my companions.

75
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,420
I know. One will help them.

76
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,010
Chopper, one begins the treatment!

77
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,120
They are my companions.

78
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,330
To eat…

79
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,860
Meat?

80
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,040
Ragout of reindeer. If you it leashes Mariner in a pot during three hours, it become delicious and tender.

81
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,770
Meat…

82
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,910
Reindeer…

83
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,290
WITH THE ASSISTANCE!

84
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,830
COME, BEEFSTEAK!

85
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,740
Wait, Luffy!

86
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,240
I must initially cook it.

87
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,650
Nami!

88
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Nami-San!

89
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,720
You are better!

90
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,860
Thanks to you, the guy.

91
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,120
Well, Nami-San! I go you concocter a small feast containing flesh of reindeer to accelerate your cure!

92
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,160
WAIT!!!

93
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,870
I am surprised. They can already run like that.

94
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,460
Who is this reindeer with the blue nose which speaks?

95
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,110
You would like the knowledge?

96
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,540
RETURN HERE, BEEFSTEAK!

97
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,750
Wait, Luffy.

98
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,540
Does not eat it yet!

99
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,990
Stop, human!

100
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,310
It is called Chopper.

101
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,800
And it is only one simple reindeer with the blue nose.

102
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,080
But the reindeers do not speak.

103
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,350
Stop!

104
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,400
There is only one difference between him and the other reindeers.

105
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,400
A difference?

106
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,160
I AM NOT EDIBLE!

107
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,920
Hito = Human

108
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,920
He ate the fruit Hito Hito.

109
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,550
The fruit Hito Hito…

110
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,580
One of the fruits of the demon…

111
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,020
Yes.

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,960
It is a reindeer which inherited of human capacities.

113
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,390
Human person who is damned!

114
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,790
Human person who is damned!

115
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,080
And I taught all to him that I knew in the medical field.

116
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,640
Wapol-Sama, Straw hat is at the top.

117
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,830
Just at the moment when I have a small hollow.

118
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,860
I will eat this kid to taste it.

119
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,720
Allons-y.

120
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,800
Dalton-San!

121
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,550
Dalton-San!

122
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,290
Dalton-San!

123
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,590
Dalton-San!

124
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,590
Dalton-San!

125
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,550
Dalton-San!

126
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,730
Do not die, please!

127
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,740
One will find it in time!

128
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,010
Please, be alive, Dalton-San!

129
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,350
Who it is?

130
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,720
HELPS US INSTEAD OF REMAINING PLANT!

131
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,960
Hello…

132
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:12,190
YOU DID NOT HEAR Me!?
DO NOT REMAIN PLANT IT AND HELPS US!

133
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,100
What occurs?

134
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,880
It is there!

135
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,640
One found Dalton-San!

136
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,620
What? They found it!

137
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:23,990
Thank you my God!

138
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,360
Dalton-San!

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,460
Dalton-San!

140
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,030
But which it is this Dalton?

141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,070
It is not…

142
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,510
Its heart stopped!

143
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,330
Join my crew, please!

144
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,480
Please, Grandmother!

145
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,840
We need a doctor on our boat!

146
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,890
Luffy!

147
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,400
It is your name, not true?

148
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,060
Ouais.

149
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Have you just called me “Grandmother”?

150
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,180
Ouais, Grandmother.

151
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,990
YOU SHOULD SUPERVISE YOUR WORDS!

152
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,400
I is still in the flower of the age, so young, it is young, 130 years, you know.

153
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,010
Wow, it pète the form, the old woman.

154
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,970
You want that I become a pirate, hein?

155
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,290
Do not tell silly things.

156
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,580
You waste your saliva.

157
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,860
I am not interested by the ocean.

158
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,480
It is not serious!

159
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,270
Let us leave to the adventure, granny!

160
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,270
He He. I have just said to you to supervise your language, not?

161
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,530
It is a pirate.

162
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,570
WAIT, BEEFSTEAK!

163
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,420
Return here, the kids!

164
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,140
RETURN!

165
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,440
Wait still a little, Nami-San!

166
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,890
I will make you a good dish with the reindeer so that you are better.

167
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,470
Before you do not succeed in doing that…

168
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,440
I WILL HAVE PUFF OUT YOU!

169
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,050
THE WITCH!

170
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,270
By does all the devils, where it leave!?

171
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,790
IT HAS KNIVES!

172
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,710
I make fun of the kitchen, leave me just quiet.

173
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,380
Snow?

174
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,490
I believed that one was inside a castle.

175
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,320
The weather is cold.

176
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,150
I would make better close it.

177
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,530
Not, remains with the bed!

178
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,950
You still have fever.

179
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,590
Not, I do not have any more.

180
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,370
It is as if it had left.

181
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,530
I sowed them…

182
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,080
But you still cannot!

183
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,830
The drugs of Doctorine have a fast effect, therefore your fever will have fallen soon.

184
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,010
But the bacteria of Kestia are still in your body.

185
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,120
You must take your drugs and remain lying, included/understood?

186
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,010
Thank you.

187
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,590
It is you who ace taken care of me, not?

188
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,050
THE FARM!

189
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,800
I AI NOT NEED FOR the RECOGNITION Of HUMAN!

190
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,350
DO NOT TEST to Me EMBOBINER!

191
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,310
Moron.

192
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,560
I do not have anything of it to make.

193
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,730
Ca will not go…

194
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,270
I say it to you…

195
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,340
You are the kind which cannot hide its feelings…

196
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,850
There is a trick which bell in this castle.

197
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,300
It made so cold there, and all this snow everywhere.

198
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,390
Cold fact!

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,860
You A LITTLE SLOW ES WITH the RELAXATION!

200
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,380
Look at.

201
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,280
All the castle is filled with snow.

202
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,280
All the doors of the unutilised parts are cold on their hinges.

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,700
Return here!

204
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,720
Eh, eh, Luffy!

205
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,700
Stop asking this witch to join us.

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,200
It is not a doctor.

207
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,830
SHE TRIES TO KILL US!

208
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,440
You are pirates?

209
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,360
Yes.

210
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,830
Truths of truths?

211
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,990
Exactly.

212
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,990
You have a flag with a tête de mort?

213
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,320
Yes on our boat.

214
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,060
Interested by the pirates?

215
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,400
NOT! AT ALL!

216
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,470
NEVER!

217
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
IDIOT!

218
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,690
Of agreement, agreement. I am sorry.

219
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,180
However…

220
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,240
If it were the case…

221
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,580
You would not like to join to you to us?

222
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,150
To traverse the oceans!

223
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,220
You want to come with us?

224
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,900
That would help me much.

225
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,730
If we had a doctor on board, I would not need to remain three days more here.

226
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,970
Moreover, on our boat we do not have…

227
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,440
WOULD NOT BE STUPID!

228
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,090
I AM A REINDEER, YOU KNOW?

229
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,690
I AI NOTHING TO MAKE WITH the HUMAN ones!!

230
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,850
I want to say, you are not afraid of me?

231
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,700
I am a reindeer, but I hold upright…

232
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,760
… and I can speak.

233
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,220
What, do you want to frighten me?

234
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,780
And I have blue truffle too.

235
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,600
Then it is there that you hid…

236
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,840
REINDEER!

237
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,550
RETURN HERE!

238
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,840
What they are fast, these deux-là.

239
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,960
I am very disappointed, young girl.

240
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,860
Who gave you the authorization to make charm with Chopper when I am not there?

241
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,250
Oh. You want to say that I need your permission?

242
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,450
Not, you do not need any.

243
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,430
If you want it, go ahead and take it along.

244
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,540
In any event, somebody as him will not leave so easily.

245
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,670
Its heart carries deep scars,

246
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,480
broad wounds that even me I cannot cure.

247
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,700
You see, since the day of his birth,
it was given up by his parents and his clan.

248
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,570
All that because it had the blue nose.

249
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,080
It always went only to the variation of the herd.

250
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,320
We speak about a young fawn at this time.

251
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,460
Then one day, he ate one of the fruits of the demon and was treated like a monster.

252
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,990
He was rejected by the remainder of his herd.

253
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,080
He had completely ceased being a normal reindeer.

254
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,350
All that it wished, it was to have of the friends.

255
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,810
Under its human form,
he moved towards a village.

256
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,510
Eh. What is it that this trick?

257
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,830
But it did not resemble for as much human.

258
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,980
Its truffle in particular remained blue.

259
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,920
It arrives! The abominable snowman!

260
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,590
It is dangerous! Make return the children in the houses, quickly!

261
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,510
With the weapons! Take your weapons!

262
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,440
Kill it!

263
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,910
Salt monster!

264
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,060
Leave!

265
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,670
Fire! Fire!

266
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,550
Do not let it escape!
It takes refuge in the mountains!

267
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,250
It did not include/understand what it had done of evil.

268
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,580
It did not even know with which to be caught some.

269
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,530
SALT MONSTER!

270
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,000
All that he wanted, they was friends, but instead of that, he was made treat monster.

271
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,910
He was not any more one reindeer…

272
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,920
but not human either.

273
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,710
Then he lived alone, delivered to itself.

274
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,540
Will you be able to fill this vacuum in his heart?

275
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,060
Eh Luffy, looks at this door.

276
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,190
It is the main entrance.

277
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,460
And it is large open.

278
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,060
Not astonishing that it is so cold.

279
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,650
Finally at all events, let us close it.

280
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,410
There is no difference between the interior and outside with this open large door.

281
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,660
HE!

282
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,380
Stop!

283
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,140
Do not touch with this door!

284
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,080
Be unaware of it, close it!

285
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,730
One will finish cold.

286
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,680
Ouais, you ace reason.

287
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,610
HE YOU!

288
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,420
YOU DO NOT INCLUDE/UNDERSTAND…

289
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,840
… WHAT I WANT TO SAY BY “STOP”!?

290
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,740
Waaaaaaaah!!

291
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,780
Why he is irritated like that!?

292
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,540
Hey, Luffy.

293
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,000
Come to see by here.

294
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,170
Look at up there.

295
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,720
Snowbirds babies.

296
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,280
The nest would have fallen if we had closed the door.

297
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,880
It is for that it left it open.

298
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,580
Cold fact!

299
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,740
Cold!

300
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,370
Wait one minute.

301
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,530
What?

302
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,200
It has just spoken there, not?

303
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,240
Yes…

304
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,150
And it went upright…

305
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,460
It IS a MONSTER!

306
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,230
Q - What is it!?

307
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,280
If it holds upright…

308
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,850
… and that it resembles a reindeer…

309
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,910
… and it has a fur…

310
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,360
… and it is small…

311
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,830
… and then it becomes large…

312
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,170
… It IS a MONSTER!

313
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,090
I adore it!

314
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,440
Too much cool!

315
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,550
Sanji!

316
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,360
Let us take it in our crew!

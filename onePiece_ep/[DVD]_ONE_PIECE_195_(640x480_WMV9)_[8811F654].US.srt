1
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,659
Then?!

2
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,249
They are always with our cases?!

3
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,829
It would be said that they gave up!

4
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,169
I see them nowhere!

5
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,830
Oh, it is a good news.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,590
Brothel, this monstrous gun made me flipper!

7
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,750
But where could they hide that well?

8
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,629
A gun?

9
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,969
Do Ouais, you remember?

10
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,710
This enormous trick that the warriors carried!

11
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,389
Oh, that?

12
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,889
“OH, CA”?!

13
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,229
What does not go at home? Y' has anything funny!

14
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,519
It is for that they would run us afterwards!

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,390
Ouais! Do not laugh!

16
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,769
He, look at! It is Nami and Conis!

17
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,640
Oh, Nami-swan! Conis-chwan!

18
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,859
Is all well?

19
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,579
Of course!

20
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:53,470
Blue Sea finally!!
Final weaves by the emotion

21
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,669
What?

22
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,839
They fled the island?

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,009
Yes, we will never on the occasion to express our gratitude to them.

24
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,290
Which tragedy.

25
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,130
Do they know at least that we are indebted for them?

26
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,500
Yes.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,639
I must admit it.

28
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,260
They absolutely do not have any empathy for the others.

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,479
You were right to do that, Aisa.

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,840
To keep yourself the secrecy.

31
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,850
Everyone made of din because of our heroes who ran away themselves.

32
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,599
But Luffy and the others said that it had to be said to anybody!

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,119
Their do you have says at least something, Aisa?

34
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,240
Ouaip! I said to them thank you.

35
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,259
He, Laki, guess what!

36
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,080
Luffy can also extend its arm far it wishes it!

37
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,969
Gomu Gomu No Pistol!

38
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,799
He, Aisa, remain quiet.

39
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
It there also of the strong warriors on the Blue Sea.

40
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,310
I would like to also be like that one day. Gomu Gomu!

41
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,559
Aisa.

42
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,210
Hum?

43
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,809
I make you just a small cut today.

44
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,670
You require that your hair pushes back.

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,149
I think that will suit you well.

46
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,980
Isn't a girl must be nice?

47
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,859
NICE?!!

48
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,810
Me?

49
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,060
Exactly.

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,070
You will not have to carry weapons any more.

51
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,330
You can live free, like any inhabitant of the celestial island.

52
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,790
Be really sympathetic today for you, Laki!

53
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,469
He, Aisa, stop moving.

54
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,849
Laki the sympathetic one!

55
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,580
Aisa!

56
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,430
Large Karugara Warrior.

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,930
I intended to say that the duty of Shandia had been accomplished.

58
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,100
And your last wish reached your friend.

59
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,570
The future generations will not have to pour their blood any more again.

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,110
The war is finished.

61
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,350
But, we will not lose our pride!

62
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,420
Therefore, please, continue to protect us.

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,540
I promise that the Flame of Shandora will die out never again!

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,740
I am the Knight of the Sky, a free mercenary.

65
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,380
This country does not require it any more.

66
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,390
Now, this country needs somebody to control it.

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,660
And I believe that you are that which will achieve best this task.

68
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,309
You are our enemies.

69
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,649
This city was yours in the past.

70
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,560
This does not have any direction.

71
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,079
That does not justify all.

72
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,060
This war taught it to us with all.

73
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,780
Nobody can have Vearth.

74
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,089
God is a support.

75
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,160
This country is Skypiea. This city is Shandora.

76
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,470
Only a man who deplored this war can link them.

77
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,630
This man, it is you.

78
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,809
Knight of the Sky, Gan Fall.

79
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,119
Please, accept
new the divine throne of God…

80
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,920
and support this deeply ravaged ground.

81
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,439
We also want that you returned!

82
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,999
Gan Fall-sama!

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,819
We are all of agreement us too!

84
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,899
Ouais!

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,159
Gan Fall!

86
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,409
God!

87
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,270
Please, return us!

88
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,400
Honestly.

89
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,700
Just at the moment when I thought of being able to benefit from the harvest of my pumpkin piece…

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,109
He, everyone, it is there!

91
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,659
Look in front!

92
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,199
It is Cloud End!

93
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,810
Ouah, lets see me!

94
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,699
Then, one can go down by there?

95
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,110
One quickly arrived.

96
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,829
Does Ah, one return already?

97
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,660
You ace reason. It is hard to think that one from goes away finally.

98
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,209
We will leave this white sea.

99
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,469
It is sure, the celestial island was fun!

100
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,950
But it was a little frightening too.

101
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,510
It seems that after having passed this door, Milky Road kills us on the Blue Sea.

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,019
You think that one will return one day on the celestial island?

103
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,930
Ca would be well.

104
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,649
Ok, everyone, I am sorry!

105
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,989
We cannot go further!

106
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,020
Take care of you!

107
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,529
Thank you to say to us goodbye!

108
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,329
Conis-chan, take care of you!

109
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,360
Thank everyone too for our share!

110
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,900
With more!

111
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,740
Thank you for all!

112
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,879
Not!

113
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,160
It is with us to thank you for all!

114
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,960
We will never forget you!

115
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,089
Conis, Grandfather, made attention with you!

116
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,129
Yes!

117
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,420
Now, please, your veils and you stud arrange!

118
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,429
Ok, let us do what he says!

119
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,639
One starts to accelerate!

120
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,559
Well, the road is with 7 kilometers height!

121
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,409
Grouillez you!

122
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,960
OUAIS!

123
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,220
What, what?!

124
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,659
“Do not leave without me!”

125
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,860
Ah, the Bird of the South which we accidentally brought on the celestial island.

126
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,659
Well, Captain!

127
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,110
The Log is pointed on the next island!

128
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,589
Ouais, they is good!

129
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,670
When one is in bottom, one
a new adventure will start!

130
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,410
The guy!

131
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,240
Be ready!

132
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,139
ONE TURNS OVER ON THE BLUE SEA!

133
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,910
OUAIS!

134
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,380
How everyone is careful during the freefall!

135
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,760
The freefall?

136
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,980
Heso!

137
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,089
It left!

138
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,130
Living White Sea, Takoballoon!

139
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,269
AN OCTOPUS!

140
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,100
Why you…

141
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,520
Q-Q-qu-what?

142
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,199
He, come to see!

143
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,180
It is a trick of insane!

144
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,619
It is what this thing?!

145
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,520
A balloon!

146
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,619
They is too cool!

147
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,749
We slowed down!

148
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,919
I… I…

149
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,200
thought that I was going to die.

150
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,899
Sound it!

151
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,200
Send to the heroes of this country the tinkling of the Bell!

152
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,520
Heso!

153
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,119
Luffy, return quickly!

154
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
Still return!

155
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,709
Thank you with you!

156
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,790
Return healthy and safe on the Blue Sea!

157
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,880
When it sometimes happens to you to throw a glance in the sky…

158
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,889
Although that can be a legend,

159
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,520
think that the country of God floats up there, of 10.000 meters above you.

160
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,099
If you tighten the ear,
you will hear the tinkling of a bell.

161
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,439
It sounds today.

162
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,420
It will sound still tomorrow.

163
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,140
This bell sounds top of the skies, coming from a floating country…

164
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,020
and its pride sings.

165
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,449
They is sympathetic!

166
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,940
Ouais, I adore that!

167
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,940
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

168
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,250
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

169
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,509
You give up exploration?

170
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,969
Of course!

171
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,479
The Gold City was in the sky.

172
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,689
We will not find anything at the ocean floor.

173
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,729
The things are finished now.

174
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,260
There is no reason to remain here, apart from our pride.

175
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,010
Owner?

176
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,989
Owner?

177
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,409
I owe you all my gratitude for all that you did.

178
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,369
You supported my daring dream during so many years.

179
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,779
That seems…

180
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,159
so far!

181
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,400
Then, the guy!

182
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,530
In which adventure one will launch out now?

183
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,000
We will follow you anywhere, Patron!

184
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,849
Gold!

185
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,929
Gold!

186
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,969
Gold!

187
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,099
Gold!

188
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,309
Gold!

189
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,759
One is rich finally!

190
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,439
What could one buy?

191
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,809
Why not a énooooorme statue of bronze?!

192
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,909
Imbecile!

193
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,099
Why you would exchange gold against bronze?!

194
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,149
Guns should be bought!

195
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,739
One will buy Ten of them! Ten guns!

196
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,159
Nami-san! I would like a refrigerator with a lock!

197
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,119
It is stupid!

198
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,579
I want… I want…

199
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,949
I want to buy books!

200
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,289
I would like to read books of medicine of other countries!

201
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,449
It IS FOR CA THAT I GO
TO BUY, DRAFT!

202
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,780
Await the guy!

203
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,909
One must initially land before being able to start to divide the treasure!

204
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,810
Please, buys to me books!

205
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,119
One did not leave the inn if I let to you buy all that you want.

206
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,700
Madam Navigatrice?

207
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,389
Where does the boat go?

208
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,509
Where?

209
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,410
The next island, of…

210
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,799
What is there?

211
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,769
It occurs what?

212
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,760
What occurs, Nami-san?

213
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,189
Fact of shitting.

214
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,520
One took an airstream and we deviate of our trajectory!

215
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,779
An airstream?

216
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,819
Now that I think of it, I feel a breeze.

217
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,279
Does Ca fear?

218
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,529
Of course that yes!

219
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,270
Now we do not know where we will land!

220
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,029
What does one make?

221
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,110
With the octopus, we cannot set the sails to control ourselves the boat.

222
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,079
He, does not worry you for that!

223
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,830
Once the sea will have been taken, one will go to the next island!

224
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,289
You still speak without knowing, like always.

225
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,650
But, wait…

226
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,129
A problem, Sanji-kun?

227
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,719
Not, it must be my imagination.

228
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,090
Hein? How that?

229
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,129
Not, nothing.

230
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,999
Look at over there!

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,290
He!

232
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,689
What, it was a dream?

233
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,019
BROTHEL, WHAT
DO NOT TURN OUT BADLY AT HOME?!

234
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,859
I WILL KILL YOU, DRAFT!

235
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,779
I will throw you over edge!

236
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,859
You made us die fear!

237
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,769
Moron!

238
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:58,180
Zoro! Ca gives what?!

239
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,329
The sun lay down for the day.

240
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,159
But the sight remains sympathetic.

241
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,820
Ouais, you ace reason!

242
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,649
Hein? Already the morning?

243
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,959
It grows dark, cretin!

244
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,629
Ca takes time before reaching the Blue Sea.

245
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,220
I still wonder until where we will derive from our main roads.

246
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,929
He! And if I sang you one
impassioned love song?

247
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,330
Buckle it!

248
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,679
This rate/rhythm, one will be made carry until Raftel.

249
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,439
Usopp, it is incredible!

250
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,139
It is impossible.

251
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,230
We have even more half of Large Line to cross before reaching Raftel.

252
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,399
Ah, ouais, ok…

253
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,760
I knew it.

254
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,489
Brothel, one is bored.

255
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,569
How long still before we land?

256
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,239
Turn over to lie down.

257
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,159
If are awaked to you, come by-there, Zoro!

258
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,530
It east is delirious!

259
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,249
Hein? Luffy?

260
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,789
From where can it shout well?

261
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,879
It was as if it were rather far.

262
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,879
Are Luffy, to you where?

263
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,839
Up there!

264
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,469
The guy, go up too!

265
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,240
It is too funny!

266
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,210
Shit, I knew it!

267
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,210
They is too cool! Too much cool!

268
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,689
He, do not do anything stupid, Luffy!

269
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,689
Our lives depend on this balloon!

270
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,560
They is good! They is good!

271
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,859
Stop, Luffy!

272
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,100
Go down again!

273
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,869
He, Luffy, stop!

274
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,829
Why you shout, Sanji-kun?

275
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,679
The octopus narrows!

276
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,789
This rate/rhythm, one will fall!

277
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,659
What?!

278
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,560
He, Luffy!

279
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,039
What doesn't go?

280
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,919
The octopus narrows!

281
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,669
What?!

282
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,169
Now that I look at it, it seems a little smaller.

283
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,239
One does what?

284
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,159
One is still in high-altitude!

285
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,130
Will it hold until one lands?

286
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,759
He, Luffy!

287
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,170
Y' has a problem! Go down!

288
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,399
I flippé!

289
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,569
Ca has right decree to rebound!

290
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,400
I had said it to you, the octopus narrows!

291
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,030
Hein? I fall again.

292
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,290
One falls! One falls!

293
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,419
Oh not! At this speed, one will be crushed on the sea!

294
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,259
If the sea is touched, nothing will be able to save us!

295
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,089
Really?! Fact of shitting…

296
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,299
What will you make, Usopp?

297
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,900
How I would know it?!

298
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,870
I will save the boat!

299
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,809
What you will make?!

300
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,720
Do not make the nutcase, Usopp!

301
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,519
usopp…

302
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,770
aaaaaaaaaaaa

303
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,360
Well, I succeeded!

304
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,390
Good!

305
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,190
[Note:Breath = Breath]

306
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,950
Ok, now fleet!

307
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,459
One slowed down!

308
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,820
Ouah!

309
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,299
One is saved?

310
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,200
It seems that it is the case.

311
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,469
You have all considering my moment of glory?

312
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,380
Usopp, you are incredible!

313
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,349
I had the jitter during one minute!

314
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,519
Me too.

315
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,590
I thought that we were lost.

316
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,420
WHAT?!

317
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,550
Usopp!

318
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,730
The guy, you with something hang!

319
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,330
Nami-san, Robin-chan, you are well?!

320
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,799
I was afraid!

321
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,469
The octopus has narrows blow very!

322
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,139
I think that it did not have any more air.

323
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,960
How it occurred?!

324
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,389
But, one succeeded!

325
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,599
Without dying!

326
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,550
He, thank you!

327
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,550
But…

328
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,689
Which crowned place.

329
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,699
After being returned here low, that seems so much far.

330
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,980
Almost like if we had dreamed.

331
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,819
It is the country of the dreams.

332
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,579
I wonder whether we will go back one day there.

333
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,150
You will go up there when you die. Or some share not far.

334
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,320
Zoro, are you sure that you will go to the Paradise?

335
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,869
Species of moron!

336
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,539
Well, all is calm now.

337
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,209
I will make coffee.

338
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,209
I want puff out, Sanji!

339
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,799
I will make some, therefore wood your coffee and patient!

340
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,670
Of course!

341
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,240
In any event…

342
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,180
But…

343
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,020
where we are?

1
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:09,000
Let us take again our memories!

2
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:09,000
The pirates unload on the island!

3
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,630
There is no doubt, it is me which wrote that…

4
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,850
Sorajima, the naval base J-8, and all this gold…

5
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,370
if it is true, all becomes coherent.

6
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,270
If I return to the Kokoyashi village I will include/understand certainly all

7
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,750
but… how could I go there without a good ship…

8
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,960
in more we are in GrandLine?!!

9
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,590
According to this plan, one cannot leave in EstBlue halfway….

10
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Wh… What???

11
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,950
It is you which are the capitainnnneee?!!

12
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,910
Hehehe… you had chance.

13
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,980
If I would not be recalled, one would be always the subordinates of Usopp.

14
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,500
Keep silent yourself! I will never believe myself!

15
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,060
No matter what you say, it is me the large pirate who is with the head of 8000 men.

16
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,740
The large captain of pirates, Usopp Captain.

17
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,090
Hahahaha, I recognize Usopp well.

18
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,110
But!! You are the gunner of the crew of the straw hat.

19
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,920
Shiiit… the roles were reversed…

20
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,650
It… It is a monster like me, but he is captain.

21
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,400
Chopper.

22
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,690
Ouaahhhhhh

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,910
Do not come here.

24
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,500
You still say this kind of silly things, you?

25
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,400
Let us play as usual

26
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,870
Did Ze ........ ze make well really this zenre zoses ford ze would be a ship's doctor…?

27
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,100
Yes!! It is your favorite number.

28
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,610
You always did it during the banquets.

29
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,920
This elastic monkey. he says to have to find the memory but,

30
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,510
he did not change at all.

31
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,190
I.e. that the captain does not change no matter what it arrives.

32
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,730
They call in vain me pirate, if I am ordinary, there is strong chancse that one me refile the dirty job.

33
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,970
Moreover, if I am with such monsters, even if I have several lives, Ca will not be enough for me!

34
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,270
It is clearly now.

35
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,250
You did not lose the memory but it was concealed to you,

36
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,620
and of course the criminal is…

37
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,930
It is which this horrible brat…

38
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,980
Eh… that is what it will make of our memories?

39
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,790
I do not know.

40
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,030
Aaaahhh!! Zut--

41
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:17,490
Hein??

42
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,480
It is necessary to go to seek Nami and Zoro.

43
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,820
One goes there! You all!

44
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,970
Let us wait the morning.

45
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,390
Hein? Why that Robin?

46
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,350
It is extremely difficult to especially find them on an unknown territory of night.

47
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,680
Hum… it is true.

48
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,270
It is not better to rest until the lever du soleil?

49
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,860
The boy had a good correction.

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,480
I think that it will not be shown any more this evening.

51
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,130
Hum… I included/understood!

52
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,210
Then… it is decided, we will leave tomorrow morning!

53
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,180
Wait a little!

54
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,600
Ah??

55
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,510
There are no problems to bring back the LADY, Nami-san but

56
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,790
I am not agreement for Zoro.

57
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,060
Me too!

58
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,330
If you want to go there, go ahead to two!

59
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,340
Me… also…

60
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,120
What is what you said there?

61
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,320
I just asked why one needed Zoro too.

62
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,640
It is a hunter of pirates him!

63
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,720
And why does one have to try hard of going to seek it…?

64
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,100
It is normal!

65
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,730
It is because it is our nakama.

66
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,400
Even if you say to us that it is our nakama. hein the guy?

67
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,820
He does not even know this feeling.

68
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,430
You also, you noticed it.

69
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,200
The proof, it left as soon as it could.

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,690
Usopp is the gunner.

71
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,830
Sandy, the cock.

72
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,200
Chopper, the ship's doctor.

73
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,780
Robin, the archeologist.

74
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,060
Nami, the navigatrice.

75
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,710
And finally Zoro, the swashbuckler.

76
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,380
It is not necessary that it misses would be this only one person in our crew Straw hat!!

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,030
We did not have other means only of taking again the memories of Kenshi-san.

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,400
If it is that, it is enough to botter the bottom of this kid to the coat not?

79
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,810
As presently…

80
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,100
Hein Chopper?

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,560
Ahh… I feel that tomorrow, one will be occupied.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,420
Let us sleep for the moment.

83
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,670
The key to solve all the problems is…

84
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,220
certainly on this island.

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,400
I underestimated it a little too much.

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,510
Monkey D. Luffy… it could be an embarrassing adversary.

87
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,280
But… I will carry out this wish at all costs.

88
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,130
For that, I must be made nakama…

89
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,490
A powerful swashbuckler will make the deal.

90
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,640
Huhu, huhuhahaha

91
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,500
It is true… it is different from yesterday.

92
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,370
It is the hunter of pirates… if I approach too much, I am likely to make the same silly thing.

93
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,680
Of agreement… Let us stop there for the moment.

94
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,150
I will on many other occasions.

95
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,500
And at this time there… you will work well for me.

96
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,350
The place where all are the vivres world… Allblue.

97
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,550
I dreamed to go on this legendary sea.

98
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,050
Interfere your business.

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,000
I did not ask so that you would be nice with me!

100
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,890
Say me why?! Why!!

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,060
Because you have the same dream as me.

102
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,980
Restaurant…

103
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,290
Yes… I wanted to build it, it was my last reason to live.

104
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,460
Yosh! Me also I will help you! Thus do not die yet!

105
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,540
Pff! It is impossible for a kid skinny fellow like you.

106
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,800
I will be strong!

107
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,940
It is not believable which I can move away from the filthy old man with which I owe the life.

108
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,060
Why? What is what it arrived to me?

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,990
Pepper, Ninjin, Tamanegui… which does make the crew of Usopp in this moment?

110
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,990
[Ninjin= Carrot; Tamanegui= Onion]

111
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,340
Yosh! The crew of Usopp ahead! To protect peace in this village!

112
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,680
And thus? Today, you tell me which adventure??

113
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,050
Ahh today… good…

114
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,950
It is the history of my battle against gigantic a poisson rouge in the tropical sea when I was 5 years old.

115
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,090
A poisson rouge?

116
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,340
What has me most surprised it was the length and the width of its shit

117
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,930
and I unloaded above thinking that it was a continent

118
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,010
Hahahaha
Huhuhuhu

119
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,560
I had the dream to become a pirate like my father

120
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,120
but… to drop them to become pirate…

121
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,430
Why am I with the human ones?

122
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,490
I rely only on Doctor Hiluluk and Doctorine.

123
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,160
Even among the reindeers, I did not have a friend and I was all alone…

124
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,070
I will never strike myself…

125
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,200
My name is Doctor Hiluluk. I am a doctor!

126
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,530
That wants to say that there does not exist terminal illness!

127
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,070
Even if people say anything.

128
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,400
I will save this country as a doctor!

129
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,860
Thus… I wove this mark of tête de mort to fight against all the diseases!

130
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,810
Tête de mort?

131
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,310
Eh yes! It is the emblem of my solid conviction.

132
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,810
I will carry this symbol and will beat me like a pirate!!

133
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,750
And yet they are my Nakama?

134
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,620
Moreover they are 6…

135
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,990
I cannot believe that I am the ship's doctor of a ship of pirates…

136
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,720
but… and if it were true?

137
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,580
It will not disappear!

138
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,580
My dream will never disappear

139
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,940
and it must be similar for you!

140
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,780
Nami! Zoro! Wait, one arrives us…

141
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
You awake the guy…!

142
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,790
One is already awaked for a long time.

143
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,260
The cock and the ship's doctor accompany us too.

144
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:52,900
Ah?

145
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,150
I will not drop the LADY,

146
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,180
and Robin-san needs also a BODYGUARD.

147
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,760
If somebody were wounded, it would be embarrassing if a doctor were not there, not?

148
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,820
And thus… I undertake to keep the ship.

149
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,050
Usopp you come too!

150
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,560
But. euhh… in fact… I am reached of a disease of the heart. It stops when I unload on an island… aieeee aieeee…

151
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,520
It is not serious, come!!

152
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,740
Me I know…

153
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,430
that one can count on Usopp, the valorous warrior of the seas.

154
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,130
Mouais

155
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,740
Oups….

156
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,950
Yooosh! One goes there all…

157
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,860
Zuuut… I let myself go…

158
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,380
And…. how is one to the island?

159
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,110
Why not build a raft?

160
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,380
Ouaaiiiis it is an good idea.

161
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,760
I entrust this Usopp load to you.

162
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
Me?!!!

163
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,140
I am the Usopp captain!!

164
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,110
Ok Ok.

165
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,750
In the worst of the cases, I am a gunner… in all the cases, I will not be able to never make like a carpenter.

166
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,350
To manufacture a raft, it is simply enough to assemble the trunks, not??

167
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,370
It is easy! Easy!

168
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,360
Are the manner of making the nodes… sure for you that they is good?

169
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,650
Ouais. I think.

170
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,320
Hey, hey… these nodes will be demolished and the raft will be dislocated.

171
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,470
If it is that, it is to have a beautiful raft better.

172
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,220
What said some?

173
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,730
Nan! This one is more beautiful…

174
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,160
I would say rather than this one is with my taste!

175
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,680
Ehhhhh!! What a pirate doesnot can build a raft correctly!!

176
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,200
Pff!

177
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,400
Ohhhh

178
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,090
It is very beautiful work
it is very well done

179
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,840
I had said it to you that one can count on Usopp!

180
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
grr… I do not even know why I was bored to manufacture a raft…

181
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,490
YOSHA!! On the way!!

182
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,890
Thank you for all.

183
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,690
Be to you which you?

184
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,580
Hein? I am that which took a room here yesterday.

185
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,080
You know it??

186
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,960
Not I do not know this person.

187
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,860
It is not a robber by chance??

188
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,980
WHAT?!!

189
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,920
Eh! Wait a little! Me I am your customer!

190
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,920
I met you all the three.

191
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,340
You really forgot me??

192
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,280
Mister the manager,

193
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,700
Manager? Me?

194
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,650
Hein.? It… is the manager not?

195
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,980
Good Ah?

196
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,510
I was likely to be able to sleep gratuitememt.

197
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,640
But. I wonder what it occurs here…

198
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,080
it is not.!!

199
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,320
Who… are you?

200
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,680
You also you lost the memory?

201
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,340
They are like me yesterday.

202
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,080
It was yesterday??

203
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,610
Yes! It is thought that they came in this village.

204
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,270
It is a swashbuckler with a head of MARIMO and a girl on an odd machine

205
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,270
[Marimo:green watery plant which has a round form]

206
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,440
You did not see them??

207
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,770
Yesterday… What is what I did yesterday??

208
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,720
You aussiiii?!!!!!

209
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,720
Argg!! How is ce qui' they have all on this island?!

210
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,140
All as long as they are… Why do not remember they what they did yesterday?!

211
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,890
Hahahaha they all are carefree!

212
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,200
Be sure for you that they are simplememt there carefree?

213
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,190
One can say some as much…

214
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,850
us also….

215
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,660
It may be that the reason is the same one.

216
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,930
What does one make now? In this situation…

217
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,120
it will be difficult to find them.

218
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,830
Yosh! Let us turn over on the ship.

219
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,740
One will gain nothing good to remain on this sinister island

220
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,020
Hein? Said yes.

221
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,060
Nami

222
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,120
Shit…

223
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,330
Wait a little

224
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,680
Ha… It is the hell…

225
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,320
Why you flee Nami?

226
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,470
I will never give myself that.

227
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,760
Even if one kills to me!!

228
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,800
Nevertheless!

229
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,730
To carry reached to a young lady like you, it is foolish!

230
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,020
One will not pose even a finger on you!

231
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,040
But in truth, I want very of it.

232
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,640
It which disease there has?

233
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,420
Make something Doctor!

234
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,740
I know that it is very serious but I also know that one cannot look after it.

235
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,520
Good… let us make a market.

236
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,810
A market??

237
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,220
I give you 10% of this treasure and you take me along until Kokoyashi.

238
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,340
Not.

239
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,180
Then 20% does, that suit you?

240
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,100
Not.

241
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,660
then 30%

242
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,320
not

243
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,390
50%!!

244
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,140
Not.

245
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,710
It would be necessary for you how much to be satisfied you!!

246
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,970
Love you too the treasures.

247
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,240
I know that you do not even intend to give me my share, hein?

248
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,470
How you know what I think…

249
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,040
Hahaha! Of course that I know it!

250
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,010
Since you are my nakama.

251
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,670
It is out of the question which I would be your nakama!

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,180
It is not possible.

253
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,440
The negotiations are stopped.

254
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:44,960
Goodbye.

255
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,740
Push!

256
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,800
Not I will not move…

257
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,720
Nami!! You must come with me!

258
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,730
What?! It is a joke?!

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,640
Why should I go with you?

260
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,050
Push!!

261
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,150
I do not move

262
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,370
Navigatrice.

263
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,300
You have to have a strange impression when you arrived on this island…

264
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,160
is not this step?

265
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,890
What does it have T there big sister?

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,870
An odd child….with a flute.

267
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,820
I have boot to him the bottom!!

268
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,780
Then a smoke escaped from its flute to enter my body and…

269
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,500
The memory of the captain returned.

270
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,060
Incredible.

271
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,880
You dreamed or what?

272
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,840
It is the truth.

273
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,900
Me also, I saw it my own eyes.

274
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,380
I have the impression that this kid was there day before yesterday too.

275
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,060
Why did it come one second time?

276
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,430
It is not because it did not can steal you your memory in only once?

277
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,190
According to what I know about you, you lived much adventures.

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,040
Not being able all to eat…

279
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,290
it returned yesterday while being always hungry.

280
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,390
Yes… It must be that…

281
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,070
Ohhh! Does Ca have a good taste the memory??

282
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,750
Then this child…

283
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,970
Go! So long

284
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,410
Yosha! This small kid should be found…

285
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,520
to take again your memories.

286
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,620
Then Zoro will certainly return.

287
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,380
I wonder whether it is as simple as that but

288
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,350
in any case, it is necessary that I return the currency of his coin to him to this small snotty-nosed kid.

289
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,060
Said… Let us drop Zoro…

290
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,190
even if it found the memory.

291
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,690
I will not feel at ease on a ship where a hunter of pirates is.

292
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,210
Zoro is our swashbuckler…

293
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,240
and Nami our navigatrice.

294
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,170
They are our nakama and one absolutely needs them!

295
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,410
Even if you say that to me, that does nothing but embarrass me!

296
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,460
Me… to be your nakama…

297
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,500
If you were not there, I would be embarrassed even more than you!!

298
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,580
The ship could not advance without the navigatrice not!!!

299
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,510
Robin! Is what you can know where is this kid?

300
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,440
Let us see… I would like to examine a place…

301
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,120
Yosh! One goes there!!

302
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,790
He! Gold!

303
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,750
I will not let a young lady carry a so heavy load!

304
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,430
If I can remain with Nami-san, there is no problem.

305
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,730
Argg… I have a bad presentiment…

306
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,450
No matter what one can say… everyone follows Luffy.

307
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,020
Is what it is true that I had of the nakama.

308
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,820
How is what you do! Come quickly Chopper!

309
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,560
Yes!!

310
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,160
If you want to eat, be useful make you as at home.

311
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,550
I am hungry but…

312
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,240
I do not eat this kind of thing me.

313
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,260
Good Ah.

314
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,500
Why me requests you not which I am?

315
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,750
Ahh you thought ace that it was useless me to require it because the inhabitants of this island do not even know their name

316
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,050
Did Onii-chan you leave on a journey to be strongest of the world not?

317
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,120
Then, Monkey D. Luffy will be an adversary with your size.

318
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,600
Me I am called magic Luffy.

319
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,040
Pff! This guy with the straw hat?

320
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,870
Oh… I am surprised that Roronoa Zoro did not can detect the power of this type.

321
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,570
I did not can detect it?

322
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,330
Eh yes… In EastBlue, it exterminated the band of the pirates man-fish, the crew of Arlong Park

323
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,660
And in this sea, GrandLine, it overcame all alone Crocodile, one of the seven Shichibukai.

324
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,170
Shichibukai?

325
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,650
And it is not all

326
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,690
it has even botter the bottom with a god named Eneru on Sorajima.

327
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,480
Ah yes!! He baited himself on the basis of marine!

328
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,390
Even the navy cannot anything against Luffy.

329
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,250
Hahahahaha! I ever saw such a pirate.

330
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,240
Do not make fun of me!

331
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,100
I do not have time for these cock-and-bull stories

332
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,770
You does ace envy to beat you against Luffy is not this step?

333
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,500
Hehehehehe

334
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,290
That devil you…

335
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,730
Hahahahahaha

336
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,370
Hum?? It is here?

337
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,230
It is here that is the odd kid?

338
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,460
It is lugubrious here.

339
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,270
Am Ahh… I caught cold or what?

340
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,570
Since presently, I do not stop shivering.

341
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,380
So at least there was a doctor in these cases.

342
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,380
BUT It IS ME!!!

343
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,940
These people… they intend well to take me along in a place where there is nobody to steal me my gold.

344
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,910
I will not let to you make!!

345
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,590
Since presently, Nami-san directs its hot glances on me.

346
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,150
There is no doubt… it fell in love with me!

347
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,640
Hihihihihihi patiko-N!!

348
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,000
[Patiko-N:onomatopoeia which indicates the noise of the wink]

349
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,570
Qu… what?!?!

350
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,840
It is a sign to say to me that it will conceal me gold?!

351
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,340
It is an odd man that one

352
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,120
I see.

353
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,210
Ah! A butterfly!

354
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,650

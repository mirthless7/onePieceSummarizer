1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,250
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,150
The man who had acquired everything in this 
world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,890
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,570
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,500
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,220
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,010
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,330
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,320
Sogeking.

10
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,580
Make that flag burst into flames.

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,910
Roger that.

12
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,380
My new weapon, the Great Pachinko.

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,750
Going by the name of Kabuto! Closely behold its power!

14
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,940
No way...

15
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,610
Done.

16
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,440
Are you out of your mind!?

17
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,990
Don't think you'll be able to survive having the world as your enemy!

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,490
YOU WANNA BET!?

19
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,580
Robin!

20
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,750
I still haven't heard it from your mouth!

21
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,260
SAY YOU WANT TO LIVE!!

22
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,390
Robin...

23
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,980
Robin!

24
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,610
Live...

25
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,240
I thought wishing for it was forbidden...

26
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,700
Nobody would allow me that...

27
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,160
The sea is vast.

28
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,210
Someday, without any doubt,

29
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,460
nakama who will protect you will appear!

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,350
If I'm really allowed to declare my wish...

31
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,940
Then I...

32
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,480
I WANT TO LIVE!!

33
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,530
TAKE ME OUT TO THE SEA WITH YOU!!

34
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,720
I love you guys!

35
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,800
Damn it!

36
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,560
Let's go!

37
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,690
The drawbridge is lowering!

38
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,770
Looks like it went well on those guys' side.

39
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,730
That's great.

40
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,320
Robin!

41
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,740
We absolutely will save you!

42
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,280
The drawbridge is lowering!

43
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,160
Go, Straw Hat-san!!

44
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,740
Damn you, pirates!

45
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,410
We won't let you!

46
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,670
Prepare the mortar cannon!

47
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,460
Stop the drawbridge even if you have to blow it up!

48
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,920
Yes!

49
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,720
The drawbridge stopped!?

50
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,390
They're getting in our way!

51
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,680
What is this!? Damn it!

52
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,770
Who was it!?

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,190
Oi, pirates!

54
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,940
Kokoro-san?

55
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,690
I can hear everything. Why are you wasting your time there?

56
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,990
Wasting our time? But the bridge is only half lowered...

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Jump into the waterfall with all your heart!

58
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,910
The seatrain...

59
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,120
Heh!

60
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,500
What's with that "Heh!" while smiling?

61
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,970
Let's go!

62
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,780
I wouldn't have taken you with me anyway!

63
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,280
As if someone like you could become a pirate!

64
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,490
I will!

65
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,450
Someday, I'll gather nakama who won't lose to this crew,

66
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,570
find the greatest treasure in the world,

67
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,790
and I'll definitely become the Pirate King!

68
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,420
When I was a kid, I swore to gather nakama and become the Pirate King.

69
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,090
To the pirate who protected me...

70
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,340
You're already my nakama.

71
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,550
Robin...

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,890
Just like the pirate who protected me,

73
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,600
I'll protect you too!

74
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,790
Pass some here, oi!

75
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,470
Then take me on your next voyage, Shanks!

76
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,760
I want to become a pirate too!

77
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,850
As if someone like you could become a pirate!

78
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,180
Why not!?

79
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,860
Luffy, no matter how well you can swim, you can't become a pirate just like that.

80
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,690
I'm strong in fights too! My punch is like a pistol!

81
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,860
Ah, is that so?

82
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,530
What's with that tone!?

83
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,450
Basically, Luffy's just a kid.

84
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,620
You're the same age as my kid you know.

85
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm not a kid! I'm an adult already!

86
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,700
Don't get so angry.

87
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,500
Here, drink some juice.

88
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,330
Thanks!

89
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,630
See!? You're a kid!

90
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,590
That's dirty, Shanks!

91
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,970
Stop laughing!

92
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,390
What!? Damn you Shanks!

93
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,270
Sorry for intruding.

94
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,410
Oh, so these are the so-called pirates.

95
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,030
They all have such idiotic mugs...

96
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,290
Welcome.

97
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,880
We are bandits.

98
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,760
We didn't come to break havoc in this bar...

99
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,380
Sell us some sake.

100
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,880
We need ten barrels.

101
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,220
I'm really sorry.

102
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,680
We're short on sake at the moment.

103
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,560
This is pretty weird.

104
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,600
These pirates are drinking something, is it water?

105
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,310
As I told you, the sake you can see is everything we have.

106
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,440
We did something bad.

107
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,110
We drank all of the sake.

108
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,780
Sorry.

109
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,700
If this is alright, you can have it.

110
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,660
The bottle cap is still on.

111
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,830
The bounty on my head is worth $8,000,000...

112
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,550
A single bottle of sake is far from being enough.

113
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,210
Don't underestimate me.

114
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,470
Now the floor's completely wet.

115
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,100
I'm sorry about that, Makino-san.

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,640
Do you have a dry cloth?

117
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,770
Ah, I'll do it.

118
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,400
It seems you like cleaning up.

119
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,820
With this, it'll be worth doing it.

120
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,740
If there's no sake, then there's no need to discuss this.

121
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,830
Let's move out!

122
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,370
Seeya, cowards.

123
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,850
Are you alright?

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,990
Captain-san, are you injured?

125
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,970
No, I'm alright. It's no problem.

126
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,060
You really were done over by that guy, boss!

127
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,730
How ridiculous!

128
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,230
Why are you all laughing!?

129
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,330
Wasn't that uncool!?

130
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Why didn't you fight him!?

131
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,950
No matter how numerous or how strong they are,

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,910
you're not a man if you laugh after something like this happens to you!

133
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,030
You're not a pirate!

134
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,960
It's not that I don't understand how you feel...

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,020
But they only spilled some sake.

136
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,910
It's not worth getting angry over, is it?

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,050
I don't care anymore!

138
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
Gobbling it up, Luffy?

139
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,470
Shaddap!

140
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,100
What are you eating!?

141
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,740
Was it this box!?

142
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,940
Did you eat what was inside this box!?

143
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,760
Spit it!

144
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,740
Spit up everything you ate immediately!

145
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,780
Wh-What are you doing, Shanks!?

146
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,380
What was that... just now?

147
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,000
What you ate was the Gomu Gomu fruit!

148
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,590
The Gomu Gomu fruit is a Devil Fruit!

149
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,420
You become a rubberman after eating it!

150
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,950
And you inherit a body that is unable to swim for the rest of your life!

151
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,030
NO WAY!!

152
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,350
YOU FREAKING IDIOT!!

153
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,370
You disturbed us while we were having fun drinking sake...

154
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,620
What's the big deal, brat?

155
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,670
Shit! Apologize!

156
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,750
How could you make fun of Shanks and the others!?

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,920
Did I say something that stayed on your mind?

158
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,680
You did! Apologize!

159
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,340
Mayor-san!

160
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Did you see the faces of those pirates from earlier!?

161
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,730
What a pathetic guy, he wouldn't let out a word of complaint after having sake spilled all over him!

162
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,800
Pirate crews are a gathering of cowards.

163
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,070
They're pitiful.

164
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,360
Stop it!

165
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,070
Don't ridicule Shanks and the others!

166
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,660
They're not cowards!

167
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,990
Please stop it, Luffy!

168
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,190
Don't take Shanks and the other for idiots!

169
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,290
You moron bandit!

170
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,340
Your choice of words was quite bad, brat.

171
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,930
No one has survived pissing me off up until now...

172
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,760
Ah, please wait!

173
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,840
Please release that kid!

174
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,770
I beg of you!

175
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,980
I have no idea of what Luffy did, and I've got no intentions of going against you.

176
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,020
If an apology won't do, we'll pay you!

177
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,110
I beg of you, please spare that boy's life...

178
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,360
Mayor!

179
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,780
As expected, elders know the ways of this world very well...

180
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,680
But it's no use, this brat won't be saved.

181
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,620
He pissed me off, you see...

182
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,920
The bad ones are you, mountain monkey!

183
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,960
What a hopeless runt...

184
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,880
Repent for your actions in the other world!

185
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,960
Luffy!

186
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,720
I beg of you, let him get away!

187
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,260
I was wondering what was happening since the bar was empty.

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,470
Ain't it the bandit from earlier?

189
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,230
Captain-san!

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,060
Shanks!

191
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,060
Pirate... You're still in this village?

192
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,060
Were you trying to clean the whole village all this time?

193
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,810
Luffy.

194
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Wasn't your punch as strong as a pistol?

195
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,270
Shut up!

196
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,990
I don't know what you came here for, but it would be better for you to run before getting hurt.

197
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,870
We'll blow your head off if you get any closer, coward.

198
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,540
He told you not to get any closer,

199
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,750
or I'll blow your head to pieces.

200
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,170
Bet your life on it.

201
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,140
If you're going to use that pistol, bet your life.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,350
What are you talking about, you bastard?

203
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,020
I told you this wasn't a kid's toy.

204
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,780
He did it!

205
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,450
What unfair jerks!

206
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,660
Unfair?

207
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,260
Stop talking naive trash.

208
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you planning to fight us after this?

209
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,710
The ones standing in front of you are pirates...

210
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,870
Shut up!

211
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,000
We don't have any business with you anyway!

212
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,340
Listen well, bandits.

213
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,180
I don't mind having drinks and food spilt all over me, nor being spit in the face...

214
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,470
I'll just laugh about it.

215
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,550
However...

216
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,520
Whatever the reason, I won't forgive anyone who hurts my friends!

217
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,100
Shanks!

218
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,190
You won't forgive me?

219
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,480
You pirate scum...

220
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,530
Guys, slaughter them!

221
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,740
I'll do it, I'll be enough.

222
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,130
Don't get too excited, bandit.

223
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,460
If you wanna measure yourself to us, at least bring a battleship.

224
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,720
So strong...

225
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,820
Wait a sec!

226
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,060
This brat started it all!

227
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,770
You've got a bounty after all...

228
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,560
SHIT!

229
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,900
A smokescreen!?

230
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,230
Luffy!

231
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,090
I escaped from right under their noses.

232
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,030
They'd never think a bandit would escape on the sea!

233
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,710
Shit!

234
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,490
Let me go, stupid mountain monkey!

235
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,410
You should just die!

236
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,790
Idiot, you're the one who's going to die.

237
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,710
You pissed me off after all...

238
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,650
Farewell.

239
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,170
Shit, shit!

240
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,340
They're nothing but scum, but I couldn't even lay a hit!

241
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,170
Shit!!

242
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,970
Sorry about that, but you're useless now.

243
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,990
W-What the hell is this!?

244
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,450
Come back!

245
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,160
Someone help me!

246
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,260
Shanks...

247
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,310
Get lost.

248
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,090
Thanks, Luffy.

249
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,630
I heard everything from Makino-san.

250
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,510
You fought for us, right?

251
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,990
Oi, don't cry!

252
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,890
You're a man, right?

253
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,390
But...

254
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Shanks!

255
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,010
Your arm!!

256
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,310
That's a cheap price, it's just an arm.

257
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,820
I'm glad you're safe.

258
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,300
You're leaving, right?

259
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,300
Yeah.

260
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,390
We docked here for a long time, but it's time to say farewell.

261
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,850
You'll miss us, right?

262
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,310
Yeah, I guess I'll miss you.

263
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,770
But I won't ask you to take me with you anymore.

264
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,760
I decided to become one by myself.

265
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,750
A pirate...

266
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
I wouldn't have taken you with me anyway!

267
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,860
As if someone like you could become a pirate!

268
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,490
I will!

269
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,570
Someday, I'll gather nakama who won't lose to this crew,

270
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,750
find the greatest treasure in the world,

271
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,950
and I'll definitely become the Pirate King!

272
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,130
Oh? You're going to surpass us?

273
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,170
Then...

274
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,750
I'll entrust this hat to you.

275
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,180
It's my precious hat.

276
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,430
Take good care of it...

277
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,720
It's been ten years since then.

278
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,350
I set out to the sea and became a pirate.

279
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,580
I'll protect my nakama just as Shanks protected me!

280
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,890
Wait for us!

281
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,940
Robin!

282
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,840
D-Don't worry, Luffy-kun!

283
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,750
I-I'm by your side!

284
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,080
Your voice is quite unstable, isn't it?

285
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,790
I-I'm shaking from excitement!

286
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,550
Okay!

287
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,550
Then let's wipe out these World Government jerks already!

288
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,630
And save Robin-kun at all costs!

289
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,220
Next time, One Piece: A Man's Way of Life!
Zoro's Techniques, Usopp's Dream.

290
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,390
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

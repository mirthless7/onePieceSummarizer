1
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,071
THE WITCH OF COCOYASHI VILLAGE!
ARLONG'S FEMALE OFFICER

2
00:01:53,071 --> 00:02:00,286
THE WITCH OF COCOYASHI VILLAGE!
ARLONG'S FEMALE OFFICER

3
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,476
What's he trying to say?

4
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,525
Let go of my hand.

5
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,863
I'm saying that it's mine!

6
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,905
What?!

7
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,407
Who decided that?

8
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,286
It's on my own plate, it's gotta be mine!

9
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,496
Oh really? Okay...

10
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,217
I wanted to save it for last!

11
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,636
Sorry, I'll give it back to you then.

12
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,347
No way! That's no longer edible!

13
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,057
I'm not some kind of dog!

14
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:04,684
Pipe down a sec.

15
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,023
Something's beneath us...

16
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,780
It's huge...

17
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,287
What's that?

18
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,586
Monster!!

19
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,297
A cow! It's humungous!

20
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,550
A cow? Swimming?

21
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,960
It's more likely a hippo.

22
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,930
But, why is that thing here in East Blue?

23
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,933
This kind of creature should
only be at the Grand Line!

24
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,979
Eh? What's it up to?

25
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,485
He's eyeing our food!

26
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,487
Please hurry and give it up to him!

27
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,114
Before he turns the ship over!

28
00:03:59,114 --> 00:03:59,572
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

29
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,116
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

30
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:01,783
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

31
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,123
Don't touch my food!

32
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,583
You did it! You're great, Luffy-aniki!

33
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,714
Ah! He's gone berserk now!

34
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,923
You want another?

35
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,049
Idiot!

36
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,136
Don't beat up hungry mortals!

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,098
Maybe he can't find anything to eat
'coz of an injury or something.

38
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,183
Isn't that so?

39
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,560
What compassion!

40
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,353
Go ahead.

41
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,647
Feel free to have it.

42
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,615
Go to hell!

43
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,579
What are you doing?

44
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,872
Where's the love!?

45
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,833
That thing was gonna feed on me as well.

46
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,297
Here it comes!

47
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,757
He's gonna turn over our ship!

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,424
Why you..!

49
00:04:59,507 --> 00:04:59,924
Hold on.

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,925
Let me take care of this.

51
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,922
COLLIER SHOOT!

52
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,354
A hippo alright.

53
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,361
Now! Let's continue with our meal!

54
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,196
That was a nice workout.

55
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,865
These guys are crazy...

56
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,586
Ah? Where am I?

57
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,545
This is my home.

58
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:38,963
Eh?

59
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,382
Awake now?

60
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,008
You're the..!

61
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,593
I'm Nojiko.

62
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,595
I plant oranges here.

63
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,138
I remember!

64
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,765
You're the one who hit me, right?

65
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,265
You're the one who hit me, right?

66
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:49,307
You're the one who hit me, right?

67
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,227
And to think that I was kind enough
to try and rescue you!

68
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,771
I was the one who did the rescuing.

69
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,570
If you were to fight that merman in your
condition, you would've gotten killed.

70
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,659
Outsiders don't know anything about
what's going on around here.

71
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,704
You're a kid of Gosa, the neighbor town, aren't you?

72
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:13,281
You should know well enough that you'd
get killed if you fought them.

73
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,874
More than well enough...

74
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,378
I know! I know, but...

75
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,297
They were the ones who killed my dad!

76
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:26,261
They robbed everything, destroyed the
village, and killed many of its people!

77
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,762
I'll never forgive them!

78
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,797
No matter what happens, I'll never forgive them!

79
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,934
So, I headed for Arlong Park,

80
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,853
but some woman of the gang blocked me off!

81
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,603
but some woman of the gang blocked me off!

82
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
but some woman of the gang blocked me off!

83
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,525
She's...

84
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,402
like some sort of witch!

85
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:42,694
like some sort of witch!

86
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,612
It was mortifying!

87
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,690
I'll have my revenge for my dad,
even if it means death!

88
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,716
Then go drop dead

89
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,954
Getting yourself killed would
make it a 'great' revenge.

90
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,873
But at least keep this in mind,

91
00:06:55,623 --> 00:07:01,713
thanks to me and the witch at Arlong Park,
your life has been spared twice.

92
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,176
Drink your tea and leave.

93
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,095
Hey! Don't you think that's too harsh for the kid?

94
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,516
Kid or not, if he really wants
to die, why not just let him?

95
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,437
He doesn't have enough will
to live in these harsh times!

96
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,064
What are you trying to say?

97
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,231
I always look to the future.

98
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,150
I know of a child who chose to live.

99
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,944
Who lives a lifestyle that is more painful than death.

100
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,784
That's why I hate people who simply want
to go off and die like this kid here!

101
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,082
What... What should I do?

102
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,377
I'll try my best to hold it in.

103
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,254
But, what should I do?

104
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:45,924
Your mother?

105
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:45,965
Your mother?

106
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,511
She's alive.

107
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,223
She must be worried.

108
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,225
Go back to your mom.

109
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,018
Okay.

110
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,701
You're a real nice gal... even though you got tattoos.

111
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,735
Stereotype.

112
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,913
Speaking of which, I still don't know who you are.

113
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,289
Oh yeah, of course...

114
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh yeah, of course...

115
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,583
My name's Captain Usopp.

116
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,169
I'm looking for a girl called Nami.

117
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,254
Nami?

118
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,464
you know her?

119
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,052
What?!

120
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:31,720
Nami's an officer of that gang?

121
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:31,970
Nami's an officer of that gang?

122
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:32,303
Nami's an officer of that gang?

123
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,179
Nami's an officer of that gang?

124
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,513
Nami's an officer of that gang?

125
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,474
Yeah, everyone knows.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,618
That kid was talking about her too.

127
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,478
The witch-like woman.

128
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,747
Here's another surprise...

129
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,666
This is the pIace where that witch was raised.

130
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,073
Me and Nami are foster sisters.

131
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,954
This is...

132
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
Nami's home...?

133
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,835
Both Nami and I were orphans.

134
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,588
We grew up here.

135
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:12,761
Though our mother who raised us has died,
the three of us used to live happily,

136
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,137
here in Cocoyashi Village...

137
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:23,563
You mean to tell me that she betrayed her
mom and friends to join Arlong's gang?

138
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,732
Yeah, that's about right.

139
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,317
Isn't she just the witch?

140
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,071
Damn, now I get it...

141
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,615
She's been deceiving us from the start!

142
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,409
She was just after our money!

143
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,579
She even joined in the battle to defend my village.

144
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,249
She even laughed as if she was
enjoying herself on the ship!

145
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,086
Enjoying herself...

146
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:48,838
her?

147
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,467
We came here to get her back,

148
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,986
but apparently it's not necessary...

149
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,435
Now that I think about it...

150
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,355
A mate of mine has been unfortunately
caught by those mermen.

151
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,318
Shit... I wonder how he's doing now..?

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,280
See? You're following me now?

153
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,659
From the beginning, I've only been using you.

154
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,078
You guys aren't too shabby at fighting.

155
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,497
You were a real useful bunch.

156
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:27,168
You were blindly deceived, weren't you?

157
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,132
She can even forget her mother's
death for the sake of money.

158
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,718
This woman's a cold-blooded witch.

159
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:40,140
You shouldn't have underestimated her.

160
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,716
I get the picture now...

161
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,604
I never did trust her from the beginning.

162
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,775
I wouldn't be surprised if she was a murderer even.

163
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,445
If you understand, just get lost already!

164
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,587
You're an eyesore!

165
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,502
Why? Why did he jump in the pool all a sudden?

166
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,464
Did anyone say a bad joke?

167
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,925
Nope, it's not like he slipped in because of one.

168
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,302
Then, he must be trying to escape!

169
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,638
No way. His arms and legs are all tied up.

170
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,183
How can he swim? I bet it's suicide.

171
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,976
Forget him.

172
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,151
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

173
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:40,200
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

174
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,542
Never imagined that he'd commit suicide.

175
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,961
He looked too good to just give up that easily.

176
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,881
Should we teach him on how to value life?

177
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,679
That idiot!

178
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,651
She's got him!

179
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,736
Hey! What are you doing, Nami?

180
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,074
What do you think you're doing?

181
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,246
Same to you, what do you think you're doing?

182
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,127
You can't even let one person die in front of you...

183
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,629
Quit the act already.

184
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,716
Help me here, idiot!

185
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,459
I thought I was a goner there.

186
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,002
Stop messing with me!

187
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,140
If you get involved with me anymore, you'll die!

188
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,308
I wonder about that...

189
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,437
Wonderful bandage you got there.

190
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,606
I can't afford new clothes. This is a substitute.

191
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,619
Hey, Nami. What are you planning for him?

192
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,414
Lock him up. I'll take care of it.

193
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,958
Arlong-san! Arlong-san!

194
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,420
What's wrong, bud?

195
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,588
Forgive me.

196
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:22,302
There was a long-nosed guy who was
with him, but I failed to capture him.

197
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,182
That damned Usopp. He got himself discovered?

198
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,227
I think he fled into Cocoyashi Village, but...

199
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,230
Cocoyashi Village?

200
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:35,690
Good timing.

201
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,692
I got some errands there.

202
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,487
Shall I pay them a visit?

203
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,538
Hey! Arlong's coming!

204
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,248
What?

205
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,042
What's going on?

206
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,294
We just paid the tributes.

207
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,132
Maybe he's coming to punish
me for weapon possession.

208
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,093
Everyone, hurry into your homes.

209
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,552
Gen-san...

210
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:06,471
Here they come!

211
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,981
Was it you?

212
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,110
The one who has the damned weapon?

213
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,112
Yes, I am.

214
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:26,908
I just love admiring my weapons.

215
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,496
Is there something wrong with one of your
subjects having a weapon collection?

216
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,998
Yeah, 'coz it'll be trouble.

217
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,377
Weapons only draw in evil and violence.

218
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,714
It's a main factor of disturbing the peace.

219
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,551
He's huge! That's Arlong?

220
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,386
He's no human alright!

221
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,513
Well, he is a merman.

222
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,264
Right.

223
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,142
I've got 20 villages and towns under my control.

224
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:54,644
Rebels are a pain in the butt.

225
00:14:55,145 --> 00:15:02,027
As ruler, I destroyed Gosa Village as a warning.

226
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:08,366
The fact that they failed to pay their tributes
was an indication of rebellion.

227
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,744
What tribute?

228
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,330
It's just like he said, it's money offered to them.

229
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,543
Every month, we have to spend
money to buy our own lives.

230
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,170
Whether it be adults or children.

231
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:25,175
If anyone can't afford to pay
it, even if there's only one,

232
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,136
their village would be wrecked like Gosa's.

233
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,223
That... town was turned over just
because of one person?

234
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,808
That's how Arlong does things.

235
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:38,438
They are racists who don't give a care about
killing and toying with human lives.

236
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:44,736
Understand? Low-life humans should just think of
nothing but ways of offering the money to me.

237
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,490
I need lots of funds.

238
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:56,289
The tribute that you offer will be the very foundation
of the Arlong Empire which will dominate East Blue!

239
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,460
Arlong Empire...?

240
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:06,174
Are they planning to dominate the whole
of East Blue as a Merman Empire?

241
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,157
Leave quickly.

242
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,076
Before Arlong gets back.

243
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,427
Gen-san!

244
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,140
It's rebellious enough by just possessing a weapon.

245
00:16:55,724 --> 00:17:00,520
In order to prevent any other
rebels from you humans,

246
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,731
I shall kill you right here, right now.

247
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,191
You gotta be kidding!

248
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,526
He only possessed the weapon!

249
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,611
Will he kill him just for that?

250
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,280
That's so selfish!

251
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,577
How can you be so selfish, Arlong?!

252
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:23,001
We've been offering tributes to you
for eight years now, without fail!

253
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,254
There's no way that we'd even think
about rebelling, is there?!

254
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,381
Let him go!

255
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,052
She's right!

256
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,596
He didn't use any weapons!

257
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:35,680
Please don't!

258
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,057
Let Gen-san go!

259
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,853
I said that possession of a weapon
is also a form of rebellion.

260
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,456
Or are your thoughts otherwise?

261
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,416
Do you want me to dig up this village?

262
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:51,988
If anyone dares to go against us, then don't
expect less than the demise of this village.

263
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,657
I don't mind whatever you choose.

264
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,744
Everyone, go back inside!

265
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,040
It'll be futile to fight them now.

266
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:08,254
If we were to resist them with our fists,
we would have done so eight years ago!

267
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,007
But, we swore to each other,

268
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,762
''Let's fight with patience. For our survival!''

269
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:17,806
Gen-san...

270
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,182
But...

271
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,435
That's so touching... nicely said.

272
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,438
Of course you can be happy for being alive...

273
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,733
Even worthless pests like you!

274
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,860
Gen-san!

275
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,449
Because not all living things were made equal!

276
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,452
You bastard!

277
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,120
No!

278
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,997
Don't fight, no matter what!

279
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,333
But, Gen-san!

280
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,213
Everything's over if you were to die.

281
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,966
Don't abandon the endurance we've gone through!

282
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,385
Even if I die...

283
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,553
Nice speech.

284
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,723
Mere humans, behold!

285
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:03,226
This person, who had the notion of rebelling
us, will now endure his fate.

286
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,437
Let this be a warning!

287
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:06,855
KAYAKUBOSHI!

288
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,901
Huh? What happened?

289
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,279
Look! Over there!

290
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,657
There's someone on the roof!

291
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,744
Who the hell are you?

292
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:27,042
I'm the brave warrior of the sea, C-Captain Usopp!

293
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:27,167
I'm the brave warrior of the sea, C-Captain Usopp!

294
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:29,753
It's him!

295
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:35,258
Thousands of people all over the world fear me,
calling me King Usopp who emerged from hell!

296
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,469
I shall have mercy on you if you escape now!

297
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,928
I am here...

298
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,807
Arlong-san! That's the guy who
I failed to capture awhile ago!

299
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,394
Thousands of people are nothing to me.

300
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,773
I'd clobber every single one of them to death!!

301
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,943
He doesn't fear me nor my Kayakuboshi!

302
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,571
Just a mere human...

303
00:19:57,307 --> 00:20:00,533
What is a low-life human like
you trying to do to me?!

304
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,042
Arlong-san! Hold on a sec!

305
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,046
With Gosa also gone, our funds will clearly deplete!

306
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:18,843
It's easy to destroy these human villages,
but our aim is domination!

307
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,346
Destroy then rebuild.

308
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,558
We are the most superior of all creatures!

309
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,602
It's our turn now?

310
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,649
What about that guy?

311
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,902
Damn, I thought I was a goner.

312
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,363
He's still alive! Get him!

313
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,034
I'll catch him and exterminate him!

314
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,203
Forget about that guy!

315
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,164
Else you're gonna ruin this place!

316
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,418
You better catch him!

317
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,878
What does he take us for?

318
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,005
We'll be back.

319
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,257
Aren't you guys fortunate?

320
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,142
Sorry, for troubling all of you.

321
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,977
What are you babbling about?

322
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,729
It's not your fault.

323
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:11,688
Right!

324
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,232
But, who was the lad just now?

325
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,486
Everyone! Long time no see...

326
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:20,530
Nami!

327
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,364
Na-chan!

328
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:30,957
What's the matter?

329
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,793
It's rare for you to use the main road.

330
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,837
I heard a big noise.

331
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,747
It was Arlong, wasn't it?

332
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,286
Another 7 million beli more...

333
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:55,190
As usual, your reputation's pretty bad.

334
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,984
No surprise, I am a pirate after all.

335
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,820
But Arlong understands me.

336
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,114
Anything can be solved with money.

337
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,659
Just a little more to keep my part of the bargain...

338
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:14,501
No matter what, I just have to get 100 million beli and I can buy the village!

339
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:24,302
She told me to escape, but the only thing I have to do lies here.

340
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,223
I did promise Luffy that I'd get her back, didn't I?

341
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,393
Now then, what should I do?

342
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,520
Things are getting complicated.

343
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,483
Yahoo!

344
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,026
We've got speed now!

345
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:44,781
Luffy-aniki! Arlong Park is sighted!

346
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:47,659
Here we come! Arlong Park!

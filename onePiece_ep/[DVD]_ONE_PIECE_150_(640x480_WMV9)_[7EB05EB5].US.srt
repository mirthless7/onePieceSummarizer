1
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,050
Gold bells and birds.

2
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,300
Ca was to be them
symbols of Jaya formerly.

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,200
No idea…

4
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,260
I wonder whether it is not only one
part of a larger unit.

5
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,310
It is a Bird of the South…

6
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,290
and he lives precisely here, on this island.

7
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,510
And is its cry odd?

8
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,390
Ouais, like writing in the newspaper.

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,330
In old times, one was useful oneself
birds of the South aboard ships for…

10
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,030
GOOD BLOOD!!

11
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,890
What!? What there is?!

12
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,090
It is necessary to capture one of
these birds! Immediately!

13
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,510
Hein? Does it like?

14
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,910
This sparrow? But why?

15
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,610
Listen to me well.

16
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,120
Tomorrow you will face
Knock-Up Stream!

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,540
You will have to go full South.

18
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,150
But how you count
you to return there?!

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,190
Once at sea, it will be to you
impossible to locate you!

20
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,240
I see…

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,730
It is true that our objective is not
not an island but a point on the open sea.

22
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,000
No compass will be able to help us.

23
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,260
You will need
assets of this bird.

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,470
I had wind of the tragedy
history of Montblanc to the tavern.

25
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,440
I had of it the tears with the eyes, Cricket.

26
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,670
I find the fruits
labor of the others…

27
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,890
… particularly with my taste.

28
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,760
You know how one calls me?

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,230
The Hyena!

30
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:20,720
The dreams are never carried out?!
Bellamy VS Saruyama Allied Forces

31
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,600
HERE THEY ARE! DODGE!

32
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,490
They are damaged these
mantes religious!

33
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,640
AHH!! The SCOOP!

34
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,740
It IS WHAT THIS DRILL OF SHINGLE?!

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,260
It is him!

36
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,150
What him?!

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,250
It would be said that the Bird of
South controls the insects!

38
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,190
The sparrow? Small beasts?!

39
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,530
I hear it.

40
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,690
Does Ca come from where?

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,730
What?

42
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,080
I hear another noise.

43
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,880
Up there!

44
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,810
It is what that? Rocks?

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,200
They déboulent right on us!

46
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,070
They are not droppings of dung-beetles?!

47
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,070
Not.

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,780
They are insects!

49
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,340
LADYBIRDS!

50
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,230
They are enormous! IEA!

51
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,480
Ca does not finish any!

52
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,900
You do not have any enough of you
bring back, band of stupid locusts?!

53
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,120
Go, release from my way!

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,840
You believe yourselves of size?! Hein?!

55
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,640
It is heard, but it is not seen.

56
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,120
A slug!

57
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,270
Balance to him salt! Salt!

58
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,190
Sanji! Puts to him a jumped kick!

59
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,880
Ok…

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,370
HOW IF It WERE POSSIBLE!

61
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,610
Dissatisfaction
to run!

62
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,070
Let explode them to me!

63
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,240
Not, Luffy!

64
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,460
These bumblebees are poisonous!

65
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,270
Fireflies!

66
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,200
It is pretty!

67
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,510
AHH! COCKROACHES!

68
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,220
PIGS!

69
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,230
If it is the brawl which
you seek, you will have it!

70
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,130
Do not underestimate them
Allied forces Saruyama!

71
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,460
Kill them!

72
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,510
Give us gold!

73
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,660
And perhaps that one will save to you!

74
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,070
Afflicted to disappoint you…

75
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,120
V-old man…

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,840
saru lunge!

77
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,230
The children would not have
to play with this kind of instruments.

78

not done a little exercise of night.

84
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,770
Ok, now transfer to me this waste!

85
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,670
And how that jumps!

86
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,530
It is too for
Allied forces Saruyama.

87
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,310
Anything else that an old man
and a pair of enormous monkeys!

88
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,580
It was found, Bellamy!

89
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,260
Ca must be that!

90
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,640
Look at to me that!

91
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,250
Ca it is beautiful gold!

92
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,810
And there is still!

93
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,110
It is brilliant!

94
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,230
What a lucky find!

95
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,430
You do not have the right of
to touch with this gold, dirty punks!

96
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,630
Right?

97
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,910
I will show you
what a are our rights!

rights to fly of the treasures?

did not can anything make!

to repair your boat…!

170
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,860

in made not for that!

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,330
What that wants to say?!

183
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,440
Owner, you last ace ten years of your life to ruin you
health while plunging each day for this gold!

184
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,880
And now, you…

185
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,670
Close it, kid!

186
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,090
It is not serious.

187
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,530
It is our problem.

188
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,820
Measuring rod?

189
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,510
Us, members of Alliance
Saruyama, let us have obligations.

190
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,810
Your boat is not in state
to sail for the moment!

191
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,160
We must repair it
before the lever du jour!

192
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,750
We will not block your voyage!

193
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,310
Listen, I promises you
to send on the celestial island!

194
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,130
Owner…

195
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,000
He, Luffy!

196
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,650
The emblem of Bellamy…

197
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,080
A knack?

198
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,930
Not, that will go.

199
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,620
Luffy, not! Do not try anything stupid!

200
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,400
There remain to us only three
hours before raising the veils!

201
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,630
If I go along the coast,

202
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,660
I would arrive at the city
from this afternoon?

203
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,290
Yes, completely.

204
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,950
He, kid!

205
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,130
Where you go?!

206
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,960
You would not owe you
to interfere our business!

207
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,800
Do you know with whom you…

208
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,100
If you want to stop it, take that!

209
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,280
G-kid…

210
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,820
I would be of return
before the lever du jour.

211
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,560
Ah, it left…

212
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,730
I will feel one
little dehydrated after that.

213
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,690
Good Ben, one would say that it
no more only one drop has there!

214
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,890
Not, indeed.

215
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,030
O God of Drink,
thank you once again!

216
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,770
I do not believe that there exists, but good.

217
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,030
Oh, the newspaper!

218
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,940
Let us see seeing…

219
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,030
I of mande which are them
bad news, today.

220
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,490
Hein? Am misled to me.

221
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,450
It is right research opinions.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,730
Whore, this city
is really nut!

223
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,040
I have my snap of it of
all this rabble!

224
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,070
They are dirty the pétochards
from this afternoon!

225
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,730
They did us well marrer
with their history of celestial island!

226
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,260
It should not be worth more than 30 Million.

227
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,860
Hou there there! I believe
that I picolé a little too much!

228
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,790
Let us see that…

229
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,530
1…

230
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,330
10…

231
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,040
100…

232
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:05,530
1000…

233
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,510
10.000…

234
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,530
100.000…

235
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,510
1.000.000…

236
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,090
10.000.000…

237
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,980
My God! I drank really too much!

238
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,530
1…

239
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,460
10…

240
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,090
100…

241
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,900
1000…

242
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,910
10.000…

243
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,940
100.000…

244
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,940
1.000.000…

245
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,560
10.000.000…

246
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,130
100.000.000!

247
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,720
Three hours, Luffy!

248
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,240
If you did not return before…

249
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,970
we will lose our only chance to go
on the celestial island and it will be your fault!

250
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:53,120
It has to plunge the every day without leaving it
time with the bubbles to dissolve in its organization.

251
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,680
It is right a duel with
that which ruined my life.

252
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,530
Afflicted…

253
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,460
I am really sorry…

254
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,840
We were there, but us
did not can anything make!

255
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,430
WHAT A DUMB!

256
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,410
They were too funny these
two macaques, I swear you!

257
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,530
Especially the mouth in blood
and completely exploded!

258
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,550
Pleurnichant snot with the noses!

259
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,330
“Patroooon!”

260
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,760
If it is so important in your eyes,
z' have that with protecting best!

261
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,530
Not true?

262
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,410
What a loose!

263
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,040
Would not be too hard with them!

264
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,520
Vis-a-vis Bellamy, anybody
the least chance would have.

265
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,110
After all, the head of our Captain
is put at price to 55 Million Berrys.

266
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,620
CA FEARS!

267
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,400
That there of so important is
at this hour of the night?

268
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,510
This afternoon…

269
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,830
these guys who were with the bar…

270
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,390
Bellamy!

271
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,260
Be to you still there?!

272
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,110
Than you are better
cars from here immediately!

273
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,030
Be to you…

274
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,710
Be to you in danger of death!

275
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,420
What do you tell?

276
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,220
In danger? Me?

277
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,430
100 Million…

278
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,240
60 Million…

279
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,410
Exact! Guys of this afternoon…

280
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,440
They have both a premium
higher than holds, Bellamy!

281
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
You will be made kill!

282
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,790
You pleasant! One has
interest to slip by from here!

283
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,070
One is foutu
mouth of this hard to cook!

284
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,840
Perhaps that it
do not point out us!

285
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,740
One cannot remain there!

286
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,570
It is the first time that I see
somebody with a premium of 100 Million!

287
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,840
Ho, Ho, Ho, Ho!

288
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,130
Bandage morons!

289
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,820
You flippez in front
two bits of paper…

290
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,770
You do not have the eyes in
face of the holes, or what?!

291
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,230
You saw their chief, not?

292
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,070
I am there.

293
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,460
You ever heard
to speak about this kind of pirates?

294
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,510
Guys who make their characteristic
faked research opinion.

295
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,230
Pirates who bluffent
to become famous.

296
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,030
Only one glance on their posters
is enough to make fade their enemies.

297
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,190
With final, they have the fun so much
to fight that they deflate.

298
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,930
They lose before even to have fought.

299
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,090
Exactly like you maintaining!

300
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,880
You saw what it
was worth your own eyes!

301
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,530
You made pity!

302
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,910
It is true!

303
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,130
Jitter that it us
has foutu, this dumb!

304
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,810
As always, Bellamy rightly.

305
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,870
Is really necessary to have made the worst atrocities
to deserve a premium of 100 Million…

306
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,500
It is strange which one does not have it
ever seen in the newspapers!

307
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Ouais!

308
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,260
I ever intended to speak
of this “Straw hat”!

309
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,090
Oh, I see!

310
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,500
It made me well go!

311
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,330
Go! Still a toast!

312
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,830
Kanpai!

313
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,830
[Note:Kanpai! = Health!]

314
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,500
BELLAMY!

315
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,190
OR YOU HIDE?!

316
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,580
I heard my name.

317
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,750
He!

318
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,810
One precisely spoke about you.

319
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,350
You want something?

320
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,020
Ouais!

321
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,090
The gold returns which you stole
in Papi Head of Diamond!

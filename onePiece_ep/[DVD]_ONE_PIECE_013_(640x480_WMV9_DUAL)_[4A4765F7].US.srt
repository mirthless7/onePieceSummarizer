1
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:56,315
Speaking of anniversaries, tomorrow
will certainly be a day to remember.

2
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:04,781
I can't let them get to the village!

3
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:04,865
I can't let them get to the village!

4
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:04,948
I can't let them get to the village!

5
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:05,032
I can't let them get to the village!

6
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:05,282
I can't let them get to the village!

7
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:05,365
I can't let them get to the village!

8
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:05,449
I can't let them get to the village!

9
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:05,490
I can't let them get to the village!

10
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:05,532
I can't let them get to the village!

11
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:05,616
I can't let them get to the village!

12
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:05,699
I can't let them get to the village!

13
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:05,949
I can't let them get to the village!

14
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:06,033
I can't let them get to the village!

15
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:06,116
I can't let them get to the village!

16
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:06,200
I can't let them get to the village!

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,283
I can't let them get to the village!

18
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:06,366
I can't let them get to the village!

00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:06,533
I can't let them get to the village!

20
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:06,575
I can't let them get to the village!

21
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:06,700
I can't let them get to the village!

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:06,783
I can't let them get to the village!

23
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:06,867
Head straight north...

24
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:06,950
Head straight north...

25
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,534
Head straight north...

26
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:07,618
Head straight north...

27
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:07,784
Head straight north...

28
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,035
Head straight north!

29
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:08,368
Head straight north!

30
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:08,535
Head straight north!

31
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:08,744
Head straight north!

32
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:08,911
Head straight north!

33
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:08,994
Head straight north!

34
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:09,203
Head straight north!

35
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:10,204
Whoever dares to lay a hand on
my treasures is... Unforgivable!

36
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:11,622
Whoever dares to lay a hand on
my treasures is... Unforgivable!

37
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:11,788
Whoever dares to lay a hand on
my treasures is... Unforgivable!

38
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:12,873
Whoever dares to lay a hand on
my treasures is... Unforgivable!

39
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:12,956
Whoever dares to lay a hand on
my treasures is... Unforgivable!

40
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:14,482
Damn!

41
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,336
I can't get past this...

42
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:17,377
I can't get past this...

43
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:17,461
I can't get past this...

44
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:17,502
I can't get past this...

45
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:22,382
You're a hindrance!

46
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:22,549
You're a hindrance!

47
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:23,717
You're a hindrance!

48
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:23,759
You're a hindrance!

49
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:23,842
You're a hindrance!

50
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:27,262
I can't allow you.

51
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:29,264
to go beyond this slope...

52
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:29,306
to go beyond this slope...

53
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:29,932
Because I'd like to keep lying as
I've always done in the past.

54
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:33,769
Because I'd like to keep lying as
I've always done in the past.

55
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:38,106
This village will enjoy another day
of peace like any other day!

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,692
That's why I can't allow let you pass!

57
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:45,182
They're late.

58
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,782
Those bastards...

59
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:51,828
They should clearly understand what'd happen
if my plan were to be disrupted.

60
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:52,704
They should clearly understand what'd happen
if my plan were to be disrupted.

61
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:56,375
I will kill them all!

62
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:23,175
THE TERRIFYING DUO!
NYABAN BROTHER VS ZORO

63
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:37,833
They're finally here

64
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:47,384
You guys are that strong?

65
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,347
You guys are way too slow!

66
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,348
You guys are way too slow!

67
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:57,311
It's all thanks to you, dragging
me down that oil slick!

68
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:00,147
That was an accident.
There was nothing I could do about it.

69
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,318
Rather than both of us slipping, it's better
to have one of us make it through.

70
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,069
Then why not you?

71
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:06,570
Then why not you?

72
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:12,576
Go north, don't go north... you never
even told me which way was north!

73
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,747
What?! You're the one who
ran off, full of confidence!

74
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,250
That happened unconsciously... out of whim.

75
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:20,542
The sky's been bright for a while now.

76
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:20,626
The sky's been bright for a while now.

77
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:20,709
The sky's been bright for a while now.

78
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,043
The sky's been bright for a while now.

79
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:21,376
The sky's been bright for a while now.

80
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,502
The sky's been bright for a while now.

81
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:26,048
Captain Kuro is a very impatient man.

82
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:33,430
Comrades! Don't tell that you're going
to allow mere kids to defeat you?

83
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,472
Comrades! Don't tell that you're going
to alIow mere kids to defeat you?

84
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:41,396
Listen, we don't have the time to fool around here.

85
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,189
Listen, we don't have the time to fool around here.

86
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,689
Listen, we don't have the time to fool around here.

87
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:46,526
They're strong, so we'll just have to be stronger.

88
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:46,777
They're strong, so we'll just have to be stronger.

89
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,279
Now, stare into this ring.

90
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,407
With ''One, Two, Jango!'', you'll become strong.

91
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:52,616
With ''One, Two, Jango!'', you'll become strong.

92
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:56,954
Your injuries will heal and you'll become
very very very very strong!

93
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,748
What's he up to?

94
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,583
Hypnosis.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,128
Making them believe that they're
strong... that's just stupid!

96
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:07,130
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

97
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,297
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

98
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:07,339
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

99
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:07,381
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

100
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:07,422
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

101
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:07,506
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

102
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:07,631
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

103
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:07,673
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

104
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:07,714
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

105
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:07,756
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

106
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:07,923
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

107
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:08,298
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

108
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:08,340
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,840
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

110
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,216
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

111
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:09,550
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

112
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,591
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

113
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:09,675
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

114
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:09,716
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

115
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:09,800
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:09,841
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

117
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:10,092
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

118
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:10,300
You'll become stronger... much stronger!

119
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:14,555
One...

120
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,265
Two...

121
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,141
Jango!

122
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:23,605
No way!

123
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,204
Th... the cliff's totalIy destroyed!

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,122
What power!

125
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,582
What power!

126
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,459
They're reaIly hypnotized.

127
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:44,918
They're really hypnotized.

128
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,127
They're really hypnotized.

129
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,169
That's just one of 'em, and there're so many!

130
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,171
That's just one of 'em, and there're so many!

131
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,050
Go!

132
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:52,342
Break the necks of anyone that tries to stop us!

133
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:52,676
Break the necks of anyone that tries to stop us!

134
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:52,843
Break the necks of anyone that tries to stop us!

135
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:54,595
Break the necks of anyone that tries to stop us!

136
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,774
You two get out of the way!

137
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,569
We'lI take it from here!

138
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:15,198
Hey Luffy!

139
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:20,370
Luffy?

140
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,961
You're hypnotized too?!

141
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:28,045
You're hypnotized too?!

142
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:28,295
You're hypnotized too?!

143
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:38,138
What a simpleton!

144
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,359
GOMU GOMU NO...

145
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:49,254
MACHINE GUN!!!

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,079
Captain Kuro made a big miscalculation.

147
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,374
They're not your ordinary brats.

148
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,895
Where's he going?

149
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:37,614
What's he doing?

150
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:37,948
What's he doing?

151
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,127
Go! Luffy!

152
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,214
He's destroying the ship!

153
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,809
No!

154
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:09,313
He wants to whack us with it!

155
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,233
Hurry up and think of something, Capt'!

156
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:16,653
Crap, this is no time to just watch.

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,326
With ''One, Two, Jango!'', you will fall asleep.

158
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:22,743
With ''One, Two, Jango!'', you will fall asleep.

159
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:25,787
One...

160
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,289
Two...

161
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:28,665
Jango!

162
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:03,158
What?! That caretaker, Kurahadol,
headed for the coast?

163
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,453
He looked very scary.

164
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,413
Is Kaya-san alright?

165
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,167
Yosh! The Usopp Pirate Gang are off!

166
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,419
Hey, don't sleep!

167
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,759
But it's still sleeping time.

168
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,803
This is not the time to sleep!

169
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,305
There might be something horrible happening.

170
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:25,347
There might be something horrible happening.

171
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,311
I still think that the pirates are going to attack.

172
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,274
Although Captain said that he was
lying, I don't really think he was.

173
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,192
I think so too.

174
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,944
Me too.

175
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,572
Captain was acting really weird yesterday.

176
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:41,947
Captain was acting really weird yesterday.

177
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,500
You don't think..?

178
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:03,677
I remember that Captain always
come through this way.

179
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,080
No use, it's sealed off.

180
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,265
Let's find another way in!

181
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:08,390
Let's find another way in!

182
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:23,488
You!

183
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:26,909
Dare to make fun of me?!

184
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,203
Just because pirate's blood flows within me...

185
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,413
You look down upon me!

186
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,457
Please stop, Usopp-san!

187
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:02,611
Kurahadol...

188
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,365
Kurahadol, are you there?

189
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,620
Kurahadol?

190
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:16,583
Meri!

191
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:18,377
Meri!

192
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,337
What's wrong?

193
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:21,255
What happened?

194
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,298
Hey, wake up, Meri!

195
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,218
Don't die on me!

196
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,844
Ojousama...

197
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:30,222
Thank goodness you're alright.

198
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:31,932
Meri...

199
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,480
Meri, who did this to you?!

200
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,357
Kurahadol...

201
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,110
He... did this to me.

202
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:49,741
His... His true identity is a pirate!

203
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,120
What are you talking about?

204
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,915
He became interested with the family fortune.

205
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,209
That's why he got close to you.

206
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:02,546
That's... that's just ridicu...

207
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,547
It's the truth!

208
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,225
Then...

209
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,812
What Usopp-san said yesterday was...

210
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:25,652
Come to think of it, he was the only
one who knew of the truth.

211
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:28,780
He risked his life trying to save us.

212
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:34,929
But none of us would believe a word he said...

213
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,122
Get out of here, Kaya!

214
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:37,164
Get out of here, Kaya!

215
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:38,040
Get out of here, Kaya!

216
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:39,499
Or you'll be killed!

217
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:39,708
Or you'll be killed!

218
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:41,585
In any case, let's get out of here for now!

219
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,170
In any case, let's get out of here for nowI

220
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,087
In any case, let's get out of here for now!

221
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:48,675
We only thought of protecting the bad guy...

222
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:50,761
And made that brave young man...

223
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:55,849
The man who wanted to protect the village...
the man who risked his life to warn us...

224
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,061
We chased him out of the village!

225
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,400
Anyone! Is anyone here?! Anyone!

226
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,026
Ojousama...
Anyone! Is anyone here?! Anyone!

227
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:07,694
Ojousama... it's useless.

228
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:15,494
Everyone's gone on vacation since yesterday.

229
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,371
That can't be...

230
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:19,039
Then I...

231
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,206
Then I...

232
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,749
Now's not the time to panic!

233
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,169
Nothing's happened yet.

234
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:28,632
It's vital that you calm down and
think of a solution for all this.

235
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:35,430
If Kurahadol's motive is just to
own everything in this house,

236
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,141
then just give it to him!

237
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,187
It's not worth your life to protect it.

238
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:46,650
Yes.

239
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,861
The problem at hand now is that you're
the only one who can stop Kurahadol.

240
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,573
The problem at hand now is that you're
the only one who can stop Kurahadol.

241
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:56,076
Can you do it?

242
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,872
Even though this is not your responsibility.

243
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,459
I understand.

244
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:08,046
I... will not run away from this.

245
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,465
I understand the consequences.

246
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,596
I will talk to Kurahadol!

247
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:21,159
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

248
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:28,166
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

249
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,768
What do you think you're doing?

250
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,604
Hold on to them tight!

251
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,565
But these iron bars are too slippery!

252
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:43,898
But these iron bars are too slippery!

253
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,525
We still need to climb over, even if it is.

254
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,195
Aren't you worried about Kaya-san?

255
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:51,865
Someone's coming.

256
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:52,699
Hide!

257
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:57,579
It's Kaya-san!

258
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:58,872
She's okay!

259
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:14,012
She seems to be troubled by something.

260
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,182
Kaya-san is leaving her house alone.

261
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:18,516
Somethings up.

262
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,186
Something must've happened!

263
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,121
Seems like they got wiped out.

264
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:40,914
Looks like it.

265
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:45,585
Hey, we should be more concerned
of Luffy being under that thing.

266
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,420
He's not gonna die.

267
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,548
You'd better worry more about your own injuries.

268
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:55,762
That brat really screwed us over.

269
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,264
Now the plan's all messed up!

270
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:03,144
If Captain Kuro sees this, we'll all be killed!

271
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,064
Hey, hey.. Buchi!

272
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,108
Look what happened out here!

273
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,110
What's all this?

274
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:12,779
We still have our trump card.

275
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:16,032
Come out! Nyaban Brothers!

276
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,957
You called, Captain Jango?

277
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:26,876
You called?

278
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,586
Sham and...

279
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:29,421
Buchi!

280
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,425
Together, we're the Nyaban Brothers!

281
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:38,138
Buchi, Sham..

282
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:42,475
We must get passed this slope, but...

283
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,644
As you can see, someone's in our way.

284
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:45,937
Take care of him.

285
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:52,277
Th... that's impossible for us!

286
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:53,820
Right, Buchi?

287
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:56,489
Yeah, he seems to be very strong.

288
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:01,745
Moreover, our responsibility's
just to look after the ship.

289
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,206
Ah yeah, you're right. We're
not responsible for battles.

290
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,878
What's this? Aren't they supposed
to be their trump card?

291
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:13,256
Sham, just go do it!

292
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,008
Eh?! M-me?!

293
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:16,092
Get goin'!!

294
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,845
Fi... fine... I'm going.

295
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,764
He looks completely different.

296
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,223
What're they up to?

297
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,936
How can he possibly fight like that?

298
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:31,358
Hey you! Be prepared, cause I'm gonna
to tear you apart with these very claws!

299
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,737
What am I supposed to do with this guy?

300
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:38,365
You! If you don't stop, I'll kill you!

301
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,785
That is if you can kill me.

302
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:42,494
What?!

303
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,624
This bastard...

304
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,708
You...

305
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:51,503
Took me too lightly.

306
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,421
You blocked it well.

307
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:56,508
I was acting so well too.

308
00:17:57,384 --> 00:18:02,806
I may be tiny, but you'd better not take
Sham of the Nyaban Brothers lightly.

309
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,812
Lose something?

310
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:11,064
I wouldn't know anything about it.

311
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:13,108
There it is...

312
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:14,317
Cat snatch.

313
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,820
Return those katanas to me!

314
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:18,113
Return it?

315
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,991
Isn't your katana in your hand?

316
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,663
These will only get in the way.

317
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:36,715
Now... I feel much lighter.

318
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:40,385
How dare you throw my precious belongings!

319
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,016
Bastard!

320
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,269
What?

321
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:52,147
What were you trying to cut?

322
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,024
I'm a cat after all.

323
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,696
Come Buchi! Your turn!

324
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,156
Gotcha, Sham!

325
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:01,615
Gotcha, Sham!

326
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,491
Watch this!

327
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:04,159
Watch this!

328
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:04,576
Watch this!

329
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,663
Got him!

330
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,002
Damn! He got away.

331
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,713
Hey, hold him down properly Sham!

332
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:20,884
Sorry, my bad. I didn't expect him
to have such brute strength.

333
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,678
You gotta be kidding me.

334
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:28,224
If he had actuallt hit me with that, all my bones would've shattered to pieces.

335
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,977
He won't get away this time!

336
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:32,103
Of course not!

337
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,607
I'm not too familiar with one sword techniques, but...

338
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,487
Let's go, Buchi!

339
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,530
Gotcha, Sham!

340
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,700
Cat Claws Attack!

341
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:58,505
This is bad, Zoro's under heavy pressure.

342
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,717
What're you trying to do?

343
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:06,763
If they keep attacking him like that,
there's no way he can win.

344
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,098
I'm covering him!

345
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,724
Go..

346
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:10,976
NAMAIIBOSHI!

347
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:11,142
NAMAIIBOSHI!

348
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:11,309
NAMAIIBOSHI!

349
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,067
An opening!

350
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:27,367
Why are you hitting our own people!

351
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,744
That's not what happened.

352
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:33,206
He's the one who moved to get hit.

353
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:34,958
Eh?! He did it himself?

354
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:39,087
You moron! Usopp!

355
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:40,630
You wanna die?

356
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:46,219
Maybe...

357
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:49,264
We're the ones who were saved.

358
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:53,268
If you had hit them with the pachinko,
then those two would've probabIy...

359
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,771
Directed their attacks toward us instead.

360
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:58,481
That guy...

361
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,318
This is no time to be worried about us!

362
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,947
Damn.

363
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:08,742
If only I had one more katana.

364
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:15,540
I'm going to fetch his katanas.

365
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:17,834
If Zoro gets his katanas back, then he can defeat them!

366
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,085
Then I should...

367
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:21,421
Don't push yourself.

368
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:23,381
You can't even stand up straight.

369
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:26,051
Hey Nami!

370
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:47,155
Nami!

371
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,532
What do you want with these katanas?

372
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,969
There's a good reason for this...

373
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,685
The sky's been bright for a long while.

374
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:21,231
Why didn't you act according to plan?

375
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,484
Ca... captain Kuro!

376
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:26,111
We're gonna be killed!

377
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:27,988
What?

378
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:33,868
This is bad.

379
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,928
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?!!

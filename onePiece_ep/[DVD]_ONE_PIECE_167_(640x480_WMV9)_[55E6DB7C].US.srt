1
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,419
Laki!

2
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,588
What are you doing?

3
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:04,967
You're going to die if you just hang there.

4
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:09,596
Is this stuff worth dying over?

5
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,360
Kamakiri!

6
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:32,661
Yeah, I was just going to bring this wood over to the ship so i can repair it tomorrow.

7
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:34,121
And were you planning to swim across?

8
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,250
Those huge sharks are still lurking in there.

9
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:42,629
Look at this.

10
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,466
This is the topography of Jaya, 400 years ago.

11
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:47,424
Wow, a skull!

12
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,510
Wow, a skull!

13
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,845
It looks like a skull!

14
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,264
Well?

15
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,141
Kamakiri...

16
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,601
What about your injuries...?

17
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:56,977
I can still fight!

18
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,397
I can still fight!

19
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:05,819
You're right. If there's any time to take out Upper Yard, it's now.

20
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:13,077
In today's battle, the effects of Satori's absence were clear.

21
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:17,289
Tomorrow morning, we must attack again, Wiper!

22
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:25,464
GOD ENEL APPEARS!!
AUBADE TO THE SURVIVORS

23
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,634
C'mon, Zoro, please.

24
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:29,635
Just for a little bit...

25
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,595
Why do I have to go with you?

26
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:33,263
How old are you?

27
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,288
If you're scared, just hold it 'til morning.

28
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:38,488
Yeah but i really have to go,
but i dont want to die...

29
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,888
That's what im thinking...

30
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,692
Oh, you're so cold, Zoro!

31
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:49,905
Idiot...

32
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,365
Idiot...

33
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:02,084
Aw, jeez...

34
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:08,841
What's that sound?

35
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,990
There shouldn't be anyone on the ship...

36
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:37,160
The mist's so thick I can't see...

37
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:26,626
Gh-Gh-Gho...

38
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,089
What's with him?

39
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:34,801
He said he was gonna take a piss, and now he's sleeping out here?

40
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,386
He's hopeless.

41
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:39,264
Gh-Gho...

42
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:40,724
Gh-Ghos...

43
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,310
Quit dreaming!

44
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,146
Gh-Gho-Ghost!

45
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:50,984
Gho...st!

46
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:54,988
We...

47
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:08,126
It must be to talk...

48
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,088
...with your bottom lip inside your mouth!

49
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,802
How careless...

50
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,388
Didn't i tell you?

51
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:23,391
Enel-sama summoned us here...

52
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,103
...because you let Wiper escape!

53
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:30,398
It's nothing to panic about.

54
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:34,694
No Shandian will escape from me again.

55
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,405
That is their fate!

56
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:37,739
Heh, that's nothing but a lame excuse!

57
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:40,784
Heh, that's nothing but a lame excuse!

58
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:44,204
If only Enel-sama...

59
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,415
...had left all of the duties to me,

60
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:55,173
We would have been victorious this very day!

61
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:57,634
Gedatsu.

62
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:01,346
An idiot like you could never do that.

63
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,014
WHAT!?

64
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,879
Let me warn you two.

65
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,147
Otherwise you will lose control of your Mantra...

66
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:13,733
....and repeat Satori's faillure.

67
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,212
You're the one who needs to learn humility, Ohm!

68
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,414
Defeating Gan Fall is nothing to get cocky about, Shura!

69
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:29,040
This looks like fun!

70
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,592
God, the Priests have arrived.

71
00:07:39,465 --> 00:07:41,428
Open the door.

72
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,190
Not again.

73
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,152
What are you doing?

74
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,238
You are absolutely disgraceful.

75
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:01,823
Shut up!

76
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,243
With these two fools in my way...

77
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,537
...i'm never able to unleash my full power!

78
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:13,710
If i was allowed to guard the island by myself,

79
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,961
I could work much better!

80
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,757
You talk pretty big!

81
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:24,304
I should teach you a lesson about the limits of your full power!

82
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,561
With the Truth of Sorrow...

83
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,813
The Ordeal of Iron!

84
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:39,069
A bore! Your Ordeal means nothing!

85
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:44,616
My Swamp presents the greatest Ordeal!

86
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,701
Would you like to try it?

87
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,578
Gedatsu-sama.

88
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,955
If you persist in doing that, you will tire yourself.

89
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:54,542
Please cross your arms and place your hands on your elbows.

90
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,169
How careless!

91
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,130
Enough!

92
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:01,800
God is before you!

93
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,134
Before us?

94
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,805
Then where exactly is He?

95
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,517
Didn't He summon us here!?

96
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:13,269
Just where is Enel-sama...!?

97
00:09:18,272 --> 00:09:19,692
Caught you by surprise!

98
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:39,129
I am God.
(''ware ga kaminari'' - ''I am lightning'')

99
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:39,170
(''ware ga kaminari'' - ''I am lightning'')

100
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,420
(''ware ga kaminari'' - ''I am lightning'')

101
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,197
I'm right here.
(''ware ga kaminari'' - ''I am lightning'')

102
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:42,340
(''ware ga kaminari'' - ''I am lightning'')

103
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,678
You need more training.

104
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,056
I do not desire any failures akin to which befell Satori.

105
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:52,559
What was that for?

106
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:54,477
Indeed.

107
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:55,945
Making light sport of us...

108
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:59,524
Is that why were summoned here?

109
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:01,901
I was bored.

110
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:04,737
But sit down.

111
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:10,577
You three do not seem preoccupied by the Blue Sea dwellers.

112
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:13,496
Enel-sama, if this is about Satori...

113
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:16,249
He was still inexperienced.

114
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,126
With that absurd Ordeal of Balls.

115
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:22,881
And that is why i call you pitiful, Shura.

116
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,968
Gan Fall is alive.

117
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,386
Impossible!

118
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:30,680
I finished off Gan Fall myself!

119
00:10:31,554 --> 00:10:34,475
He has yet to fully recover.

120
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:40,189
He and the Blue Sea dwellers seem to be along quite well.

121
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,983
A tenacious old man indeed.

122
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:47,196
But what do those Blue Sea dwellers want?

123
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:52,285
What they want...

124
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,661
...is Gold.

125
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,330
Gold?

126
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:58,583
How did they learn of that?

127
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:06,466
This island used to reside on the Blue Sea.

128
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:11,971
Of course, they will move tomorrow.

129
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,057
And the Shandians will renew their attack.

130
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:22,857
Here on Upper Yard, you each have your own area to govern,

131
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:26,110
Tomorrow, I will open all the land to you.

132
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:30,031
You may work your Ordeals anywhere you please.

133
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:33,910
And disregarding the rule, you may conduct yourseleves in as violent a manner as you see fit.

134
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,980
Why grant us so much power so suddenly?

135
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,650
Because it's already been completed...

136
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,670
The Maxim, that is.

137
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,722
It's about time we finish off this island and set out on our journey...

138
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:50,593
To the World of Dreams.

139
00:11:50,593 --> 00:12:05,066
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

140
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:13,074
To think that these children could defeat Satori...

141
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:16,828
That will make Enel their enemy.

142
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,834
And Shandia will not let this chance pass by.

143
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:26,212
Enel...

144
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,590
What is it that you want?

145
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,983
The effects were indeed clear.

146
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:51,654
Today, we will invade God's Shrine!

147
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,997
And then, Enel...

148
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:09,338
Look! It's just like i said!

149
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:10,923
Someone must have been here!

150
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:21,934
The Going Merry's...

151
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,436
...been repaired!

152
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,693
I saw it!

153
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:33,946
I knew it wasn't a dream!

154
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,950
You're right.

155
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:42,079
Even the broken mast's been repaired!

156
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:44,665
Indeed.

157
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:49,795
It must have been quite a chore simply standing up something this heavy.

158
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,090
But, I'm sorry to say...

159
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:55,801
He did a piss-poor job of it.

160
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,678
There's a nice guy out there!

161
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,223
There was someone here.

162
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,308
I saw him!

163
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:07,980
But, who would come all the way out here to fix our ship?

164
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:13,778
The only ones on Upper yard are us and our enemies.

165
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,116
But, he took off the Flying Model, Usopp.

166
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,162
Yeah.

167
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,997
That's what's even stranger about it.

168
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,588
Hey, how did the guy fixed it...

169
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:36,217
...know what Merry was supposed to look like?

170
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:39,720
He knew she didn't have a comb, or wings, or tail.

171
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:43,641
Who did you see, Usopp?

172
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:46,894
It was a dream. There's nothing else it could have been.

173
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:49,480
Oi, hey!

174
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:52,358
What are you guys goofing off for?

175
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,487
There's a lot to do.

176
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,282
Doesn't it bother you, Nami?

177
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:01,867
What?

178
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:05,746
That someone repaired the Going Merry.

179
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:07,957
It would be one thing if it was destroyed.

180
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,626
But since it's all fixed up, what's the problem?

181
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:14,171
Are you gonna go through the trouble of finding this guy so you can thank him?

182
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:17,341
Well, no, but...

183
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,138
How did he know?

184
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:31,756
Hey, Merry, can you hear me?!

185
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:43,701
Listen up.

186
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,514
It's time for usopp-sama, the chief of Operation,

187
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:49,014
Get Merry off the Sacrificial Altar, to make his appearance!

188
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,332
Watch me closely!

189
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:56,255
I'm the vice-chief of Operation Get Merry off the Sacrificial Altar!

190
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,716
They're gonna be relying on me!

191
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:05,222
What are you going to do, Usopp?

192
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:08,851
Yosh!

193
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:13,606
Chopper!

194
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:14,773
Aye!

195
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:21,739
Launch!

196
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,824
GO!

197
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,539
Yeah! He did it!

198
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:34,168
Chopper, floor it!

199
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,044
Awesome!

200
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:36,545
You're awesome, Usopp!

201
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:51,936
Usopp...

202
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,354
It didn't work...

203
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,147
Don't worry about it, Chopper.

204
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,610
Besides, I've prepared a secret plan for this very occasion!

205
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:02,696
Really? What kind of plan?

206
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:06,700
There's huge Skysharks swimming around here, right?

207
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:08,911
Yep, yep!

208
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,663
There's scores of them!

209
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:15,042
What if we used their power?

210
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,044
The Skysharks' power?

211
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:18,003
Right!

212
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,047
They're really strong!

213
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,483
I can speak to that!

214
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:25,010
There's something I'd like you to do.

215
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:28,639
Sure, whatever you say!

216
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:30,516
You can count on me!

217
00:17:31,014 --> 00:17:32,101
I'll do anything.

218
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:33,519
Yeah?

219
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,105
Well said!

220
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:47,074
Usopp!

221
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:50,327
Does... this mean... that I'm...

222
00:17:50,784 --> 00:17:54,581
The hungry Skysharks are gonna try to eat you!

223
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,375
I'm the bait!?

224
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:57,626
No, no!

225
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:00,337
I don't wanna be the bait!

226
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:11,015
HELP!!

227
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,558
Let 'er rip, Sanji!

228
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:29,992
Yosh!

229
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:37,207
Come and get it, Skyshark.

230
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,220
NO!!

231
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,055
DON'T MOVE!!

232
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:53,599
MOVE!

233
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,412
Yosha!

234
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:18,373
Yes! Yes! Usopp, banzai!

235
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,919
Yeah, it was nothing!

236
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:37,809
NO!!

237
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:43,273
Alright, look at the map.

238
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:45,526
The route the exploration team will be taking is...

239
00:19:45,526 --> 00:19:46,944
...directly south.

240
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,822
Here to the right there should be some ruins.

241
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,117
Beware of all the enemies along the way and bring back the gold!

242
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:56,036
You make it sound easy.

243
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,372
If it involves investigating ruins, I'll gladly do it.

244
00:19:58,495 --> 00:19:59,790
What about you?

245
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,542
You keep talking about gold and more gold and you're not gonna come?

246
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,836
Of course not!
It's scary there.

247
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:08,006
She wants the gold, but she's not willing to risk anything to get it!

248
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,342
Nami's strange! A real weirdo!

249
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,593
You say something?

250
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,560
Meanwhile, we'll take the Merry through the island.

251
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,145
It's be dangerous for us too.

252
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,899
We'll be heading towards the coast as fast as we can, so...

253
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,736
Let's meet here!

254
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,072
And then we'll escape from Sky Island!

255
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:37,786
We'll become a rich pirate crew!

256
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:38,787
Alright!

257
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,956
All the meat I can eat!

258
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,582
Escape...

259
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:43,959
That sounds great!

260
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,836
DON'T MAKE ME THE BAIT!

261
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:47,629
Look!

262
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,047
The Weather's perfect!

263
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,507
We're on top of the clouds, so yeah.

264
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:53,343
So, we'll all meet safely on the east coast!

265
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:54,261
Yosh!

266
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:55,595
Let's get going then!

267
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:56,763
Aye!

268
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:30,438
Who will encounter my Ordeal of String?

269
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,522
The Shandians?

270
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,834
Or the Blue Sea dwellers?

271
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,268
The festival is starting.

272
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,187
It shall be magnificient.

273
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,606
Today is a great day.

1
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
The Admiral is quite solitary.

2
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:01,180
Yes, it made all this way until on this remote island, and it was made a good friend…

3
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,450
It doesnot can any more what think now.

4
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,439
And tomorrow, we leave at dawn.

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,319
The villagers are ready to kill us
then we cannot speak to them.

6
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,230
And they did not sound
the bell today.

7
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,119
Do not show yourself!

8
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,490
You for you come repentance?!

9
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:46,680
Eternal friends! The bell of
oath resounds through the sea!

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,220
He well, it is really one
sad way of saying goodbye.

11
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,500
Excuse me…

12
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,550
Doctor?

13
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,359
MUSE-chan?

14
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,980
Do I can speak to you?

15
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,900
It is made pass for a botanist?!

16
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,650
Norland!

17
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,710
If this is a sacrifice
in the name of “progress”,

18
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,220
one should never have accommodated you here!

19
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,550
Ancestral Trees?

20
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,250
Yes.

21
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,350
We think that the hearts of our
ancestors died on this island…

22
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,180
follow the sound of the bell for
to come to rest in these trees.

23
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,530
Our legends all say that them
ancestors since the Old one of Shandora…

24
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,399
resident inside these
trees and take care on us.

25
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,690
These white trees
are crowned in our eyes.

26
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,820
For Shandia, the forest
ancestral Trees…

27
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,590
is rather important for
to be protected from our lives.

28
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,710
They were crowned for us!

29
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,130
And cut we them.

30
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,560
The warriors were furious
and they would have attacked you…

31
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,170
One will expel them this island!

32
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,270
But you saved
life of the villagers.

33
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,060
I see.

34
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,649
It is thus this driven back anger
who is the cause of their contempt.

35
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,159
Even if that belonged to
your research on the forest…

36
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,239
Even if you did not know…

37
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,869
The rage of the villagers
will not calm down.

38
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,070
Then, before you do not leave…

39
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,530
I wanted that you know the reason.

40
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,749
He! Hoist to me that!

41
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,419
Trees where resided
their ancestors?

42
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,749
It is really heavy!

43
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,959
Yes! Attach that quickly!

44
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,089
It was thus for that.

45
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,000
We have made the irrevocable one.

46
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,799
The villagers have
raison d'être in anger.

47
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
But, Admiral…

48
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,929
These trees were…

49
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,170
Pas la pains to find excuses!

50
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,840
I have make a thing
that I cannot assume!

51
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,220
The tinkling of the bell…

52
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,729
who represented the pride of the city…

53
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,020
and guided the hearts of theirs
ancestors towards this island was destroyed.

54
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,520
All these trees in which
these hearts resided…

55
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,480
our hands were cut!

56
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,150
It is an unforgivable act!

57
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,650
Admiral…

58
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,280
You all, listen!

59
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,070
WHAT?!

60
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,030
ONE DOES NOT CARRY GOLD?!

61
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,080
Norland and its crew
are on the point of weighing the anchor.

62
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,010
MUSE, from which do you come?

63
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,630
If…

64
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,680
If one of our invaluable trees…

65
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,649
had been devastated by
a terrible poison…

66
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,029
and that this tree…

67
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,409
all the forest would have contaminated,
and perhaps even, our people…

68
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,540
If this poison would have decimated the whole island,
and that we knew what would have occurred…

69
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,659
About what she does speak?

70
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,249
It is what this nonsense?

71
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,940
Then…

72
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,830
what we would have made…

73
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,160
with this invaluable tree?!

74
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,009
Dad, please, go ahead!

75
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,589
You must stop them!

76
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,549
Rubbish!

77
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,549
You know what they did!

78
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,710
If you them leashes to leave, you
will regret all your life!

79
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,680
He is the friend expensive
that you never had!

80
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,440
We will inflict wounds with the heroes
of Shandia, and never they will not cure!

81
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,810
What want you to say?!

82
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,859
I know that it is not an excuse,

83
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,819
but for the honor of the Admiral,
I believe that I should say it to you.

84
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,110
This forest of which you
speak had already died.

85
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,179
The true danger of
Fever of the Trees…

86
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,090
it is that it is rather powerful for
to infect as well the plants as the men.

87
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,180
The Admiral risked his life in order to convince you because it was aware of this dreadful reality.

88
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,729
Of the man to the forest, then
forest with the man…

89
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,529
In this way, an small island
would be completely devastated.

90
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,300
It already arrived.

91
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,359
But you do not have with you to make some.

92
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,230
Yesterday, all the forest
was screened.

93
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,459
We did not only know this
forest was so invaluable,

94
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,640
And we should have spoken to you about it.

95
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,639
Good, it is not with that only
we will be forgiven, but…

96
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,830
the botanists do not destroy
never the forest without reason.

97
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,360
The Admiral respects them
gods and deaths.

98
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,450
But it always knew…

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,000
what was most important.

100
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,580
Then, they made
that to protect us?

101
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,700
Dad!

102
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,500
I am afflicted, Norland!

103
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,790
You DOES NOT GO from THERE!

104
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,970
You did not forget anything?

105
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,189
If…

106
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,430
Stop groaning. It is like that.

107
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,439
Good, the anchor is weighed!

108
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,899
All at your stations!

109
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,779
We leave for the Kingdom Lvneel! (ya
not a lapse of memory of letters ds the name there? ^^)

110
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,980
Ouais!

111
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,699
NORLAND!

112
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,270
I have made a serious error!

113
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,110
WAIT PLEASE, NORLAND!

114
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,720
Hoist the veils!

115
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,240
What?

116
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,420
The bell sounds…

117
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,180
SOUND it!

118
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,099
We are afflicted, Norland-san!

119
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,509
Draw more extremely!

120
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,670
Norland and its crew
must hear it!

121
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,250
Admiral, look at!

122
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,560
NORLAND!

123
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,730
Karugara…

124
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,790
RETURN TO SEE US!

125
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,420
Norland…

126
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,880
I will await you on this ground!

127
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,130
I will continue to make
to resound the bell…

128
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,350
so that your boat finds the way!

129
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,360
So that even in full storm, you
can find the way of this island!

130
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,640
I will sound the bell and will await you!

131
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,499
One will be re-examined…

132
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,120
MY FRIEND!

133
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,240
Then…

134
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,250
I will be able to return?

135
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,759
I will return!

136
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,210
I swear it! I will return!

137
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,170
ONE SE WILL FIND!

140
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,520
North Blue
- Kingdom of Luvneel

141
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,070
a man named lived Montblanc Norland.

142
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:53,250
Norland was an explorer who liked
to make the account of fantastic adventures.

143
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,450
And people of its village never knew
if he told the truth or if he lied.

144
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,560
One day, while returning of a forwarding,
Norland went to present his report/ratio to the King.

145
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,939
Although it was destroyed a long time ago,
the city preserves all its pride and its beauty.

146
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,800
The city of Shandora!

147
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,810
It is really the City of Gold!

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,109
- 5 years later
-

149
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,070
Marijoe approved your
forwarding on Large Line.

150
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,739
I name again you Admiral
vessel of forwarding.

151
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,409
Lord, I accept with honor.

152
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,450
However, this time this boat
will be equipped with my soldiers…

153
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,209
and I will accompany you
personally.

154
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,539
Included/understood?

155
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,479
Yes!

156
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,650
- 1 year earlier -
The Arrival of Norland -

157
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,089
Karugara!

158
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,049
Seto?

159
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,919
You will make sound the bell?

160
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,550
I will help you.

161
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,429
He, Nora,

162
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,880
you seem happy of
to live in the ruins.

163
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,680
He, when you believe that Norland-san
and will its crew return?

164
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,680
You requests always
that when you come here.

165
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,640
He will come when he is ready.

166
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,879
He was born very far from here
in the North Sea.

167
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,899
And it has a family in her Kingdom.

168
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,110
But, we made a promise.

169
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,540
If we continue to sound
the bell, they will return.

170
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,079
What it is?!

171
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,480
They are not ordinary darkness!

172
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,789
Come, Seto!

173
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,320
We must protect the village!

174
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,590
Why?

175
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,350
The island stops here.

176
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,489
Salt dog!

177
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,900
You oses to disappoint me?!

178
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,400
WHERE IS GOLD?!

179
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,950
Where is the village?

180
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,919
Something arrived at the island!

181
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,629
Karugara, if you are always
in life, lets hear it to me!

182
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,459
Sound the Gold Bell!

183
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,719
By pity answers…

184
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,450
with the Flame of Shandora!

185
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,210
Public execution of Norland
is about to start!

186
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,590
He, By here the guy!

187
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,349
Six years ago, on the island
of Jaya on Large Line,

188
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,890
I saw the Gold City!

189
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,470
The Gold City exists!

190
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,189
We will listen to the continuation of one of those
who accompanied your forwarding.

191
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,940
Is its testimony true?

192
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,730
Not, it is a web of lies.

193
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,949
What!

194
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,789
Is Norland-san a liar?

195
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,199
Then, all these stories that it
we told are lies?

196
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,579
What a horrible man!

197
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,200
He made accept all the kingdom
how it was a kind of hero!

198
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,289
Who is this witness?! It
is not our companion!

199
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,370
Didn't you see Karugara and his tribe?

200
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,250
Admiral, that it occurred?!

201
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,160
Retain them.

202
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
Shit!

203
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,200
The guy…

204
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,769
Explorer Montblanc Norland.

205
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,260
For the high crime to have disappointed
the King, you are condemned to death!

206
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,890
LIAR!

207
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,539
The forever lied Admiral!

208
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,859
Admiral!

209
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:55,700
LIAR!!

210
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,400
God, it is enormous
piece of Vearth!

211
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,959
You hear that?

212
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,669
Song of this Vearth.

213
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,419
It is the birth of a crowned ground!

214
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,190
It is…

215
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,290
the place where I should live!

216
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,960
What… did it occur?

217
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,469
What?

218
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,670
I breathe with difficulty.

219
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,179
Is everyone well?

220
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,849
You awake!

221
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,889
You awake!

222
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,010
You occupy casualties, quickly!

223
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,300
Karugara, of the intruders!

224
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,519
This Vearth will be with me!

225
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,970
I am God!

226
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,989
You are God?!

227
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,730
You with the combat, warriors prepare!

228
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,520
We cannot them
to let take this ground!

229
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,780
I promised it to you, Norland.

230
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,360
One day, we will be re-examined.

231
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,119
Karugara…

232
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,539
Where are you?

233
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,410
When you return in Jaya…

234
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,169
What you will think when
you will see us parties?

235
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,839
Wait still a little.

236
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,490
I you will make it hear soon!

237
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,090
“We are there”!

238
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,250
Es you still in life?

239
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,840
I have to say to you so much.

240
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,550
Karugara…

241
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,550
I fear the worst for you.

242
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,820
We will be re-examined one day
on this ground, Norland!

243
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,940
LET US LIGHT THE FLAME OF SHANDORA!

244
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,270
The Large Karugara Warrior continued
to howl these words during the battle.

245
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:26,540
He thought that to sound the Flame of
Shandora, even once, would say all to them.

246
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,160
“We are there”.

247
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,330
But, the Bell did not sound.

248
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,340
Years later, a boat coming from
Mer Bleue brought news to our village.

249
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,510
Our saver, Norland,
pride of our city…

250
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:50,890
was treated of liar, and died, without
to never deny the existence of Shandora.

251
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,479
But, even if it were too late,

252
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,940
the Large Karugara Warrior continued
to be a large warrior, here in the sky.

253
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,159
Its failure to deliver
its feelings…

254
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,949
was…

255
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,730
the greatest regret of
Large Karugara Warrior!

256
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,820
Can that still reach it?

257
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,499
If the Bell sounds now,

258
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,280
Will these words reach Norland?

259
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,120
They would have.

260
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,580
We are close to the Paradise, here.

261
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,589
Wiper!

262
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,540
If you fled not, you will die!

263
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,290
He!

264
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,759
Wiper…

265
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,210
Eneru!

266
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,550
What gives you
right all to take?

267
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,310
It is the sky! The field of God!

268
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,729
All this is only one affront!

269
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,469
People, trees and ground!

270
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,109
It is necessary that they turn over to their place!

271
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,820
They will become a rain which
will fall down on the Blue Sea!

272
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,039
Quickly!

273
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,110
Angel Island is on
the point to sink!

274
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,700
We have many accidents!

275
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,080
Bring them to the boats, and
look after them directly over there!

276
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,879
Will run!

277
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,660
With the sea, quickly!

278
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,299
I shiver while thinking of what would be
arrived if this girl had not convinced me.

279
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,210
Is it healthy and safe?

280
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,010
She already took much altitude.

281
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,180
In little time, the arch
the summit of bean will have reached.

282
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,149
What can seek Eneru well up there?

283
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,489
He wants the Gold Bell hidden in top.

284
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,680
A Bell?

285
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,329
You save now, the angels!

286
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,570
You are anything else only of
tiny ants now.

287
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,630
Turn over to your place, Skypiea!

288
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,950
What it is?!

289
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,710
A hole open in the Sea of Opal!

290
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,920
This old Divine Sanctuary
is not useful to me any more with nothing.

291
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,050
Nor the city of Shandora in lower part!

292
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,570
There is from now on only one
thing which interests me in this country!

293
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,570
The Large Gold Belfry!

294
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,900
I hear two votes which approaches.

295
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,780
Brothel, how it can
to run also quickly?

296
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,280
Nami, I hope that you are well!

297
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:52,130
And I will not leave you
to take the Gold Bell, Eneru!

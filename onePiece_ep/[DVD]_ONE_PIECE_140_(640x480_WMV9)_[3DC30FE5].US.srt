1
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,800
Then it is you the poor cretins which refused to pay the harbor tax.

2
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,450
Sanji!

3
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,190
Shit! What does it make?

4
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,430
It is that the Rainbow of the Fogs?

5
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,580
Is professor, which this place?

6
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,510
It is Ape' S Concert.

7
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,550
Ape' S Concert? Would this be…?

8
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,720
What is it?

9
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,810
A place from where one will be able to never arise now that we entered there.

10
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,780
A cemetery of boats.

11
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:47,250
Inhabitants of Nowhere!

12
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:47,250
Pumpkin Pirates!

13
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,490
He! Look at!

14
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,710
There are boats shipwrecked men everywhere!

15
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,140
Do not say that.

16
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,880
I have the impression that the phantom of a pirate captain of boat will come to attack us.

17
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,590
It is true?

18
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,330
PHANTOM CAPTAIN!

19
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,140
Does not call them!

20
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,160
“Last the misty Rainbow, you enter the ground of the gods.”

21
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,370
“The last paradise remaining on Earth.”

22
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,610
“A place filled of gold and money where people perish famished.”

23
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,310
Here what they say in the book.

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,190
It is as I said it.

25
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,810
Anything else that a legend.

26
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,490
Did professor, you know that this place was a cemetery of boats?

27
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,960
Yes. I already had an outline of this place 50 years ago.

28
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,640
You knew? Then why…?

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,660
I had warned you before…

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,460
I tried to find a means of saving my friends who had been aspired in the Rainbow of the Fogs.

31
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,840
And it is for that I did not worry about people who showed me finger and called me the puppy of Whetton behind my back.

32
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,090
Oi!

33
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Look at that!

34
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,030
My god…

35
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,010
They is too cool, hein?

36
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,690
There is much in the other boats!

37
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,690
Let us continue to explore!

38
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:27,480
It is perhaps not the paradise, but you cannot deny that there are enormously treasures here, Professor.

39
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,550
Who dares to disturb deaths which sleep…

40
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,990
Is Qu-Qu'est-ce-que it?

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,450
Give up this trunk and leave this place!

42
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:55,780
Ok.

43
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,660
Or if not, the plague of dead will fall down on you!

44
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,580
I am afraid…

45
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,510
Who are you?

46
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,960
They are làààààà!

47
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,610
Now leave the trunk, or if not…

48
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,630
It was close! Bandage idiots…!

49
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,820
Phantom captain!

50
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,810
There is nothing in lower part!

51
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,710
FANTOOOOMMMMEEESSSS!

52
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,460
But the arrow seemed to come from here.

53
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,480
What?

54
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,080
Luffy!

55
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,760
By-there! There is somebody by-there!

56
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,680
OOOhhh!

57
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,240
Listen to me!

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
Luffy!

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,460
Luffy!

60
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,420
Oh! An arc.

61
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,230
Luffy, pay attention!

62
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,210
Luffy!

63
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,850
It is small that…!

64
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,360
HISTSUKAEN BOSHI

65
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,360
[Devastating Star of fire]

66
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,110
What?

67
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,720
Akibi!

68
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,100
Wait, Longo!

69
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,310
Akibi!

70
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,300
Calm yourself, Longo!

71
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,530
Oh! They are right children.

72
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,330
Longo!

73
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,960
Akibi!

74
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,030
Idiot!

75
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
Go -t'en!

76
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,420
GOMU GOMU NO!

77
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,080
DAMEDA!

78
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,080
[Stop that]

79
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,200
Yo, thank you for presently.

80
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,590
But, of nothing.

81
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,420
Longo!

82
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,260
Stop that!

83
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,110
“Ape' S Concert” is the property of Pumpkins Pirates!

84
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,520
If you do not want to die, let my companions leave and give up the trunk!

85
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,010
A bomb?

86
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,490
Lapanui!

87
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,420
Is this…?

88
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,550
Oh, oh, oh… if you use that, you will kill everyone here!

89
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,810
We all will be carried!

90
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,160
Between the life and death, we will always choose the best!

91
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,410
Allons-y!

92
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,220
I am afflicted, Lapanui. Longo!

93
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,450
Ok!

94
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,150
Lapanui…

95
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Is Lapanui, well you?

96
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,750
And… Isoka and Longo?

97
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,560
It is you…

98
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,510
You do not recognize me? It is me!

99
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,980
I learned how to play with you in the Cape Ruluka. It is me, Henzo!

100
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Henzo?

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,560
You know them?

102
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,860
Henzo?

103
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,960
You want to say that… He?

104
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,590
I-idiot, that cannot be him!

105
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,070
Does not approach you nearer!

106
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,740
J I will explode it!

107
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,840
Do not take a step moreover!

108
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,720
Stop!

109
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Boom n°3.

110
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,860
One of my inventions.

111
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,020
I only use it to frighten people.

112
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,660
Thin! A smoke-producing bomb!

113
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,160
It is what this brothel? You of made of the noise the guy!

114
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,300
You only have just awaked?

115
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,830
Wait, which it is this type?

116
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,910
If I try to explain you, that will take hours.

117
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,450
Oh, they left.

118
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,190
Who were these kids?

119
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,730
He…

120
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,450
Ossan!

121
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,150
Henzo, hurries to join us!

122
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,960
I am afraid!

123
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,780
You do not have to be afraid!

124
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,170
We are Pumpkins Pirates!

125
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,280
When I am tall, I will be a true pirate!

126
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,990
But Lapanui, your father is a Marine.

127
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,960
You think that it will let you make?

128
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,460
Dad, it is dad.

129
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,290
I want to go in a place where nobody forever be!

130
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,980
Did a place where nobody never go?

131
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,590
Ouais! There is full with unexplored places throughout the world!

132
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,620
I want to also see these places.

133
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,670
Me too.

134
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,220
I want to also be pirate!

135
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,020
But then, you are not likely to have to fight the other pirates?

136
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,320
Somebody the timorous one as me will be able to never do that.

137
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,360
Henzo, you are good to invent heaps of things.

138
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,260
You can invent things which will be useful to us in our venture!

139
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,150
Yes!

140
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,620
Then, I will be too a pirate me!

141
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,140
Ca gives pleasure to hear.

142
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,890
We were so happy.

143
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,790
To play with my companions, to speaking with all the others, I spent the best moments of all my life until now.

144
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,660
No treasure could replace…

145
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,470
all these happy days.

146
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,600
So far terrible.

147
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,340
Henzo!

148
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,220
Henzo! Does Ca go?

149
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,880
Boom n°3 is now finished!

150
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,400
Imbecile!

151
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,990
Do not frighten us any more like that!

152
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,860
You do not have anything but that could have been dangerous!

153
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,160
Ca does not feel good!

154
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
The city is on fire!

155
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,070
Any Ruluka is burning!

156
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,910
It is not true…

157
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,610
Our city…

158
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,940
Dad! Mom!

159
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,090
Longo!

160
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,880
Burn! Burn!

161
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,740
Take all that has value!

162
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,590
And if somebody opposes to the Pirates of Whetton…

163
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,730
Kill them! It is included/understood?

164
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,560
Do not hesitate, for anybody!

165
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
A pirate!

166
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,210
Then there are still people who did not flee.

167
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,090
Listen, the guy.

168
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,410
If we can arrive to the port, one will be able to have a boat!

169
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,660
Let us steal one, any! And let us flee!

170
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,840
But what did it arrive at my parents?

171
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,690
Idiot!

172
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,760
You want to die?

173
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Now go ahead!

174
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,140
Dirty kids.

175
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,190
Boats…

176
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,960
These types all ran them…

177
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,980
There!

178
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,240
Let us take that one!

179
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,450
That one?

180
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,620
It is our only chance, not?

181
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,320
You dispatch!

182
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,270
What will they make on my boat?

183
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,500
Shit!

184
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,360
Splash!

185
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,980
I hope that you made your prayers.

186
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,430
You dispatch! Climb up there!

187
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,130
A kid as you cannot use this axe.

188
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,170
Would not be insolate, kid.

189
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,990
I am not a kid.

190
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,910
I am the leader of Pumpkins Pirates!

191
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,110
Lapanui!

192
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,230
Lapanui!

193
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,230
Ca will go!

194
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,310
There is only one guy!

195
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,450
If we put ourselves at it all together, we can beat it!

196
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,580
He Captain!

197
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,060
We already took again the sea?

198
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,340
IT THERE OF ANOTHER!

199
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,050
Hein? Who are you?

200
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,990
What is it?

201
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,060
The Rainbow of the Fogs!

202
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,800
Oh! Quickly, turn the bar!

203
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,740
If we enter there, we will be able to never come out from it!

204
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,190
THE BAR EAST CASSEE!

205
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,700
You… really returned to me furious.

206
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,330
Akibi!

207
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,340
You will not leave this alive boat!

208
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,900
Akibi!

209
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,010
Its shoulder is uncoupled!

210
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,190
Lapanui!

211
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,040
Now you will die!

212
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,170
Henzo!

213
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,380
Henzo!

214
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Let us turn over behind!

215
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,870
Let us make make half-turn with the boat!

216
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,240
We cannot! The bar is broken!

217
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,140
The Rainbow of the Fogs! The Rainbow of the Fogs…!

218
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,460
Lapanui!

219
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,310
Go ahead! Go from the front one!

220
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,210
Do not forget me!

221
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Henzo!

222
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,910
I will be always with you!

223
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,160
I am me also Pumpkins Pirate!

224
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,240
Henzo…

225
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,370
And then…

226
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,510
And then, Lapanui and the others never returned.

227
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,450
I will never have imagined that they were here, working like pirate truths.

228
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,960
But isn't that occurred 50 years ago?

229
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,100
The four that one saw were children.

230
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,450
Usopp! It seems that the course of time is different inside the Rainbow from the Fogs.

231
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,140
Perhaps one day here represents a week.

232
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,540
Not, perhaps that represents even a year in the external world.

233
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,960
What?

234
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,790
If it is the case, it will be necessary to find a means of leaving from here quickly.

235
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,900
Or if not we will be able to leave there never again.

236
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,720
How that?

237
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,440
Be idiotic for you.

238
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,080
What occurred for these kids and Ossan can arrive to us too!

239
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,280
While we well wisely remain here sitted,

240
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,940
Nami and the others will become of collapsing old men!

241
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,160
WHAT?

242
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Oi, Ossan!

243
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Let us leave from here, quickly!

244
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,750
IDIOT!

245
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,000
We do not know HOW to leave from there.

246
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:10,910
What?

247
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,790
It is true that?

248
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,010
Then there is not only we donot can make?

249
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,430
Moron… You listened to me?

250
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,960
Not.

251
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,470
There must be a means.

252
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,620
It was said to you, see… three times already!

253
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,660
A means of leaving Ape' S Concert.

254
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,780
OAU, how much time?

255
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,160
Pfff, it does not seem to want to give up!

256
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,130
These weapons are really painful!

257
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,010
Enough spoken!

258
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,940
It is the end!

259
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,950
Reik-sama!

260
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,410
Does Ca go Reik-sama?

261
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,910
Who dared to throw this part on me?

262
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,160
It was not us.

263
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,150
Did you see?

264
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,810
It received this part in full head…

265
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,280
I asked whether it were you!

266
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,570
And if it were the case?

267
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,860
Well.

268
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,170
YOU WANTED RIGHT CA?

269
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,410
The marine charge is now paid.

270
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:19,660
You are officially inhabitants of Ruluka.

271
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,870
Ape' S Concert?

272
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:32,480
Ouais, the other patrol craft saw your boat entering the Rainbow of the Fogs.

273
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,160
The Mayor said…

274
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,020
That there was a treasure worthy of the ransom of one king inside.

275
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,670
Treasury?

276
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,430
Ape' S Concert is a cemetery of boats.

277
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,860
The rare people to be arisen about it speak about trunks filled with treasures.

278
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:55,360
The Mayor wants this treasure and asked Professor Henzo to find a way to enter there.

279
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,380
Oh, and this electric armor, it is one of its inventions!

280
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,400
It is really, very cool, isn't this?

281
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,810
This type likes to speak.

282
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,160
I suppose that he speaks about the type which wanted this tax.

283
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,410
We cannot remain here!

284
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,420
We must also enter ourselves this Rainbow of the Fogs!

285
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,380
Yes, Sir, Nami-san!

286
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,110
- Yes, Sir, Nami-san!
- But once inside, we will be able to never come out from it!

287
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,660
Am not afraid!

288
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,760
This treasure awaits only us!

289
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,400
He

290
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,620
I will not let to you enter Ape' S Concert from my city.

291
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,680
Grandpa!

292
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,640
You, idiotic!

293
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,680
Grandpa?

294
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,800
You do not remember the EC what I said to you.

295
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,900
How much time will I have to say it to you?

296
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,830
When you address yourself to me…

297
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,020
Call me Mr. Mayor.

298
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,800
Whetton mayor.

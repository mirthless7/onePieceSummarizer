1
00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:01,460
The famous hunter of pirates!

2
00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:01,460
The wandering bretor, Zoro

3
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,300
One will drink all the alcohol of this bar!

4
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
Oi! Billy!

5
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,780
How do you make to drink as much?

6
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,180
What do I know some?

7
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,250
Yosaku (a few years ago)

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,930
This guy… One offers 5.000.000 berrys for his head.

9
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,960
Johnny (a few years ago)

10
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,980
5.000.000 of berrys?

11
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,340
What do you say some?

12
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,920
It is left?

13
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,310
Oi, Johnny…

14
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,100
One cannot continue to run afterwards of the guy unimportant all the time.

15
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,620
The bargain hunters must show their courage and seek the large catches!

16
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,450
But if one tries to catch it, one is likely to remain there.

17
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,900
I drop the 5.000.000 from berrys.

18
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,540
Give me to eat.

19
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,270
You ace of the money?

20
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,620
Not yet.

21
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,070
But…

22
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,610
I will have some when I collect the premium for this guy behind me.

23
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,420
What do you tell?

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Before you me sizes,

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,640
I will have reduced to you in crumbs!

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,390
Do not tire me too much.

27
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,110
I am too hungry.

28
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,240
Answer me!

29
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,830
Does Y' have a premium on your head?

30
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,080
Ouais! Listen to that!

31
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,310
My head is worth 5.000.000 of berrys.

32
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,100
Good Ah?

33
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,260
Ca should be enough.

34
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,020
What?

35
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,640
Here your money.

36
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,060
Give me to eat now.

37
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,600
O-Oui, Me sior! Immediately!

38
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,420
This guy, it is good.

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,140
I do not see it in the research opinions.

40
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,540
If it were an bargain hunter, people would have recognized it…

41
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,570
You believe that could be celebrates it hunter of pirates?

42
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,150
I intended to say that it is very strong…

43
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,110
Not, the hunter of pirates uses three katana.

44
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,440
And one of them is Meitou with a white sleeve.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,870
Moreover, it is said that this guy is a demon which would have taken the shape of a man.

46
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,150
He surely does not resemble that.

47
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,580
In this case…

48
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,160
One cannot leave it, after it took our target!

49
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,560
Oi, Johnny!

50
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,090
Oi oi, Nii-san…

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,850
If are to you an bargain hunter, I will demandrai you to follow our rules.

52
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,010
One does not want to cause problems with the bar,

53
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,920
Then it was waited until it left to catch it.

54
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,200
One had seen this guy the first.

55
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,100
Oi! Oi!

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,970
You did not hear me!?

57
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,310
There are rules between bargain hunters!

58
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,740
Eye of Falcon.

59
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,090
You know Mihawk Oeil of Falcon?

60
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,760
You want to say Mihawk Shichibukai?

61
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,760
[Shichibukai = Captain Corsair]

62
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,140
I travel to beat it and become the largest bretor of the world.

63
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,600
Times, I need a premium to eat.

64
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,350
But I am not an bargain hunter.

65
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,330
The largest bretor of the world?

66
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,700
Hear you that, my pal!

67
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,680
It is impossible! You ace not a chance!

68
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,200
You dreams, it is all!

69
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,540
I decided it when I was kid.

70
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,140
It does not matter what the others say.

71
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,150
Even if it is your dream of childhood…

72
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
It is right…

73
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,190
I did not know that it was with you.

74
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,250
Afflicted!

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,670
Bring back it to the Navy.

76
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,110
The premium is with you.

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,250
V-Vraiment?

78
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,560
But do not forget to pay my note here.

79
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,970
There was the jackpot!

80
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,280
5.000.000 of berrys!

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,670
Now, one can put the job on side for some time without dying of hunger.

82
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,200
Oi! What doesn't go?

83
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,620
Do not be content for you?

84
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,200
He…

85
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,590
Why did you become bargain hunter?

86
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,420
Hein? Why?

87
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,970
It is not obvious?

88
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
It is to eat!

89
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,310
I was born in a village from countryside.

90
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,790
Gangsters always came to plunder it.

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,170
But then,

92
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,220
A group of bargain hunters continued them.

93
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,670
I wished to become like the bargain hunter

94
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,510
who defied these gangsters valiantly.

95
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,900
Now, I am there thanks to these ambitions.

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,610
“Perhaps a day I will be able to overcome these dirty rat just like him.”

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,090
It is what I said myself.

98
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,120
And there, a few years later, I decided to become bargain hunter.

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,730
In fact, I always wanted the being too.

100
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,160
When I heard what this “better world” said,

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,360
that made me look at behind and recall these days.

102
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,390
Oh! What is what you do to me there?

103
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,540
Ca does not resemble itself.

104
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,680
Oh, your mouth!

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,270
What occurs?

106
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,510
What doesn't go?

107
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,200
It occurred something?

108
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,470
Gangsters!

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,000
The band with Dick attacks the stores at the end of the city!

110
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,010
Dick the Gangster?

111
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,270
I have it.

112
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,840
Whore! 10.000.000 of berrys for this scélérat!

113
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,290
Go the guy…

114
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,480
Plunder at will!

115
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,850
Ouais!!

116
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,320
There is to take much here!

117
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,210
One was not mistaken today.

118
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,780
It is them.

119
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,640
Does Oi, what one make?

120
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,330
They all will take!

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,750
One cannot undertake these gangsters!

122
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,100
If it take your life, not average to take it again!

123
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,010
Whore…

124
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,410
Well, with the following.

125
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,520
Empty all!

126
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,910
Ouais!

127
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,390
What do these idiots of villager make there?

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,100
It is right a band of yellowbellies!

129
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,490
They do not have the notch to be opposed to me!

130
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,740
Or then, they are just there to look at.

131
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,120
Robber or stolen.

132
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,700
Nowadays, be to you one or the other.

133
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,500
To be weak is a crime in oneself.

134
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,370
Only an idiot tries to be opposed to more extremely!

135
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,590
There is an idiot here?

136
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,850
R-Rends our food!

137
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,910
Everyone worked hard to have it!

138
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,140
One needs some for ourself!

139
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,940
Harry!

140
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,740
Apparently, you have at least notch.

141
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,110
Shit!

142
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,690
Harry! Not!

143
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,790
You ace no chance!

144
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,860
Harry!

145
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,750
One will help it!

146
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,560
Does not go there, partner.

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,490
If it is attacked, one will be made kill.

148
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,190
It is not that.

149
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,480
This kid…

150
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,650
He is like me at the time!

151
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,390
before I do not become egoistic.

152
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,360
When I was only one impressionable kid!

153
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,940
Oi! JOHNNY!

154
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,840
What is that you want, good-for-nothings?

155
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,040
Who are you?

156
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,640
We are the famous bargain hunters!

157
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,720
What?

158
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,330
Then you are bargain hunters.

159
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,040
And I am your target?

160
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,700
You, imprudent good-for-nothings, you type me on the nerves.

161
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,750
What?

162
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,880
If it is money which you want, I will spin you from there so that you break.

163
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,570
As long as you do not disturb me.

164
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,130
One does not want any!

165
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,000
Today one feels like dispensers of justice to change!

166
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,540
Hein? Johnny.

167
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,960
Dispensers of justice?

168
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,260
Oi!

169
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,240
Partner.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,570
Do you want to help me to be a man?

171
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,760
Johnny?

172
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,980
Johnny? You…

173
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,910
Very well.

174
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,520
Now, there is no more good or of evil!

175
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,440
The law of the strongest!

176
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,790
There is only that!

177
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,190
One is serious!

178
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,180
Brothel!

179
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,480
One nevertheless delivered a type which is worth 5.000.000 of berrys to the Navy this morning?

180
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,050
Navy?

181
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,050
Billy…

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,780
YOU SUMMERS THOSE WHICH TOOK MY LITTLE BROTHER!?

183
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,920
WHAT!!

184
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,190
The katana that I left is ready?

185
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,490
Yes!

186
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,030
Very good work!

187
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,550
Ca was not easy.

188
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,400
You are too hard with this beautiful katana.

189
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,190
An ordinary katana would have had the same destiny as the two others katanas that you brought.

190
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,530
I see.

191
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,960
I will pay more attention.

192
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,590
I will become stronger… for it!!

193
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,550
Until my name reaches the skies…

194
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,870
I will become stronger!!

195
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,690
I will become the largest bretor of the world!

196
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,880
Thank you to have repaired it!

197
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,220
I would like to pay you for work,

198
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,660
But there, I am ruined.

199
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,180
Forget that.

200
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,790
They are not the every day that such a wonder is seen.

201
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,620
It was a true pleasure.

202
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,940
This old gross sword does not even make the weight.

203
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,240
Oi, Oi, wait. You joke?

204
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,900
How did you do that?

205
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,600
With this pace, you will break each blade which you will touch!

206
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,420
Shit, I broke another of them…

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,150
Afflicted, I promise to pay you.

208
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,140
Dick the Whale of the Mountains

209
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,270
It is a gangster who fights with a giant firearm. There is a premium of 10.000.000 berrys for its head.

210
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,530
Gangster?

211
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,900
Precedes?

212
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,010
Whore!!

213
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,810
It is nutcase!

214
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,070
It are not even able to touch it

215
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,380
What arrives to you, good-for-nothings?

216
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,610
You really had my little brother?

217
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,470
It was only delivered. It is someone else who overcame it.

218
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,870
What do you say CA?

219
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,600
Of what you do praise yourself?

220
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,120
I said myself well that you were weak.

221
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,850
Your mouth!!

222
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,520
Well.

223
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,240
You do not know when it is necessary to leave!

224
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,140
Stopped He!!

225
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,490
Still you.

226
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,980
I saw you enough!

227
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,140
Chief!

228
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,890
One put the spoils in the cart.

229
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,140
Well!

230
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,560
I believe that it is the moment to leave.

231
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,720
These good-for-nothings make me waste my time.

232
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,490
Wait!

233
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,610
Wait here, criminal!

234
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,400
One avoided risking our life vis-a-vis hundreds of sought criminals, but…

235
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,840
to let you flee in front of our eyes…

236
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,010
would be an unbearable humiliation!

237
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,650
Do not even test.

238
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,750
You do not have anything to gain there.

239
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,480
It is perhaps not what an bargain hunter should do…

240
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,170
But…

241
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,890
Times it are necessary to know to fight until death!

242
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,590
You are insane truths.

243
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,480
You knew it since the beginning!

244
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,580
I suppose that yes.

245
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,620
Go the guy, finish them!

246
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,000
Ouais!!

247
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,340
Let to me go there!

248
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,910
It fight because of me!

249
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,620
If you will fight…

250
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,480
Reflected!

251
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,470
Think so that YOU can make.

252
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,330
Which pity, they are completely useless.

253
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,130
Their faces is completely marked by the blows.

254
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,680
It is the moment to finish some.

255
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,830
You to crush did not bring the least benefit to me.

256
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,080
I suppose that it was the destiny.

257
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,990
You were not likely to fall on me.

258
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,950
I will kill you together, are not sad.

259
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,810
Good then!

260
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,610
Go!

261
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,490
It is not enough?

262
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,700
The combat is finished.

263
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,550
You?

264
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,000
Since this morning.

265
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,670
Afflicted, but I can take your target once again?

266
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,170
I need money.

267
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,450
Ouais.

268
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,250
OK!

269
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,270
This man…

270
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,290
A katana with a white sleeve

271
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,330
I will borrow your sabers too.

272
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,750
Of agreement, but…

273
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,280
what you go…

274
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,800
Three katanas?

275
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,890
CA cannot…!

276
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,070
The hunter of pirates! Roronoa Zoro!!

277
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,380
Then here the famous hunter of pirates?

278
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,300
Now I do what?

279
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,820
I found my forces.

280
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,400
But if I do too much of it, my katana will break.

281
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,700
I should not act imprudently.

282
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,200
I must be able to call upon all the force of each one of my katanas.

283
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,820
Roronoa Zoro!

284
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,230
Even by using three katanas,

285
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,280
you do not think all of overcoming us at the same time?

286
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,600
“To use” three katanas…

287
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,240
and to practice the “Santouryuu”, it is not the same thing.

291
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,990
All on him!!

292
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,580
Whoa! It all had them!!

293
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,750
It is incredible!

294
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,050
Caution!

295
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,590
COOL!

296
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,040
Great hit…

297
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,030
I said to you never to approach me.

298
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,200
You will catch cold like that.

299
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,570
Those which catch cold have the weak heart.

300
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,180
Then, somebody will have heard the rumors on Zoro, the hunter of pirates.

301
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,270
Do not call me hunter of pirates.

302
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,200
Then which gave you a so pretty name?

303
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,080

1
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:16,460
A serious combat!

2
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:16,460
Luffy VS Zoro:The duel inatendu!

3
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,330
I cannot die here…

4
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,380
I have an important mission to achieve!

5
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,950
You are really pathetic!

6
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,970
You to make beat by a poor wretch swashbuckler.

7
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,170
Mr. 5, Valentine Miss!
Why are you here?

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,820
With my opinion, you know it already.

9
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,460
The Boss sent bus of the criminals here to us hide in this city.

10
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,750
The exact words of the Boss are:

11
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,020
“Somebody bored my secrecy.”

12
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,010
Obviously, I do not know this secrecy.

13
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,450
Therefore, we made an investigation to discover which could have bored the secrecy of the Boss.

14
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,660
The result was surprising!

15
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,390
We discovered that members placed high of a certain kingdom had infiltrated Baroque Works!

16
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,850
We are discovered!

17
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,400
We are rotten…

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,510
I will not let to you touch the Princess!

19
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
On my name of Captain of the Royal Guard of Arabasta, I will prevent you!

20
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,830
Igaram!

21
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,880
The Captain of the Royal Guard of Arabasta, Igaram.

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,210
And the Princess Nefertari Vivi.

23
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,870
By order of the Boss of Works Baroque, you must be eliminated.

24
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,270
Eh well…

25
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,340
And Luffy which is still in bottom…

26
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,940
Quickly, Vivi-Sama!
You escape while it is still time!

27
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,890
Igaram!

28
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,230
Igaram!
Useless.

29
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,080
Monsters…

30
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,860
Then you are a princess, Miss Wednesday!

31
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Stop making the clown, Mr. 9!

32
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,910
This night is less and less sure.

33
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,280
VI… Vivi-Sama!

34
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,280
Igaram!

35
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,310
You are well?

36
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,500
Vivi-Sama.

37
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,140
Of made you not for me.

38
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,880
Dispatch you to flee from here,

39
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,560
for the safeguard of our country!

40
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,640
Without you, the kingdom of Arabasta goes…

41
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,630
Go! You dispatch!

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,870
Do not even think of escaping to you.

43
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,770
Do not underestimate me!

44
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,150
I do not include/understand all well that occurs here…

45
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,050
But since we were partners so a long time,

46
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,500
I will try to delay them.

47
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,140
Go ahead, Miss Wednesday.

48
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,880
Mr. 9!

49
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,190
I am rather well, not?

50
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,060
Bye bye, baby!

51
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,800
The only thing which we need,
it is the will to achieve our mission.

52
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,160
This connery of friendship is only one invitation to die.

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,530
You will include/understand it!

54
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,170
Mr. 9!

55
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,190
Hey, hey! Here are dangerous droppings of nose!

56
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,530
Hein? You want what?

57
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,240
Master swashbuckler, you have such a force.

58
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,430
Do I can ask you for an irrational favor?

59
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,290
Ca does not interest me! Release me! Low legs!

60
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,540
These deux-là has the capacities of the Fruits of the Demon!

61
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,990
I am not size vis-a-vis them.

62
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,700
I entreat you! Protect the Princess in my place! You accept?

63
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,120
Karu! With the gallop!

64
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,170
She flees!

65
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,310
She will not go far.

66
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,110
Allons-y, Miss Valentine!

67
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,560
Yes, Mr. 5!

68
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,260
The kingdom of Arabasta is far in the east from here.

69
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,880
If you take along the healthy Princess there and saves,

70
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,660
you will touch surely a very large reward!

71
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,600
I entreat you!

72
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,760
Protect the Princess!

73
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,700
Doesn't Ca go in your head?

74
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,870
I announce you that you tried to kill us!

75
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,380
Do not oblige me to cut itself into two!

76
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,430
It is true this history of reward?

77
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,910
It is a sound which I adore.
Is 10 Billion Berrys, it honest, not?

78
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,040
Nami!

79
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,720
10… 10 millia… My my maaa.

80
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,160
I believed you in the vapes.

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,450
Oh, go…

82
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,160
Does a city have a cast which organizes a great festival when pirates pass there?

83
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,380
Which idiot would be made have by a similar blow?

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,730
I made seeming! Seeming!

85
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,870
I could still swallow some much more!

86
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,400
Ah, super…

87
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,520
Then? It is of agreement for the 10 Billion Berrys, Mister Capitaine of the Guard?

88
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,060
If you are not helped, your invaluable Princesse will remain there.

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,400
I am only one private.
I then to promise this sum.

90
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,810
You want to make me believe that the Princess is not worth this sum?

91
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,940
Bring the dough!

92
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,750
If that it is not extortion…

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,310
If you guarantee to me that you will lead it to good port.

94
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,870
You have to only negotiate directly with the Princess. I am certain that it will accept.

95
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,890
Approximately, one must initially save it.

96
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,660
While we speak,
the life of the Princess is…

97
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,140
I included/understood.

98
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,850
One will save your Princess.

99
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,780
Ahead Zoro!!

100
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,340
I do not move me, idiot!

101
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,600
Why will I help you with you to put full the pockets of them?

102
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,470
What a idiotic!

103
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,290
My money, it is my money.

104
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,590
But the agreement concerns you all.

105
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,390
And since when you take this kind of decisions?

106
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,500
What? All that you ace to do it is of going to occupy you of these types.

107
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,770
I do not like to be made use. You ace that to ask your moron of cook to take care some.

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,210
Be to you saying to me

109
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,570
what don't be able for you to beat them?

110
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,800
Do not be to you well?

111
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,210
Repeat that once again to see!

112
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,620
Be to you saying to me

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,220
for how do not be able you to beat them?!
Wee…

114
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,080
And it does it moreover!

115
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,980
You forgot?
You are my debtor!

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,540
About what you speak.

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,010
In Loguetown, you said that you wanted to buy katanas to you, and I lent 100.000 to you Berrys.

118
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,350
But I already refunded them to you!

119
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,270
I had the katanas free, therefore I have anything spent!

120
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,230
However, when you borrowed them to me, you promised to refund me triple.

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,190
I have purchases to make.

122
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,900
I make you a loan, if you refund me triple.

123
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,680
Thus you owe me 200.000 more Berrys.

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,970
But I refunded you immediately after you gave me the money!

125
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:50,590
Too bad…

126
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,390
You are not rotten to even hold a small promise?

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,710
If you do what I ask you, one will be free!

128
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,340
I hope that you will burst in atrocious sufferings!

129
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,280
You ace reason! I will go right in Hell.

130
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,110
Shit! I hate you!

131
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,930
Thank you in advance!

132
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,860
Which humiliation…

133
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,150
If I had been more extremely, I could have protected the Princess myself.

134
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,110
You of made not.

135
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,230
It is very strong, this moron.

136
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,940
The Princess…
If something were to arrive at Vivi-Sama,

137
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,040
it would be finished by it kingdom of Arabasta!

138
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,820
She must live!

139
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,810
Course!

140
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,930
Course, Karu!

141
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,670
It has there a boat anchored behind the Rocks of the Cactus!

142
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,380
Will be used it to flee

143
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,850
and to turn over to Arabasta!

144
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,340
Ca is better!
Go, with the dodo.

145
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
It is what that?

146
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
More quickly, Karu!

147
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,830
Karu, stop!

148
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,200
Mr. 5…

149
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,860
He found us.

150
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,640
Karu, by here!
Quickly!

151
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,210
This escape is vain.

152
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,600
Monday miss!
Flee. The boat is right behind.

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,120
I will retain them.
But…

154
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,180
We will be punished in any event

155
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,280
to have lost vis-a-vis this superhuman swashbuckler.

156
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,500
Therefore,

157
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,450
I prefer to die while being used as shield with a friend.

158
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,550
Do Eh well, what you wait?

159
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,720
If you die,

160
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,530
the sacrifices of Mr. 8 and Mr. 9 will have been vain.

161
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,710
Slip by!

162
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you.

163
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,050
Initially Mr. 9 and then you…

164
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,430
Monday miss.

165
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,620
You will not go further.
I make the oath of it.

166
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,990
It is amusing.

167
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,090
You made me pity…

168
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,230
For Works Baroque!!

169
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,300
You are shame!!

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,440
Monday miss…

171
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Monday miss…

172
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,430
I am able to make explosive any part of my body. I am a human bomb.

173
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,090
Thanks to the capacity of the fruit Boom Boom,
I never failed in any of my missions.

174
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,440
And with the capacities of the fruit Kilo Kilo,
this traitress…

175
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,230
… Monday Miss will be reduced out of pulp.

176
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,420
I am able to change my weight at will.

177
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,100
In this moment, I am enough light to float in the airs.

178
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,490
Look at as I take weight.

179
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,160
Then?

180
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,720
You really think of being able you to leave there?

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,190
You cannot escape to us.

182
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,470
I will survive.
To survive and…

183
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,530
I will survive! And I go…

184
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,240
… to return in Arabasta!

185
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,030
Take that!

186
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,080
Mr. Bushido!

187
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,590
… The passage…

188
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,900
Who it is, this type?

189
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,080
I cut droppings!

190
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,600
Why do you insist like that in one similar moment?

191
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,190
Very soft.
I am there to help you.

192
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,460
To help me?

193
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,040
He…

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,390
It is what with the Juste, Baroque Works?

195
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,200
It is a clandestine criminal organization.

196
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,760
No member knows the name of the Boss, nor did not see his face.

197
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,730
They are specialized in espionage, the murder, the flight and the collecting of the premiums.

198
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,070
All is made according to the orders of the Boss.

199
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,940
But why does everyone obey the orders of a Boss that it forever considering?

200
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,900
Because the final objective of Works Baroque is to found a “Ideal Nation”.

201
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,470
The Boss promised with those which fulfill their missions successfully

202
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:44,150
that they will occupy of the stations - keys in the “Ideal Nation” which it intends to create.

203
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,960
I see.

204
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,350
The code name of the Boss is Mr. 0.

205
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,330
In other words, more code name of the member is close to zero,

206
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,260
more the row which it occupies is high.

207
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,330
They are the most powerful members!

208
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,960
The power of those of which the number is lower than 5 is… phenomenal!

209
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,810
You are not the type which sliced all the inhabitants of this city?

210
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,750
Why do you protect maintaining the Princess from Arabasta?

211
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,510
I have my reasons.

212
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,500
Well, that imports.

213
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,880
In are all the cases, you our enemy, not? Release from there!

214
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,830
Exact! Release!

215
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,280
TE VOILAAA!!

216
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,700
ZOROOOOOO!!!

217
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,670
It is what this time?

218
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,200
Luffy!

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,310
If came to you to help me, it is not the sorrow.

220
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,970
Unless you do not have also debts towards this woman.

221
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,360
YOU WILL NOT DRAW You LIKE CA!!
IN GUARD!

222
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,400
But what do you tell?
MT MOUTH!

223
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,070
Species of dirty ungrateful!
I will explode you the head!

224
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,790
Ungrateful?

225
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,630
Ouais!

226
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,760
Did He, what occur?
Who did that to you?

227
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,610
Your pal… the type with the green sabers and hair.

228
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,730
What?

229
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,230
They had organized a super festival in our honor,

230
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,070
and you you all put them in parts!!
Do not be to you well??

231
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,490
Bah… Ouais, it is true…

232
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,950
I will not forgive it to you!

233
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,220
This type is completely stunned or what?

234
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,930
They are friendly?

235
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,410
Which wounds, these…

236
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,680
Let us kill them. As all those which are put across our way.

237
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,500
He, Luffy.

238
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,910
Listen to me. In fact, it is…

239
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,970
I CARD-INDEX MYSELF YOUR EXCUSES!

240
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,700
What?

241
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,600
You want to kill me?

242
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,740
Ouais! Burst!

243
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,650
Moron! You will listen to me, yes?

244
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,750
Which moron…

245
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,360
He is serious.

246
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,570
Mr. 5?

247
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,260
In fact, one would say that they do not obstruct us, after all.

248
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,560
One would say.

249
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,360
Well, it any more but does not remain us to achieve our mission.

250
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,100
What is summarized to kill the Princess of Arabasta, Vivi.

251
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,130
You will not escape!

252
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,380
Luffy, listens to me!

253
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,270
Ahead, Valentine Miss.

254
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,590
Yes, Mr. 5.

255
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,110
Ca is enough now! MORON!

256
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,660
What a idiotic!

257
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,380
How do you dare to bar us the road?

258
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,840
What was it that?

259
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,080
Since your friend and have you the air to so much want between-to kill you,

260
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,130
I will have a joy of occupying me of you myself.

261
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,330
Not?

262
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,080
Now, I am in detonator!

263
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,400
I will kill you, thanks to the capacities of the fruit Kilo Kilo!

264
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,980
You prepare!

265
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,650
My weight is only of 1 kg, thus I use the blast of the explosion to float!

266
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,650
Mr. Bushido, do not remain there! This woman…

267
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,140
The farm!

268
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,340
I do not have time to lose with it.

269
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,180
A little exercise, that made of the good.

270
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,410
Ca made me digest.

271
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,200
Mr. 5… Not possible!

272
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,150
An Agent Officer of Works Baroque…

273
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,870
One finally will pass to the serious things.

274
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,120
He, Luffy… The calm one and listens to me.
I arriiiive!

275
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,690
The inhabitants of this city are all of the bargain hunters.

276
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:07,030
My capacities enable me to vary my weight from 1 to 10000 kg!

277
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,530
They are our enemies!

278
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,910
You finished being unaware of me??

279
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,420
LIAR! Enemies do not offer meals like that!!

280
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,070
Take that!

281
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,220
Luffy.

282
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,010
It would be said that no matter what I say, that does not return in your dirty caboche.

283
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,760
Species of dark cretin!

284
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,540
In my turn, now, to try to kill you!

285
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,660
Then do not come pleurnicher when I smash you!

286
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,330
Bring back yourself!

287
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,850
Wait… What do you make?

288
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,040
Aren't you friendly both?

289
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,800
Here is an good occasion to see

290
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,110
who of the fist or the saber, is strongest.

291
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,430
He. Let us see what you ace in the belly!

292
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,560
(Tornado)

293
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,550
What do I have to make?
I want to flee but…

294
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,440
I wonder whether I do not risk anything…

295
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,630
Brothel…

296
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,050
These types are well foutus of me.

297
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,550
They sullied the name with the Agents Officers of Works Baroque.

298
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,760
Mr. 5.

299
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,330
Let us show them what we are really able!

300
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,460
Allons-y, Miss Valentine!

301
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,340
Yes, Mr. 5!

302
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,330
We are Agents Officers of Works Baroque!! Then stop to you foutre us!

303
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,590
Close it!

304
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,680
DO NOT DISTURB US!!

305
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,170
DURING OUR COMBAT!!

306
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,920
RELEASE FROM!!!

Dumb!

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,860
While launching this attack, it is me whom you aimed.

193
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,570
Anything.

194
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,540
But if you want to fight, not concern.
I have some enough that you trail in my legs.

195
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,160
What thus?

196
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,500
I was going to say the same thing, salts vegetarian!

197
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,000
He not, I like the meat too.

198
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,130
You would make better turn over to ruminate elsewhere.

199
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,930
I suppose that the confrontation is inevitable.

200
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,050
Very well, then remains here.

201
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,260
I will finish some with the preys.

202
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,100
I do not have any as a a long time.

203
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,060
Wait!

204
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,900
I want well that one fights, but you me leashes the preys.

205
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,310
Very interesting!

206
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,730
Zoro-kun!

207
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,900
Who is strongest according to you, a giraffe or a wolf?

208
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,490
Does that interest you?

209
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,370
Not really.

210
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,580
It is true?

211
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,700
You would like to see them fighting?

212
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,830
Not, I said…

213
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,290
Let make me.

214
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,340
The prognostic one of the largest hunter of pirates,

215
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,340
And of the epeist of the crew of Luffy the pirate is…

216
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,050
Really?

217
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,260
Then you think that the wolf is stronger?

218
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Obviously.

219
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
What thus?

220
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,600
Is the giraffe strong too?

221
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,020
Oh, I see.

222
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,610
The “Amanedachi” of presently was impressive, it is that?

223
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,820
You saw just.

224
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,240
The wolves are crafty ones.

225
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,320
But they are not so strong only that.

226
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,830
Dumb, you irritate me!

227
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,160
You want to fight immediately?

228
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,910
Well, well!

229
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,170
It is our chance, Zoro-kun.

230
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,080
I included/understood.

231
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,590
One will benefit from it while they fight between them.

232
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,590
You want téchapper while they fight?

233
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,220
He! You understand that now?

234
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,510
Does not reveal our plans to them!

235
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,310
You failed to make you have.

236
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,440
The preys have priority.

237
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,020
Zoro-kun!

238
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,980
How you ace which been able to do that?

239
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,530
You come from foutre my plans in the air.

240
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,280
In any event, this plan was not terrible.

241
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,360
Here the plan of survival number two!

242
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,410
Zoro-kun, you do not say anything this time.

243
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,370
A giraffe or a wolf, I wonder who am coolest.

244
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,670
The force is not enough.

245
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,340
Really strong somebody, must have the class and be cool.

246
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,220
Which that could be…

247
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,270
On top, there is no doubt.

248
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,690
What do you want to say?

249
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,190
The wolves are stronger and much more cools.

250
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,690
About what you do speak?

251
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,320
Those which the children in the zoos like more,

252
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,910
Are not the wolves, but the giraffes!

253
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,070
For this reason the giraffes are more cools!

254
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,410
I suspected it, you do not reflect more than one horse.

255
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,370
I am not a horse, I am a giraffe.

256
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,500
It is our chance, Zoro-kun!

257
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,300
This kind of pretense will not last a long time.

258
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,300
Then you have another idea?

259
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,220
[Janken: Japanese Pierre-Sheet-chisel]

260
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,300
One plays “Janken”, Sogeking.

261
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,260
The problem is there.

262
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,890
It is possible to get rid of these shackles.

263
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,270
It is what the relationship with Janken?

264
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,190
That which loses…

265
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,730
… the hand is cut.

266
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,570
How you can say a similar thing?

267
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,200
I did not finish my explanations.

268
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,990
Thus that which will be released…

269
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,500
… will leave with its hand to give it to Chopper…

270
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,380
… and it will be able to fix then.

271
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,710
One is not headstocks!
Would not be stupid!

272
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,800
I have another idea…

273
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,640
I do not want to know!

274
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,220
Let us pass to the serious things.

275
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,640
It is when you want.

276
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,650
Gaining has the preys for him all alone.

277
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,790
What…

278
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,880
Perfect, Sogeking.

279
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,380
Remain quite right.

280
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,760
You are my saber!

281
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,890
I want a lawyer!

282
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,810
One day, I will stick a lawsuit to you!

283
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,900
What will you make, now?

284
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,610
Hurry to deposit me with ground.

285
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,900
Like that, I will be able to you foutre a beating.

286
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,070
Pas la pains to harp.

287
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,660
I will make so that you buckle it good once for all.

288
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,000
Fast ultra spinning top!

289
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,870
TEKKAI DAMA

290
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,330
I will propel you on the lathe by the centrifugal force.

291
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,130
I see…

292
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,800
I will surely not leave there alive.

293
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,800
[Centaur]

294
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,800
FRANKY KENTAUROS

295
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,430
Chapa?

296
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,020
I hold you by the legs.

297
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,020
Like that, you lose any freedom of movement.

298
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,980
How that?

299
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,570
Even if you do that, you cannot
nothing against this centrifugal force.

300
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,490
Not inevitably.

301
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,200
Gauge 70 mm, Canon de Cola 0,2!

302
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,740
Small…

303
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,950
COUP DE VENT

304
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,960
It countered the force!

305
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,330
The spinning top stopped.

306
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,420
Whore!

307
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,290
That is enough!

308
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,500
One is soon on the dry land.

309
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,710
Take-that!

310
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,390
Gauge 70 mm, 1,5 max Power Cola!

311
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,800
COUP DE

312
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,970
You insane what, dumb?

313
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,770
Give up!

314
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,730
COUP DE

315
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,520
VENT

316
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,410
SUPER!

317
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,010
I want to save Robin.

318
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,390
Afflicted, Doctorine.

319
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,100
Soon in One Part: Unverifiable!
Rumble prohibited of Chopper.

320
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,060
I will become the Lord of the pirates!

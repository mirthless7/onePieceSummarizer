1
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:02,883
The going Merry landed in full heart
fortress marinades Navarone

2
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,583
Luffy and its crew hopelessly try to flee this place.

3
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,383
Nami was disguised in femme de ménage.

4
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:19,883
Luffy and Sanji were made pass for
cooks in a refectory.

5
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,350
But…

6
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,083
at the same time, Zoro was made stop.

7
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:30,283
Welcome with Navarone.

8
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:38,783
The URGENT OPERATION
ZORO AND CHOPPER!

9
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,083
Humm….

10
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:46,550
L remains about it still six.

11
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,550
Roronoa Zoro of the crew of the Straw hat.

12
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:54,882
Drake, did you question it?

13
00:02:54,883 --> 00:03:00,015
But… Commander, you had asked me
meanwhile to check the refectory.

14
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:01,815
Hum, really?

15
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:05,850
You wanted to know who had
joined the refectory, yesterday evening.

16
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,950
Hum… I will throw
a glance myself.

17
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,816
Jessica spoke to me about two
new recruits in kitchen.

18
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,883
On which subject do have I to question Zoro?

19
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,683
Made as you want.

20
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:35,616
Whore! It is what all this world?

21
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:54,483
Bah… I would make better rest me.

22
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,816
Open the door.

23
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:03,550
Yes, Major Drake!

24
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,549
But this type is dangerous.

25
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,749
It is an order of the Jonason general.

26
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,015
Now let question Roronoa Zoro to me!

27
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,283
Yes, made attention.

28
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,550
Roronoa Zoro.

29
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,349
You were regarded as a hunter of pirates…

30
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,482
Now you belong to
the crew of the Straw hat.

31
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:29,416
What? Only came to you to say that to me?

32
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,482
Of or do you come?

33
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,082
How much are you?

34
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,083
Which are your intentions in
penetrating the fortress?

35
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,615
It is a good strategy to have
unloaded in our fortress of the sky.

36
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:41,549
How did you make?

37
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,882
Which kind of process did you use?

38
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,415
Ah, that, eh well… one comes from the sky!

39
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,015
Decree to say conneries!

40
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:51,083
They are not conneries.
One really came from the sky.

41
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:54,015
I am not here to listen to your lies!

42
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,215
I explain you…

43
00:04:55,216 --> 00:05:00,083
one came from the sky by using an octopus
montgolfier… And one flew up to now.

44
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:01,816
You measuring rods?

45
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:06,083
You persist in saying anything!

46
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,150
Do not take the Navy not with the light one!

47
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,350
I will make you acknowledge costs whom costs!

48
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,082
Now you are in load of this place.

49
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,616
Yes, I included/understood.

50
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,883
What, it is that…

51
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:50,216
All that… for me only?

52
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:58,150
If you clean all that completely,
you will be entitled to the breakfast.

53
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:03,616
I should never have disguised me kind.

54
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,349
I intended to say that they put the hook on one
member of the crew of Straw hat.

55
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,215
What? Those of the famous ghost ship?

56
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,882
Ouais, but one deals with worse than phantom…

57
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:18,350
It is not other than the démoniaque one…
hunter of pirates, Roronoa Zoro!

58
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,549
L must also there have his/her companions here.

59
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,949
That would be although one discovers one as of theirs!

60
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,350
O-Oh!

61
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:28,815
Zoro got caught.

62
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:30,883
What does one have to make?

63
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,815
According to what they said, others
must be healthy and safe.

64
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:42,082
Shit, one must escape from here as quickly as possible!

65
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,550
I do not know or are the different ones, and
I do not know how to find them!

66
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,816
It is what that?

67
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:53,283
At this rate/rhythm, I will fall from tiredness
before even as they catch me.

68
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,483
Decree!!!

69
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,482
With the help!!!

70
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,816
Decree!!!

71
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,150
That was not for me.

72
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,816
But I would make well disguise me as someone else.

73
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,683
Here.

74
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,149
No the chance I am wedged!

75
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,883
Chive is by there!

76
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,749
Yosh! It left for hunting to chive!

77
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,683
But this hunting is prohibited!

78
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,616
How to make? How to make?

79
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:33,549
It disappeared.

80
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,682
It was well a chive.

81
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,483
It is not any more.

82
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,950
By here.

83
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,616
That is likely to be difficult to find it now.

84
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:07,350
Go.

85
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,215
It is what that?

86
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:14,215
Who could well put these horns, there?!

87
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,682
Will know…

88
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,683
In any event, there is nothing to draw some from these horns.

89
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,350
Fact of shitting! One failed to have it.

90
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,416
I am saved…

91
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:35,083
Good… Or are they?

92
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,016
Surely by there.

93
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,615
Ah, that must be that.

94
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:41,149
What they intend to make
with these horns of stag?

95
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,383
They use them for medicine.

96
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,350
What did it occur?

97
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,282
A storm was wiped…
and there were many casualties.

98
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,282
You dispatch!

99
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,350
Take them along to the infirmary!

100
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:04,615
At this time, insert the scalpel vertically.

101
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:06,550
After the flow of blood…

102
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,550
Blood…

103
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,150
Blood… Blood…

104
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,483
Blood… Blood… Blood…

105
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:33,215
Good blood, why all doctors
on mission are parties…?

106
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:36,015
My God, please, made in kind
that there is no casualty to look after.

107
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,215
Doctor!

108
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:38,150
Yes.

109
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:42,083
The horns of stag were brought back to you.

110
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,682
What, for the moment place them here, thank you.

111
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,083
Included/understood.

112
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:52,216
Or am I?

113
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,949
That suits me to wonder.

114
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,816
Now I do not have anything any more to fear.

115
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,750
Afflicted!

116
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,815
What do you tell?

117
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:12,683
Hurry of going to the infirmary!

118
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:16,950
It is an urgency! All them
nurses are convened!

119
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,083
Definitely, that did not serve anything that I disguise myself!

120
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,750
Doctor Kobato!
There is an urgency!

121
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,483
It is for médecine générale,
pediatry or…

122
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:29,149
That concerns the men of Stanberry.
The majority of them are wounded.

123
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,882
Chi-surgery… I let to you occupy myself some…

124
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,816
The surgery is not my field.

125
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,882
What do you tell?

126
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:39,416
For the moment on the base, you summers only the doctor!

127
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:45,283
Wait a little! I know nothing in surgery there!
I am specialized in pediatry….

128
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,215
I see, it acts of the infirmary.

129
00:10:51,216 --> 00:10:54,050
This doctor will he succeed in leaving itself there?

130
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:08,050
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

131
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,150
One,

132
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,883
One, two,

133
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:10,950
One, two, three.

134
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,549
That was to be very violent.

135
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,016
That was to surely be a tropical cyclone.

136
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,216
Hold, hurries to go to look after the casualties!

137
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,283
Yes!

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,450
I still type myself the dirty job, I must
to find Going Merry as fast as possible…

139
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,083
to flee this place, but
I am always wedged here…

140
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,082
D-sorry…

141
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,017
Pay attention!

142
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,750
Doctor, whom do we have to make?

143
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,416
Euh yes, yes…

144
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:47,483
Inject to them fifty milligrams of anodyne.

145
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:49,150
And in connection with the bloc opératoire?

146
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,950
Aperture…

147
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,882
Aperture… Opera…

148
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:52,217
Aperture… Opera… Operation.

149
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,683
Doctor! Doctor!

150
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,016
Doctor, hold good!
Do not fall into apples!

151
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,350
Please, give us the instructions to be followed!

152
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,583
Oh Doctor!

153
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,150
I must do it.

154
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,750
You all, want to follow my instructions!

155
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,482
To inject first of all
the acid forint and cardiotonic with the patient!

156
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:23,217
One will need also Aldehyde-2!

157
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:26,682
You included/understood?!

158
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:27,617
Yes!

159
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,083
Prepare blood testings and
also synodicaux serums!

160
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,550
So patients need one
operation, prepare them for!

161
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:45,149
This patient needs a reduction
of its ignition!

162
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,083
Yes!

163
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,350
Summers you ready?

164
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,682
Your order is awaited!

165
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:52,482
Well, one will start with the most serious casualties!

166
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:53,350
Yes!

167
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,749
Hold good, Doctor.

168
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,882
Chopper!

169
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:10,416
Are Nami, why to you?

170
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,350
And you then?!

171
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,150
How are held the events?

172
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,383
I had small a faintness at the moment.

173
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,017
You must be a doctor?

174
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,016
Although I do not know whom you summers…

175
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:27,283
I would like to thank you to have to us
provided invaluable indications.

176
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,150
It is not finished yet!

177
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:34,617
L still has soldiers there very seriously
touched which needs an operation!

178
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,816
Yes!

179
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:37,349
There are not time to lose!

180
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,282
Operate most seriously wounded immediately!

181
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,617
Yes! Opér…

182
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,083
What is there?

183
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,817
J I cannot do that.

184
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,416
Why?

185
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:55,482
I do not support nor the pain
others nor sight of blood.

186
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:58,549
I feel very badly when I make injections…

187
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,882
And by opening their body then by withdrawing their bowels…

188
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,016
This kind of medicine is exceeded!

189
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,149
This is not a base of the Navy here?!

190
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,350
How you made to look after
people before?

191
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:12,482
I am specialized in pediatry.

192
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,282
All the other doctors are on mission.

193
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:18,350
And they left me here as
person in charge of the infirmary.

194
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,549
Person in charge?

195
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,483
It does not matter the fact of being responsible or not!
You are the leader of the infirmary!

196
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:27,749
Yes, to some extent.

197
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,617
Chopper, one must leave from here as fast as possible.

198
00:14:30,817 --> 00:14:31,816
But…

199
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:36,417
One must leave! It is not a lake, it is connected to the sea.

200
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,667
One can leave from here with Merry.

201
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,617
One cannot now!

202
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:44,683
You are doctor!

203
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:51,683
It is quite true but… a doctor cannot do everything.

204
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:56,617
My professor had taught me that,

205
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,749
Once, a man did not can find of doctor…

206
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,416
and did not can thus acquire remedy for its disease.

207
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,350
Then it decided to join the place
where he wanted to die…

208
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,417
But while crossing a mountain,
he found cherry trees in flowers!

209
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,882
Then this man consulted another doctor,

210
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,816
who says to him…

211
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,217
you summers in good health.

212
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,016
For all the patients present here,

213
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,949
you summers the single doctor.

214
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,550
You summers the only one with being able to save them!

215
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,216
You cannot give up.

216
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,750
It is not a terminal illness in question.

217
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,283
It is not a thing impossible to surmount.

218
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:41,750
There is no patient here whom one cannot cure!

219
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:48,683
The doctors make miracles!
And one must believe in it!

220
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,617
Euh…

221
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:56,016
Could I see…

222
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:59,549
these cherry trees in flowers?

223
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,682
Not!

224
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:02,482
Can I show with the patient…

225
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,949
these cherry trees in flowers?

226
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,549
You can it!

227
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,682
And I will help you there!

228
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:08,816
Have-await!

229
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,083
There are not time for that!

230
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,883
It does not matter.

231
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,817
For me, a life is more important than all!

232
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,350
Because I am doctor!

233
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:23,350
Since it is like that,
I any more will not worry for you. Does that suit you?

234
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,483
Doctor, the bloc opératoire is ready!

235
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,216
Very well, I arrive immediately!

236
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,683
Tankard… Doctor…

237
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,017
I included/understood!

238
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:46,617
Chopper!

239
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,417
You should not any more worry you for me,

240
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,082
if I gave up it now,

241
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,350
Doctorine would be very furious!

242
00:16:56,283 --> 00:17:00,217
Good blood, how could I give up you?!

243
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:25,883
There is this kind of doctor?

244
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:31,150
Beginning of the operation.

245
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,016
It has a fragment in the body.

246
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:34,617
One must operate it.

247
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:37,816
The patient was anaesthetized.

248
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:38,616
Scalpel.

249
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:39,483
Yes, Doctor.

250
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:47,217
Doctor Kobato, all will be well.

251
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,083
He will be able to see the cherry trees in flowers, thanks to you.

252
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:52,283
Yes.

253
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,617
Here one is very close to one to
its arteries, made attention.

254
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:01,750
Yes.

255
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,349
Nami, pompe aspirante.

256
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,550
Yes.

257
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,417
The fragment is withdrawn.

258
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,282
Super.

259
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:22,416
It is not the moment for the congratulations.

260
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,149
One has still full with patients.

261
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,883
Yes.

262
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,350
Good courage.

263
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,017
Yes.

264
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,682
What? You never saw these doctors!

265
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:33,950
Yes!

266
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,350
It must surely be a question members
of the crew of the Straw hat.

267
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,083
Excuse me!

268
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,417
We operate, want to leave.

269
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:48,149
It is urgent!

270
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,349
Doctor Kobato.

271
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,217
I would like to speak to you about something.

272
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,150
Doctor Kobato, the blood pressure of the patient falls!

273
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,283
Prepare a perfusion for the patient!

274
00:18:59,283 --> 00:18:59,817
Yes!

275
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,216
They is good, continue the transfusion like that.

276
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:05,683
Prepare also the serum.

277
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:09,082
Humm, Doctor Kobato.

278
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,216
I have a delicate operation, in this moment-even.

279
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,216
You calm.

280
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,549
I would like to know, Doctor.

281
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,417
Usually you summers frightened with the sight of blood
isn't this Doctor?

282
00:19:19,883 --> 00:19:22,549
One seeks funny of doctor.

283
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,183
You disturb me!

00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:26,882
Here there is only…

285
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:31,417
doctors and nurses, who make
better qu they can to save lives!

286
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,483
Let us leave from here!

287
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,949
Remain here.

288
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,482
Yes!

289
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,483
It is finally finished.

290
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,483
Doctor, this patient was the last.

291
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,617
Congratulations, Doctor Kobato.

292
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,883
Cho… Chopper!

293
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,083
Doctor Kobato is very gifted.

294
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,949
That pleases to me.

295
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,816
Mr. Chive is, him also,
a very good doctor.

296
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,749
What do you tell?

297
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,983
I am not a chive, I am a reindeer.

298
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,000
She had uncovered it since the beginning,
even under its disguise!

299
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:44,017
Am whore, what I manufacturing here?

300
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,217

00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:53,482
Ah, but I can nothing refuse in Jessica-san.

00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:08,082
Why one must escape from here?

309
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,016
All that it is because of your conneries.

310
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:12,416
Say, Sanji.

311
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,082

00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,150
You want to cook octopus.

313
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,950
Stop saying anything.

314
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,750
Then? You finished?

315
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:22,882
One will not be able to nourish thousand soldiers
if you do not hurry.

316
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,616
Oi, Jessica-swan!

317

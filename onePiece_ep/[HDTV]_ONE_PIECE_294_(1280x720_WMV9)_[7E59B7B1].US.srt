1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Say a spell in your chest

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,829
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

Kasoku shita yokan

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Nanairo no onpukana de

Issho ni konai ka?

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
Bokura datenshi

Shuuru na datenshi

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,990
Kokoro kara utau no sa

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,609
Wealth.

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,919
Fame.

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,980
Power.

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,679
The man who once owned everything,

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,759
The Pirate King,

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,230
Gold Roger.

40
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,049
The words he said before his death

41
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,039
sent all the people of the world

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,069
out to the seas.

43
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,120
My treasure?

44
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,249
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,890
Find it!

46
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,000
I left everything in that place.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,649
Men, searching for romance,

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,800
pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

49
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,279
The world is now

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,490
in the Grand Age of Pirates!

51
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,420
Rankyaku "Renge": Storm leg "lotus blossom"

52
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,330
Take this!

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,490
Yana Gin Jou: Emotional song of the willows

54
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,390
What...

55
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,870
...is this?

56
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,380
A voice.

57
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,929
Oi, hurry up...

58
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,200
Why're you stopping, Nico Robin?!

59
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,969
Oi, did you hear me?!

60
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,340
You woman whose mere existence is a crime!

61
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,859
Oi, Lucci, drag her along!

62
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,940
Grab her by the hair!

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,590
It's an order.

64
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,890
Keep moving.

65
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,230
Nico Robin.

66
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,879
Wait...

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,560
Do you actually still think the Strawhat crew's gonna come to save you?

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,940
Idiot!

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,530
Do you really believe in those lousy pirates?

70
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,590
The only thing you'll ever feel will be the pain of your sins.

71
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,850
You'll continue to pay for the sin of living until this day!

72
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,209
Right?

73
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,180
Nico Robin?

74
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,670
ROBIN!

75
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,539
W-what was that?!

76
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,050
I heard a voice!

77
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,860
What was that voice?!

78
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,770
It got really wide! Where am I?

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,750
I found you, pigeon-guy!

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,430
Resounding Bad News!

81
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,240
The Buster Call Invoked!

82
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,710
Let me congratulate you

83
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,460
On making it this far

84
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,280
All alone.

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,210
I'm not alone.

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,310
I didn't come alone.

87
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,510
I wouldn't want to come alone.

88
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,640
I'm different from you guys, I'm not alone!

89
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,250
All of my nakama are gonna make it here!

90
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,780
Rankyaku!

91
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,400
Soru!

92
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,430
I finally got the hang of this.

93
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,230
I'm getting dizzy...

94
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,790
Sailors shouldn't talk like that!

95
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,660
I'm not a sailor, I'm a hero from Sniper Island!

96
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,989
My friend Usopp-kun is a sailor, but-

97
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,160
Don't talk about stupid stuff.

98
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,579
You dodged?

99
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,269
This is bad!

100
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,740
Prepare yourself.

101
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,039
Got it!

102
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,900
And don't do anything stupid.

103
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,650
Got it!

104
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,059
No wait, I'm gonna die!

105
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,940
You're gonna kill me!

106
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,810
It's no good...

107
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,229
I'm all slippery, so I can't stand up...

108
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,840
Anyway,

109
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,260
That's a pretty weird ability.

110
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,330
I'll only lose if you can break through it.

111
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,540
In both strength and beauty, you'll never be able to catch up to me.

112
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,759
I gave you a present of beautiful, smooth skin.

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,480
You should be grateful.

114
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,980
Oh, yes, thank you.

115
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,490
But...

116
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,000
Isn't there a limit to it?

117
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,490
Are there limits to a woman's desire?

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,369
Wait, then do it to yourself!

119
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,190
Oh, I don't need to.

120
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,649
I'm already beautiful enough.

121
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,489
Woah, she's weird.

122
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,710
What?

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,410
Nothing.

124
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,950
Just you wait...

125
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm gonna launch my counter-attack.

126
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,229
Ow ow ow...

127
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,529
Damn that deer-gorilla...

128
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,050
I guess I underestimated him...

129
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,909
But more importantly, I need to get the key.

130
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,690
If I don't get to that secretary soon, then...

131
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,210
Deer-gorilla! Wait a second, you!

132
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,219
All available troops, report to the front of the courthouse!

133
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,490
This is urgent!

134
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,529
Don't falter!

135
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,559
Capture the traitors!

136
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,269
Traitors?

137
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,900
Don't make me laugh...

138
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,459
The one who betrayed us...

139
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,980
Was you marines!

140
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,750
Besides, we're pirates!

141
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,140
What's wrong with pirates fighting marines?

142
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,439
Let's go, Oimo!

143
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,430
Okay, Karsee!

144
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,549
We need to keep firing on them!

145
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,100
Firing squad, concentrate your fire on Karsee!

146
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,699
Now!

147
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,150
Get him!

148
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,149
We can't lose now!

149
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,850
Go!

150
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,140
Oi, Karsee!

151
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,819
Next is Oimo!

152
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,490
Shoot him down!

153
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,779
Looks like something happened outside.

154
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,109
The giants tried hard, but...

155
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,090
Did they reach their limit?

156
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,020
Oi...

157
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Oi, hurry up, you!

158
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,589
Damn, this is bad.

159
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,740
The pirates shouldn't have gotten this far!

160
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,239
Oi!

161
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,459
Everyone respond!

162
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,629
CP9!

163
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,729
What the hell're you guys doing?!

164
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,040
One of the pirates made it in here!

165
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,519
Oi, are you listening?

166
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Answer me already!

167
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,230
Wait!

168
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,050
You... that's...!

169
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,990
Go-Go-Golden Denden Mushi!

170
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,660
The Silver Denden Mushi has received a signal!

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,109
A Buster Call has been requested!

172
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,750
A Buster Call has been requested by Admiral Aokiji!

173
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,169
Where?

174
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,560
Enies Lobby.

175
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,870
Call the five Vice-Admirals nearest to our destination.

176
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,999
At this distance, it's quickest to leave from the headquarters.

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,220
How long?

178
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,320
We can arrive in 30 minutes.

179
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Prepare ten battleships immediately.

180
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,480
Call in five Vice-Admirals.

181
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,879
Quickly!

182
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,620
Yes sir!

183
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,430
A Buster Call has been requested!

184
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,770
Our destination is Enies Lobby!

185
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,110
Prepare ten battleships immediately!

186
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,570
Oi! Oi!

187
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,139
Yes, Director?

188
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,349
Dammit, this is the hand with the little Denden Mushi...

189
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,850
Damn, I was too careless.

190
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,280
Why'd I have to push the Golden Denden Mushi?

191
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,480
And I just had...

192
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,150
To call the Buster Call!

193
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,860
And I just had...

194
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,280
To call the Buster Call!

195
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,429
B-Buster Call? That can't be...

196
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,360
What is this, an announcement?

197
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,960
How could you...

198
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,220
Stop it immediately!

199
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,870
That's Robin's voice!

200
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,910
Things are going to get very bad!

201
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,480
Robin!

202
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,589
What?

203
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,510
"Stop it?"

204
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,210
Oi oi, who the hell do you think you're talking to?

205
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,300
What's that conversation?

206
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,629
Oi, don't move!

207
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,290
WE CAN'T!

208
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,639
Isn't a Buster Call great?

209
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,520
What's wrong with it?

210
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,230
That's Director Spandam's voice, right?

211
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,810
Yeah...

212
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,540
This is fine.

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,020
I'm the Director of Cipher Pol No. 9.

214
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,420
I called the Buster Call to deliver you to the government safely.

215
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,470
Yeah, that's great!

216
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,559
But no matter what happens...

217
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,410
First, we have to make sure that all the pirates are dead!

218
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,020
But that's...

219
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,880
Didn't I tell you?!

220
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,800
That isn't all!

221
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,340
That attack doesn't have any humanity!

222
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,880
The Director and...

223
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,220
Who's that woman?

224
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,790
Everything in Enies Lobby will go up in flames!

225
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,659
The buildings, the people...

226
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,310
Even the island itself...!

227
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,149
A nightmarish attack, sacrificing anything to achieve its goal...

228
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,080
That's the Buster Call!

229
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,820
You have no idea what happened on Ohara 20 years ago!

230
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,500
Oh, that's fine.

231
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,510
The government doesn't care.

232
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,540
After that idiotic Cutty Flam burned the Pluton blueprints...

233
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,810
You're the only clue we have to the ancient weapons.

234
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,370
Enough military force to overturn this entire era is coming this way.

235
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,940
In order to completely destroy those idiots who insist on taking you away,

236
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,160
It doesn't matter how many thousands of soldiers die.

237
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,640
It's all a necessary sacrifice for a glorious future!

238
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,000
And most importantly, I'll get my promotion.

239
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,629
What's he talking about?!

240
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,630
Sacrifice us? He's gotta be kidding!

241
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,229
What do you think people's lives are?!

242
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,009
Don't forget,

243
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,199
CP9 are the government's assassins.

244
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,840
If it's necessary for 100 people to die in order to save 1000,

245
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,600
Then we'll immediately go and kill those 100.

246
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,490
Being heartless is necessary for true justice.

247
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,579
Anyway, worthless soldiers that can't even stop those pirates that broke in

248
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,660
Are better off dead anyway, idiot!

249
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,069
That Denden Mushi...

250
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,200
It's still on.

251
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,559
Shit!

252
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,650
That whole conversation went through?!

253
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,609
U-um, well, my name is Strawhat Luffy...

254
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,380
LIAR!

255
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,380
Everyone, leave the island!

256
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,220
A Buster Call is headed towards Enies Lobby!

257
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,049
Nobody on the island will be safe!

258
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,630
Don't say those things!

259
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,540
A Buster Call...

260
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,500
It sounds like a Buster Call is coming.

261
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,470
What's that guy doing...?

262
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,490
Well, it sounds like we're in danger.

263
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,590
I'M THE ONE IN DANGER!

264
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,979
Well, that's too bad.

265
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,220
It seems you have no more chances.

266
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,120
Don't worry.

267
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,080
We're used to this kinda thing.

268
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,559
Pirate kid,

269
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,760
What kinda star were you born under?

270
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,690
Things're getting even more interesting!

271
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,690
A Buster Call was called!

272
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,320
Battleships are coming!

273
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,550
Get outta Enies Lobby!

274
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,019
Why are they running away from battleships?

275
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,459
They said the island was gonna go up in flames.

276
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,209
But this is the government's island!

277
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,099
You think I don't know that?!

278
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,830
Oi, if you guys are running, untie us first!

279
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,319
It's the Buster Call!

280
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,319
If we stay here, we'll die!

281
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,149
Bring the ships to the main gate!

282
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,319
Prepare to sail!

283
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,339
The Marines...

284
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,100
Are coming to attack!

285
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,330
They left us behind...

286
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,249
Oi, what're we gonna do?!

287
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,939
Aren't we in danger?!

288
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,239
We've been in danger ever since we came here.

289
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,420
And Aniki? How's Franky-aniki?

290
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,829
Yeah, if he doesn't come back, we can't go home with him!

291
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,600
Same with the Strawhats!

292
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,030
Then, what's gonna happen?

293
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,470
What's happened to everyone?!

294
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,040
We need to hurry too.

295
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,070
We should clean this up fast, then head to the Gate of Justice.

296
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,699
I've got it.

297
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,349
What?

298
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,849
What did you get?

299
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,479
A way to get off the handcuffs?

300
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,519
A way to get out of here?

301
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,190
You are...

302
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,189
Hana-Arashi: Nose-Storm

303
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,590
This isn't the time for that!

304
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,009
CHOPPER!

305
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,510
Aren't you done yet?!

306
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,220
Saying such annoying things...

307
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,330
If the pirates really did run away,

308
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,700
How, exactly...

309
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,880
Would you pay for it?

310
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,100
What was that?

311
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,930
Where was Robin talking from?

312
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,270
The other side of this door.

313
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,620
I'm not going to let you through.

314
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,300
Move.

315
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,670
Robin's gotta be through that door!

316
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,090
She's there.

317
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,790
You're not seeing her.

318
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,970
Ever again.

319
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,420
No.

320
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm gonna go see her!

321
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,150
I'm going now!

322
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,110
Robin!

323
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,250
What's this?

324
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,789
My whole body is...

325
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,400
I'm sorry.

326
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,489
Since the Buster Call was called, our playtime is over.

327
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,520
Rankyaku!

328
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,349
A-a fake?

329
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,559
Mirage Tempo.

330
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,190
I'm over here!

331
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,709
Next time on One Piece:

332
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,950
Five Namis?

333
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,079
The Counter-Attack is With the Mirage!

334
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,330
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

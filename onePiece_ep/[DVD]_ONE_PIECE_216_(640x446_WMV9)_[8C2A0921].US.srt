1
00:01:53,875 --> 00:02:00,008
Luffy accepted a new part of
Davy Back Fight against L crew of Foxy.

2
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,342
When there remained nothing any more but Luffy,
it was made attack of all shares.

3
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,874
Luffy with the straw hat… expelled!

4
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,075
Shit!

5
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,808
And the winner of the “Hit and Deadball” is…

6
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:29,075
The crew of Foxy!!

7
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:38,475
FINAL MATCH!
DARUMA-SAN GA KORONDA!

8
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:43,474
It is thus the crew of Foxy which
the first test gained!

9
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,608
It is not really a surprise, hein?

10
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,741
The team of the straw hat will lose one as of his!

11
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:50,142
It is in Oyabin to decide.

12
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,341
Of course, I will choose…

13
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:54,675
Please, brings back for us Choppy, Oyabin!

14
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,409
You!

15
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,675
The historian Nico Robin!

16
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:04,608
Me?

17
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,942
Our captain decided to take Nico Robin!

18
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:11,542
A wise decision.

19
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:15,342
Iyan Oyabin, why not have taken Choppy?

20
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:18,341
It is too dangerous, like adversary.

21
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:22,941
If we take it in the crew,
the victory will be simpler.

22
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:23,608
But…

23
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,408
With the next victory, you can be
sure how Dr. Chopper will be ours!

24
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,875
I see! You are formidable Oyabin!

25
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:33,274
Robin!

26
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:33,941
Robin-chan!
Robin!

27
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:35,142
Robin-chan!

28
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,275
With more.

29
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,574
I include/understand with which point that must
to tear to leave us…

30
00:03:43,575 --> 00:03:45,874
and to be separate of me!

31
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:50,274
I know well that it is the rule… but to see Robin-chan
to join this crew, it is unbearable!

32
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,542
Robin!!

33
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,541
Does that suit me well?

34
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,008
Superb! Superb!

35
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,608
It is splendid, my pretty brown.

36
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,608
I always wanted you in our crew.

37
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,942
Iyan… it is very popular…

38
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:09,309
It would be said that Robin was well integrated…

39
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:12,274
I never trusted him in any event…

40
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:16,009
But what takes to you? Robin has faith in us!

41
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:16,942
It is obvious.

42
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,475
Nami-san is right entirely.

43
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:23,409
With the next test, I will overcome them
and will save Robin-chan of their claws.

44
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,341
Dispatch we to gain!

45
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:30,474
Luffy, like you participles with the third test,
you cannot take part in this one.

46
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,708
At least try to retain the rules…

47
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,874
I see. I will encourage you then.

48
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,609
But tries to include/understand, one is only five.

49
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:44,074
The team of the straw hat, not only
you are nothing any more but five to play,

50
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:50,342
but moreover, the loss of Robin weakens you!
You deserved it well! Good, allons-y.

51
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,741
The second test will take place on this long reef,

52
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:04,874
it will be Dodge, Touch & Daruma-san,
also called “DTD”!

53
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,341
That is played six normally but…

54
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:11,009
like they miss Nico Robin, only five members
of the crew of the straw hat will take part.

55
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,808
The rules are simple…

56
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:16,741
When the meter finishes saying “Daruma-san ga koronda”

57
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:20,275
those which he will see moving will be eliminated!

58
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:25,474
The first player who will succeed in touching
the meter will save its team.

59
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,674
But attention, one is not any more with the recreation!

60
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:31,274
It is a set of pirates, you risk
to have serious difficultieies!

61
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,908
The weapons, the guns, all is authorized.

62
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,875
The DTD is a play between the life and death!

63
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,541
Here the “not very impressive” team of the straw hat.

64
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,942
Card-index to us peace!

65
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:48,142
The team of Foxy is composed of our
idol Porch-chan, of Hamburger…

66
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:50,942
I will be able to give the hand on Choppy!

67
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:56,608
As well as Chiqicheetah the sprinter,
and of Kabouti the man-fish…

68
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:59,208
Straight come from Groggy Boxing ring…

69
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:02,742
Pickles Tackle and the giant man-fish Big Bang!

70
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,742
They will pay to have dared to humiliate us!

71
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,475
They are six and train the very powerful team of Foxy!

72
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:17,475
What bait which it makes ichi the fieux one with the échaches?

73
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:22,274
I forgot to present the meter to you…
It will be this time about indigenous… Tonjit!

74
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:27,874
This idiot lived during ten years on
stilts so high that it any more was not seen!

75
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,542
Tonjit is the perfect candidate to become meter.

76
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,409
Altitude gives me the giddiness.

77
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,874
Await, if it is Ossan the meter,

78
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,474
this DTD could turn to our advantage!

79
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:41,975
Which name of weak play…

80
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:45,742
But Usopp tells truth, we are favoured.

81
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,542
You are sure you, Oyabin?

82
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:56,542
My men fought on all the seas
sphere, it is not that which will stop them!

83
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,742
But what a man!

84
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,942
What you ace said, large bacon?

85
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:07,675
There is not the side of the most difficult reef, by chance?!

86
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:15,074
Was necessary to expect it with this beam for conneries…

87
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:15,974
Empaillé fox…

88
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,275
Head of puzzle…

89
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,209
Beam with conneries?

90
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,942
Empaillé fox?!

91
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,141
Head of puzzle?!!

92
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,542
Oyabin!

93
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:26,409
You are rather sensitive, Oyabin?

94
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:32,675
Before starting, in accordance with the rule
DTD, each team must advance of a step.

95
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,542
One advances of a step!

96
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:39,542
Oh, the team of Foxy took a step of giant!

97
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,542
These…

98
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,541
It is enough to follow the plan…

99
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,009
Fight!

100
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,741
I imagine that you suspect it,

101
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:52,342
one should not especially too precipitate.

102
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:56,341
With these cliffs, one would be likely to fall.

103
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,209
And the enemy will not fail to attack us.

104
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:00,341
Head of puzzle!

105
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:03,641
I will not allow myself to disturb the play!

106
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,242
Head of…

107
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,409
Even without my assistance, they will gain without problem!

108
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,009
Meter, are you ready?

109
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,074
Hmmm…

110
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,542
It left!

111
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,542
Go!

112
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:22,941
After the victory of the crew of
Foxy in the first test,

113
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:25,941
it is the hour of Dodge, Touch & Daruma-san!

114
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,074
LOANS!

115
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,542
LEAVE!!

116
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,009
Daaaaa…

117
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,275
Go, Hamburger!

118
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,574
Chiqicheetah leaps ahead!

119
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:43,542
In second position, Hamburger slips by to any pace!

120
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:47,074
At the head of the team of the straw hat,
one finds Roronoa and Sanji.

121
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:48,541
You embarrassments the passage!

122
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,274
Similar for you!

123
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,741
It is really not the moment to fight!

124
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,141
Stop that, Sanji-kun! Zoro!

125
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,209
It is true! Sanji-kun! Zoro!

126
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,142
They are fantastic!

127
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:03,275
aaaaaaaaaaaa…

128
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:08,941
Aaaaaaaaa… I do not manage to accept that the old man
stilts can retain its breathing so a long time!

129
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,608
This role suits him to charm.

130
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:14,374
Ruma-san, gaaaaaaaa….

131
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,808
Imbecile to coil with two pennies!

132
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:19,609
Species of dirty mug of alga!

133
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,074
Is necessary to be wary of these deux-là.

134
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:25,942
The instructions, remove we follow from them initially.

135
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,475
In you, Big Bang!

136
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:38,774
They are in danger!

137
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:40,341
The old one almost finished!

138
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:42,609
These types do not have of it anything with foutre old man!

139
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:45,209
Kooooooo…

140
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,342
rooooooo nnnnnn… da!

141
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,342
Stop!

142
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,209
If one moves, one is eliminated!

143
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,409
Eliminated!

144
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:24,874
Pickles and Big Bang of the team of Foxy,

145
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,275
are eliminated very early in the play!

146
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:30,074
Played well, Zoro and Sanji!

147
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:31,808
No the problem, not of problem!

148
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:37,009
Only one of our players will be enough amply
to touch the meter.

149
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:41,674
Chiqicheetah, Porch and Hamburger largely carry out.

150
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,741
Will the team of the straw hat be able to gain?

151
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:48,142
Iyan, it will be an easy victory!

152
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,674
They are too much fast!

153
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:54,208
Zoro and Sanji are our only hopes, but…

154
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,141
Species of dirty marimo!

155
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:57,875
Perverse cook!

156
00:10:58,142 --> 00:11:02,474
He is of my duty to save my invaluable Robin-chan.

157
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:03,574
I do not have time to lose with you.

158
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:06,808
Daaaaaaa…
I do not have time to lose with you.

159
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,541
Daaaaaaa…
Wait, salts swashbuckler from my two!

160
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:11,475
Daaaaaaa…

161
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,174
Even with two players in less,

162
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:17,541
the team of Foxy always has a gigantic advance!

163
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:21,742
This rate/rhythm, the team of the straw hat
soon any more no chance will have!

164
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,609
Go! Go!

165
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:28,609
Continue like that, continue like that!

166
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:36,919
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

167
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:44,342
MUGIWARA-TEAM

168
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,742
aaaaaaaaa…

169
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:53,475
Shit! Because of you, one took
delay, foutu Marimo!

170
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:59,009
Why there more road has?!

171
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:02,674
But how it is possible to have
a similar direction of the orientation!?

172
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:06,542
How you can paumer then
what the road is right in front of you!?

173
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,742
If I pass by these rocks, I will be able to catch up with them.

174
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,009
That passes or that breaks…

175
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,942
Sanji takes a short cut above the rocks.

176
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,374
Sanji won its bet!

177
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,141
It is found just behind the trinity!

178
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:36,609
Iyan… It is unjust, more quickly, Hamburger!

179
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,075
Qu- what?

180
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:45,074
The less there will be adversaries, and the better it will be.

181
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,608
I will send all the three in hell to you!

182
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:48,942
The Help!!

183
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,074
Nami, Usopp!

184
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:52,475
There are not the choice…

185
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:54,874
Beat a retreat!

186
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,009
With your orders!

187
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,209
You will not be able to escape to me!

188
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,541
Naaaaaaan!

189
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,009
Stop!
Naaaaaaan!

190
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:07,876
The daaaaaa of the old man to the stilts
is even longer than the last time.

191
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,409
It… He sleeps!

192
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,275
Awake!

193
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:16,741
Upright, awakes!

194
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:17,608
Stop sleeping!

195
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:18,141
Daruma-san ga koronda!
Stop sleeping!

196
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,142
Daruma-san ga koronda!

197
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,809
Oh not!

198
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,209
Eliminated!

199
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,475
Let us forget these minor problems of sleep,

200
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:38,009
Kabouti has just been eliminated!

201
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:42,324
How it can fall asleep in similar moments?

202
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,609
It is completely the kind of our Ossan good old man!

203
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:49,476
Well! I can still catch up with them!

204
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:54,676
I thought that would be simpler
that, I start to worry me.

205
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:59,475
Four men of head…

206
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:02,808
are with 100 meters hardly meter.

207
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,408
Will the test be played now?

208
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,009
Only these quatre-là is in measurement
of touching the meter!

209
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,676
I count on you, Sanji!!

210
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:15,676
Nobody pays attention to us…

211
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:18,008
Yes, they ignore us completely.

212
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,676
I feel completely useless…

213
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:29,076
But, at least one is not only in this case.

214
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:32,342
Still a dead end…

215
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:38,009
It is cold… highly that
finish that I can be heated.

216
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:41,942
You draw aside!

217
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:43,876
Hamburger, descend it!

218
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:47,342
I will reduce to you out of pulp!

219
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,809
You want to fight, salts gorilla?

220
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,209
This time…

221
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:57,676
Hamburger attacks Sanji!

222
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:03,174
During this time, Chiqicheetah
moves towards the meter!

223
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:07,342
Porch-chan succeeded in putting Sanji at the variation!

224
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,409
What?

225
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,075
With me victory!

226
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:16,276
Shit!

227
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:20,942
Chiqicheetah has just leaped on the plate!

228
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,542
Atchouuum!!

229
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:41,408
Eliminated!

230
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,341
Oh! What a sneeze!

231
00:15:44,342 --> 00:15:47,809
Tonjit had not started to say
“Daruma-san ga koronda”!

232
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,274
Were the effort of the pirate vain?

233
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:53,809
Chiqicheetah was eliminated because of a premature departure!

234
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:57,008
Shit! The meter, is not necessary to sneeze!

235
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,676
One was there almost…

236
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:07,742
The net of snot of the old man to the stilts is super length!

237
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,275
I owe him one of them…

238
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:12,676
A sneeze…

239
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:16,808
There is no what to laugh at it, Hamburger.

240
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,876
One must gain Choppy costs which costs!

241
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:23,674
The two teams are very close to the meter!

242
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,674
The exit of the play will surely decide with the next turn!

243
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,609
The meter it will be touched…

244
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:31,175
By the duet Porch-chan and Hamburger?

245
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,808
Or by Sanji?

246
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:35,009
Which it will be?

247
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,675
Open the eye well!

248
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:39,742
Daaaaaaaa…

249
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:43,676
Daruma-san ga koronda has just started,
there will be no false start!

250
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,609
Excuse me!

251
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,276
What you make, Hamburger!

252
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,674
Ru-my-san…

253
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:03,542
It is for the good of Robin!

254
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,474
Oh! Sanji!

255
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:07,808
What!?

256
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,209
Where is Porch-chan?

257
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:12,076
Calm yourself, Porch-chan!

258
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:16,542
In concerning, I could take again Robin.

259
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:18,742
It will surely fall into my arms!

260
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,408
Sanji!

261
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,009
Hurry to touch it!

262
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,409
Ossan, thank you for your co-operation.

263
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,224
What?!

264
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:39,074
It would be said that Sanji made half-turn.

265
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:40,274
What occurs?

266
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:45,209
Even if it is about a competitor, I cannot
to be unaware of the call of a lady in distress!

267
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:52,009
Incredible! The Sanji cook comes
to help Porch-chan!

268
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,609
Da!

269
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:59,142
Hamburger hopelessly tries not to fall.

270
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:04,209
Although it saved Porch-chan,
Sanji will undoubtedly be eliminated!

271
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:10,941
Oh! not! Sanji and Porch-chan do not risk anything!

272
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:14,675
Even if Sanji is in water,
it is perfectly motionless.

273
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,942
It does not move at all,
it is not eliminated!

274
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,574
Impossible!

275
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:23,676
How can there remain motionless in water?

276
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,941
He swims on the spot.

277
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:30,075
It manages to hold Porch-chan without moving
the upper part of her body!

278
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:32,141
It with the grace of a swan!

279
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:36,675
Under water its legs swim with insane pace,
but from here one can see only this calm face.

280
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:40,024
As long as it does not move in front
the meter, it does not risk anything.

281
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:43,742
Sanji is well decided to gain…

282
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:49,142
No matter what it arrives, I must save Robin-chan.

283
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:52,676
Sanji is likely still to gain.

284
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:56,224
It is too strong this type.

285
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:57,541
You are incredible, Cock-san.

286
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,275
Sanji, be to you really a good sort.

287
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:03,676
Iyan, I could fall in love with you, Cock-san…

288
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,942
Ooooh! Porch-chan and Sanji sank!

289
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,142
You are both eliminated!

290
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:19,476
He, stroke correctly or one will run!

291
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:23,009
Provided that Robin-chan did not see us.

292
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,324
Daaaaa ruuuuu…

293
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,408
It has just taken again its Daruma-san ga koronda!

294
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,341
It does not remain any more but…

295
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:34,224
Hamburger of the team of Foxy and…

296
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,874
The meter is right in front!

297
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,941
Nobody can any more stop us!

298
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:40,876
I am not able to believe it!
One will touch the meter!

299
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,074
maaaaa saaaaaa nnnnn…

300
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:45,341
Let us touch it all together!

301
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,674
Ouais!!

302
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:51,475
Goods with nothing the team of the straw hat
how we had forgotten are about to succeed!

303
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,475
That for a surprise!

304
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,476
One did not expect such an end…

305
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,942
Just when I find the good way…

306
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:06,675
I will make like the other cook…

307
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:08,409
Take that!

308
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,875
gaaaa kooooo rooooo….

309
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,275
Brilliant!

310
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:16,676
The team of the straw hat will gain!

311
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:20,076
Yosh! Victoire!

312
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,542
nnnnnnn da!

313
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,408
It is Hamburger which touched the meter!

314
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:42,741
And the winner of this Dodge, Touch & Daruma-san is…

315
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,742
The team of Foxy!!

316
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:51,409
It is our second crushing victory,
in this return match!

317
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,475
What? It is already finished?

318
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,608
It is finished because of you!

319
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,474
With the worst possible result!

320
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,409
All is of your fault, Zoro!

321
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:08,374
Brilliant, it is finally in my turn!

322
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,276
As a captain I will recover my companions!

323
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,009
You forget something of important, straw hat.

324
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:22,042
As you lost second once, you go
to lose another team-member in addition to Nico Robin.

325
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:25,974
But, you can gain only one team-member per test.

326
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:31,209
Even if by chance you gained the next test…

327
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,076
What you baragouines, head of puzzle?

328
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:39,741
He says that even if you gain the next test,

329
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:42,276
you will be able to recover one team-member.

330
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:47,941
Therefore, no matter what you make, straw hat…

331
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:51,142
You will have lost one of your comrades!

1
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,120
What is what does not go, Usopp?

2
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,830
The money… the money disappeared!

3
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,440
Ah! Over there!

4
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,050
Thank you, my guy!

5
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,910
Wait, enfoiréééés!

6
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,849
One succeeded!

7
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,959
You stop!

8
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,860
Franky Family.

9
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,769
These bags… are with us!

10
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,329
Money… money!

11
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:37,530
Galley it Company!
And the splendid N°1 Dock.

12
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,660
Wait, Paulee!

13
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,329
You will not escape to us, this time.

14
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,509
But I had asked you for a new time!!

15
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,670
It is…

16
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,870
It is Paulee.

17
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,330
It is still continued by its creditors.

18
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,089
Return to us our 200 million!

19
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,160
Afflicted, Nii-san! I will take care well of it!

20
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,289
Heeey!

21
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,469
It is you who them ace given the money?

22
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,499
And then what still! They stole it to me!

23
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,689
What?!

24
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,219
Give us the money!

25
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,449
As I already said, I do not have a round for the moment!

26
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,640
Your problems do not concern us!

27
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,350
'Silvering, they insist.

28
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,740
Over there, one will yagara bulldozer.

29
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,220
ROTION

30
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,389
Engineer de Galley it Company!

31
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,509
Please excuse me, but I must borrow your will yagara a few moments!

32
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,680
ROUND

33
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,740
Shit! He still fled!

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,159
And well, so long!

35
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,250
One will make “mumuse” another time!

36
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,840
Shit!

37
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,350
And well… You arrived at the good moment.

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,009
Thank you my God.

39
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,389
It of your employees, isn't this is one?

40
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,410
Completely.

41
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,179
Thank you!

42
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,639
This money is with us!

43
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,570
Hein? Money?

44
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,960
Oh, that…

45
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,149
Oii, return!

46
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,500
This jerk! I go the choper…

47
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,080
I will go there!

48
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,650
A pigeon?!

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,360
It is the valet de chambre…

50
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,050
Apparently, it is timid…

51
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,690
This floor needs to be changed.

52
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,300
What you insane?!

53
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,610
You do not worry! As soon as I throw an eye in it, I will give all to his place.

54
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,649
Have-have-have-have, oi, oi, oi, detaches me!

55
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,710
But what you insane?!

56
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,150
I will not escape!

57
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,019
I said to you that I had included/understood!

58
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,940
Release to me the ear!

59
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,450
For once I put the hand on a little money.

60
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,020
You will see, Lucci!

61
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,040
Do not settle your debts with the money of others, idiotic!

62
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,399
I FOUND this money!

63
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,909
And you think that I will believe you?!

64
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,260
I fell on this will yagara bulldozer by accident!

65
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,320
They return.

66
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,660
One leaves oneself there well, Usopp.

67
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,299
You let it make?!

68
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,389
200 million Berrys, it is much of money!

69
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,019
Ouais! Then, why you did not do anything?!

70
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,839
Because this pigeon said “I will go there”.

71
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,060
Nmaaa, I am sorry…

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,530
We deal with idiots among our members.

73
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,530
If you had caught it, that would have annoyed me.

74
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,530
Well, let us leave side Franky Family and forget all that.

75
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,419
Admittedly, but…

76
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,210
Ca hurts…

77
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,960
Did He, where pass the types badly equipped with presently?

78
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,890
Franky Family is a group of disassemblers of ships.

79
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,000
Disassemblers? They however did not have the air of honest workmen.

80
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,320
But they are also bargain hunters.

81
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,640
They track the pirates who accost in the city and generate the combat.

82
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,620
These people sow the disorder.

83
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,480
If they leave gaining against the pirates whom they accosted…

84
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,110
They also destroy their boat.

85
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,860
They disassemble it and sell the parts in good state.

86
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,879
Such is the business of Franky Family.

87
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,249
Which cowardice. And what do they make of the crew?

88
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,049
Nmaaa… For most covetous, a reward is always good to take.

89
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,880
They however do not have the air very strapping men.

90
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,690
They are only subordinates.

91
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,380
But do not underestimate Franky, their tapi chief in the shade.

92
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,650
Whore, it was less one.

93
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,510
Oi, you are well?!

94
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,060
I am healthy and except.

95
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,240
Oi! Where is the crew of Straw hat?!

96
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,000
They are surely still with the dock n°1.

97
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,209
We bring back it for you, Iceberg-san!

98
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,309
Stop! My ear!

99
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,110
Afflicted disturbance, Lucci.

100
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,789
A thing is sure, this cretin poses many problems to us!

101
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,720
It goes back to speaking!

102
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,440
Go, excuses itself, Paulee!

103
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,739
This pigeon speaks too much much!

104
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,269
It would be said that he speaks in the place about the type.

105
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,290
At all events, we found our money.

106
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,850
Is He, it with you?

107
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,509
I bring back it for you.

108
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,320
Ah, Thank you!

109
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,660
If you want to thank me, you ace that with me to give 10% of them.

110
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,220
Please it excuse, customer.

111
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,460
Its passion of the play him because much of debts.

112
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,390
It loses the reason as soon as it is about money.

113
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,159
Of agreement, but how you make to speak?!

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,750
Jerk, you cannot it close, Lucci?!

115
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,280
I will not forgive myself!

116
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,420
Punishment

117
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,630
But why it takes that so much with the serious one?!

118
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,970
Hung with a wire

119
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:30,480
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

120
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,800
IPONRI

121
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,399
How is it?

122
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,500
Nmaa… It is always similar.

123
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,020
Look at that!

124
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,150
It deadened the shock of a hand!

125
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,350
Its fingers are embedded in the ground!

126
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,920
It is what these fingers which it has?

127
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,160
What does not go with the naval engineers, here?!

128
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,990
Oi, you with the glasses!

129
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,260
Hello! Do not only forget…

130
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,739
That which caused you and humiliated, it is…

131
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,040
The PIGEON!

132
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,510
I of insane.

133
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,300
That which struck me, it is Lucci!

134
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,870
It struck you because the pigeon could not do it.

135
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,880
Oi, the pigeon!

136
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,370
He, assumes you when you must fight!

137
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,850
Say something!

138
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,909
You in redemandes?!

139
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,319
You of ace have enough?

140
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,040
Stop that, Paulee!

141
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,080
Good, excuse us for these nuisances.

142
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,630
I am Rob Luc… nonon… Hattori, the pigeon!

143
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,710
Here Rob Lucci! He works here!
Charmed to meet you!

144
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,020
He is expressed like human now.

145
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,849
I included/understood!

146
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,489
You are ventriloque!

147
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,889
Really?! Then it was you which spoke presently!

148
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,929
You are very strong! I would never have guessed!

149
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,460
Stop, it does not have nothing extraordinary there.

150
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,880
It is an eccentric unable to speak directly to people.

151
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,740
Wait! Who is this woman!

152
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,149
It is what?

153
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,750
What a dépravée!

154
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,380
You show too much your legs!

155
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,250
There are only men on this work place!

156
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,459
It is what this getup?!

157
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,210
Paulee, calms maintaining to you.

158
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,129
You also, Kalifa!

159
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,790
You do not have shame to still wear this clothing?!

160
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,219
How much time will have I to repeat it to you?! Puts long pants, pants!

161
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,139
What?

162
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,910
Long pants?

163
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,890
It is zarb, him too!

164
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,030
Nmaaa… Ca is enough.

165
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,570
Start by opening the door, one goes there.

166
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,359
In any case… This door is giant!

167
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,950
The opening is manual?!

168
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,960
How these two insane can open it alone?

169
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,470
Ca moves!

170
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,859
Nmaa… When they work on a building site,

171
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,010
their competences of engineer are sufficient for five people per dock.

172
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,030
Kaku, that you saw presently, is one as of theirs.

173
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,930
It is a world of carpenters.

174
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,700
Made not attention with all these not very common personalities.

175
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,229
They are really zarb.

176
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,180
Ah, it is open.

177
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,339
Preserve the money close to you henceforth.

178
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,770
Although there are no pickpockets inside.

179
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,590
Of agreement, please excuse my errors.

180
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,110
Oi, Luffy!

181
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,910
Protect me, ok correctly?!

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,839
Yosh, I know! You ace that with me to entrust them!

183
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,679
I am not convinced.

184
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,640
Trust me!

185
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,909
Here, in the dock n°1, the main activity of Galley is it Company.

186
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,670
One deals here with the most difficult work.

187
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,320
Come, enter inside.

188
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,220
Enooorme!

189
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,840
Seen from here, this shipyard with the really brilliant air!

190
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,180
Ouais.

191
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,759
They build an enormous galleon!

192
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,049
Who is the customer?

193
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,940
There are full craftsmen.

194
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,170
Come… by here.

195
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,329
Oh, it is Iceberg-san!

196
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,560
Oii, the owner is there!

197
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,649
Hello!

198
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,140
Hello!

199
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,590
Owner, could you throw an eye on quality of these boards?

200
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,460
Of course, I arrive in a few moments.

201
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,950
[Otsukare:nobody have just completed a work]

202
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,950
Otsukaresama, Iceberg-san!

203
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,559
Maaa, Otsukare. Is all well?

204
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,120
Yes, all occurs for best!

205
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,550
Ca then?! Ice-ossan is very popular here!

206
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,470
Obviously. In this city, only competences count.

207
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,229
Many shipyards were undertaken in the past.

208
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,990
Seven shipyards were in competitions.

209
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,550
At the sides of the craftsmen, it astonished by share its knowledge in naval construction.

210
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,129
The company which gathered the seven manufacturers of boats…

211
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,440
Was called Galley it Company.

212
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,480
Its competences and its enthusiasm for joinery did not change since.

213
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,410
Never the craftsmen will forget this respect which they have for him.

214
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,439
And because they are proud their competences…

215
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,630
They will resist eternally vis-a-vis the pirates and the government.

216
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,070
Thus is this place.

217
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,000
Oi, Ossan!

218
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,569
It was said to me that you were an excellent naval engineer! You want to become pirate with me?

219
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,070
What you tell?!

220
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,939
Insolate!

221
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,259
Ola, ola, it is always like that.

222
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,729
Excuse it.

223
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,459
Nmaa… You do not have a naval engineer on your boat?

224
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:29,150
Ouais, one came here to repair our boat and to find a companion moreover.

225
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,939
And well, we have many engineers…

226
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,890
But I do not know if one of them would like to join a pirate crew.

227
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,909
If somebody wishes to join you, I will not prevent it.

228
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,119
Really?! Now that you said it!

229
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,639
Why not you, Ossan?

230
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,629
Nmaa… I cannot. I am the mayor.

231
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,590
Ca does anything!

232
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,029
On this subject, is there really a woman of the name of Nico Robin on your boat?

233
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,510
Yes, of course! She is even super intelligent!

234
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,190
What is there?

235
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,130
Does Y' have a problem with Robin?

236
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,470
Not.

237
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,779
He, Ossan.

238
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,209
I can see this boat more closely?

239
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,220
Of course, that is equal for me.

240
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,870
Thank you!

241
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,300
It is really brilliant!

242
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,590
Rather as that, take your time, gently!

243
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,970
If there were a gun like this one on board, Merry would be…

244
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,020
Ahh! A half-culverin!
[Culverin:Canon transportable of the end of the Middle Ages]

245
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,780
It is so long! Ca shines!

246
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,509
I will like so much to test it at least once! !

247
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,000
It is the moment!

248
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,549
Would this be copper?

249
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,580
It must be expensive.

250
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,230
Would they let to me test it?

251
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,469
But wait!

252
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,079
We have 300 million Berrys now!

253
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,470
We can easily buy one of them!

254
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,980
But where did it pass?

255
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,310
Where did Robin leave?

256
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,620
By there.

257
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,250
This odor…

258
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,780
It is well what I thought!

259
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,380
I wonder who was this guy camouflaged with Robin?

260
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,730
It was perhaps Chopper, after all?

261
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,630
Sanji!

262
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,960
Chopper.

263
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,710
Kaku…

264
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,959
Where were you?

265
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,169
In expertise.

266
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,839
Ah, the person of presently.

267
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,279
Did you throw an eye on our boat?

268
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,720
Yes, I did it.

269
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,950
Iceberg-san, finally I find you.

270
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,780
I included/understood the problem… How is that presented?

271
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,440
It is that…

272
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,030
Luffy, go down!

273
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,420
Ouais, I arrive immediately!

274
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,880
What, it is true?!

275
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,410
You will regret it if you lie!

276
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,540
I am a professional, I do not lie.

277
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,050
Where is Usopp?

278
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,570
He trotted himself by over there presently.

279
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,570
Oi, you!

280
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,160
Isn't these bags are with you?

281
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,749
These are the bags whose Usopp was to be occupied. They are with us.

282
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,880
Thank you.

283
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,490
But, where Usopp passed?

284
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,879
While dropping all this money…

285
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,619
Money?

286
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,760
Ouais, it there 200 million Berrys inside.

287
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,600
200 million Berrys?!

288
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,840
Ouais it is that! So long!

289
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,390
Ca, it is sure…

290
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,030
Then, how long that will last?

291
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,909
We can pay as long as you will want.

292
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,280
One has full of money.

293
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:56,830
If possible, one would like something of more robust, with more guns, and more rapid.

294
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,660
Could you also add some decorations on wood?

295
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,970
And to remake the interior of the parts, too?

296
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,350
A bronze statue too!

297
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,509
As graaaande as you can!

298
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,940
Good, wait…

299
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,810
You return without doubts of an enthralling voyage.

300
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,699
Ouais, one flew then one fell from the sky…

301
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,119
Climbed mountains, and even taken in ambushes!

302
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,979
Full with tricks happened.

303
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,700
It is for that a repair of quality is wanted.

304
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,759
It is not to laugh…

305
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,100
It is what I see.

306
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,040
The wounds of the engagements are too deep.

307
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,150
Does that want to say that repair will take much time?

308
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,570
Not.

309
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,670
To be honest, your boat…

310
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,330
Is not reparable, even by us.

311
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,270
Is the skittle broken or what?

312
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,570
Ouais…

313
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,080
It is seriously damaged.

314
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,210
It is not possible…

315
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,690
But until now, we always could sail without problems!

316
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,960
Even if we repair it best than we can…

317
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,950
The chances to reach the next island are of…

318
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,850
Zero.

319
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,599
Merry…

320
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,780
You…

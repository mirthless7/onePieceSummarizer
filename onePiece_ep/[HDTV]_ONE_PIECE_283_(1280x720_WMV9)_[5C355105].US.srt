1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,250
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,150
The man who had acquired everything in this 
world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,890
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,570
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,500
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,220
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,010
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,330
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,320
They passed through the Aqua Laguna to come here.

10
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,020
If you think about it, it's amazing.

11
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,050
Seems like they're quite lucky.

12
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,200
This time we have permission to kill.

13
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,400
This is gonna be easy if we don't have to hold back.

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,470
The drawbridge?

15
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,120
Yeah.

16
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,720
The Franky Family is fighting for it at the moment.

17
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,440
Once they lower it, we'll be able to get to the other side.

18
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,760
Really...

19
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,820
She's just in front of our eyes, too.

20
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,230
I'm CP9.

21
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,130
I thought I had thrown everything away.

22
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,760
I didn't want you all to come.

23
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,410
Why did you follow me?

24
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:37,200
Everything Is For A Nakama! Robin In The Dark!

25
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,560
What I have to say is about Nico Robin.

26
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,580
Do you know something?

27
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,380
Did she act differently after you came to this town?

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,090
Yes, all of a sudden.

29
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,610
After she went into town, she disappeared.

30
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,750
Then this morning, she became the culprit of your assassination attempt.

31
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,820
When our nakama finally found Robin...

32
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,920
Well, she said she wasn't coming back to us.

33
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,870
We had no idea what was going on.

34
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,000
So tonight, we were going to ask her again in person why she was leaving the ship.

35
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,320
That's why we came here tonight.

36
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,980
It's to make my wish come true.

37
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,430
A dream that could never be fulfilled while I'm with you.

38
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,820
What's this dream that won't come true if she's with us?

39
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,690
Let me tell you what I know.

40
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,370
It's probably when you first lost sight of her.

41
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm CP9.

42
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,430
The government's plans were already in motion.

43
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,030
Of course, there's a reason behind that woman's actions.

44
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,540
But before I tell you that...

45
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,720
Keep in mind that Nico Robin and I have the ability to revive the ultimate weapon...

46
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,200
...and destroy the world!

47
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,180
The world?

48
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,480
That's right.

49
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,830
There's been an obstacle in our plans.

50
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,960
Everyone gather in the main bedroom at once.

51
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

52
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,830
Do you understand, Nico Robin?

53
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,430
The blueprints you're all after are fake.

54
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,600
Even if I'm killed, I will never let the government have the blueprints.

55
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,180
But on the other hand, if you intend to decrypt the Poneglyph and help the government...

56
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,220
Then I have to stop you right here!

57
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm not after the Poneglyph to revive the weapon.

58
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,160
I just...

59
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,320
I want to know history.

60
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,130
That excuse doesn't mean anything!

61
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,130
I've always said this...

62
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,670
Again and again...

63
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,980
Even if it's not your intention,

64
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,430
a lethal weapon will hurt people.

65
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,330
Even a person that means everything to you!

66
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,290
There's no good or bad when it comes to hurting someone.

67
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,830
If your desire to know history will result in ending the world...

68
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,070
You need to die here and now, Nico Robin!

69
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,750
Do you still wanna chase after history, even after the demonic destiny of Ohara?

70
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,240
What the hell do you know about Ohara?!

71
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,960
The World Government...

72
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,780
You have no idea how much my life's been screwed up by their hands!

73
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,510
If you really hate that government so much...

74
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,350
Why do you side with them?!

75
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,290
Even if I have to throw away everything, there's a dream I want to fulfill.

76
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,220
There are two conditions that CP9 pressed on me in this town.

77
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,370
The first of which, was to lay the blame of your
 assassination on the Straw Hat crew.

78
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,380
The other, was to turn myself over to the government afterwards...

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,910
...and to obey them.

80
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,920
If that happens, you'll die.

81
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,400
How can a woman, that ran for twenty years, accept those terms?

82
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,310
CP9 have been...

83
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,340
They've been granted permission to use a Buster Call against the Straw Hat crew, just this once.

84
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,670
Buster Call?

85
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,310
An emergency command that dispatches five Lieutenant Generals from the Marine Headquarters, along with ten warships.

86
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,000
If they were to face the government's force of war...

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,530
There would be nothing left...

88
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,940
Normally, in the Marines, there are only three Admirals,

89
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,010
and the top of the Marines, the Fleet Admiral, who are granted this authority.

90
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,260
But this time, the CP9 have...

91
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,570
They've been granted permission, just this once, by Admiral Aokiji.

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,100
If I don't accept their terms, then they'll initiate the Buster Call against us.

93
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,550
When I heard Aokiji's name, I gave in.

94
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,430
For the past twenty years...

95
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,220
I was able to escape any situation, because I didn't have anything to protect.

96
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,090
By deceiving people and using them as shields.

97
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,810
But now, I really can't do that anymore.

98
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,800
The life I once threw away...

99
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,430
The heart I had lost...

100
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,960
My dream that once ended...

101
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,770
They were all saved!

102
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,980
I now have nakama that...

103
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,850
...believe in someone like me.

104
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,700
Then, your wish is...

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,240
Excluding myself, to have all six of the Straw Hat crew safely leave this island.

106
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,440
For that reason, you don't care that you'll resurrect a lethal weapon that could destroy the world?!

107
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,110
I don't care!

108
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,270
LUFFY!!

109
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,320
What are you doing there?!

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,510
Na-Nami! Are you behind me?!

111
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,900
Hey! Oi! Listen here!

112
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,300
Geez, when that pigeon guy blasted me away,

113
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,120
I flew right in between these walls and got myself stuck!

114
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,970
Stop fooling around!!

115
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,240
At a time like this, while you were horsing around, Robin got taken away!!

116
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,230
Robin is intending...

117
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,440
...to die for us!!

118
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,860
By sacrificing herself, Robin saved us from an attack by the government!

119
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,440
She knows that if she's taken away, she'll be executed!

120
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,370
So, Robin really was...

121
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,940
She was lying to us.

122
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,560
That's great.

123
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,830
It's here!

124
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,680
It's so cool!

125
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,610
Amazing!

126
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,480
Just to let ya know, it's not in the greatest shape.

127
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,340
This thing's name is Rocketman.

128
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,830
It's definitely not meant for carrying passengers.

129
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,630
Shall we go then?!

130
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,370
Departing from Water 7!

131
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,470
Heading to Enies Lobby, sea train Rocketman!

132
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,410
Yosh!

133
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,440
Take off!

134
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,870
Here we go!

135
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,350
To get everything back!!

136
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,840
Woah! It's amazing!

137
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:15,220
If I so wished, the authority to overcome all the power in the world is now in my control!

138
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,900
Why did Aokiji grant you the power to use the Buster Call?

139
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,010
Don't you dare question me!

140
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,690
You insolent bitch!

141
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,600
If it wasn't for me, the value of your existence would have been nothing!

142
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,850
You should be thanking me!

143
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,520
The disgusting blood from the demon's land of Ohara...

144
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,770
Nico Robin.

145
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,880
Hurry!!

146
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,320
Run for the emergency shelter!

147
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,550
Extinguish the fire!!

148
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,500
Protect the books!

149
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,410
Ohara didn't want to expose history...

150
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,630
They wanted to accept the voices of the past and protect them!

151
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,370
No! I want to stay here too!

152
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,480
Mom!

153
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,530
Mom!!

154
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,100
LIVE, ROBIN!!

155
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,830
Listen well, Robin!

156
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,890
You might be alone at the moment.

157
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,170
But someday,

158
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,090
you'll definitely find nakama!

159
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,620
Nakama?

160
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,710
Yeah.

161
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,710
The sea is vast.

162
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,380
Someday, without any doubt,

163
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,730
nakama who will protect you will appear!

164
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,200
Monster!

165
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Monster!

166
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,100
She was abandoned by her mom!

167
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,650
There's no way that anyone in this world is ever alone!

168
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:31,900
Someday...

169
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,130
...you'll understand.

170
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,260
It seems she's a survivor of the famous Ohara criminals, who were scheming to destroy the world.

171
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,560
Don't let her escape!

172
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,900
Alright, give me my money!

173
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,530
I turned her in, didn't I?

174
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,120
Your sin is the fact that you're alive!

175
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,100
Go meet your nakama that are waiting for you somewhere out at sea!

176
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,100
Robin!

177
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,720
Sogeking.

178
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,850
Make that flag...

179
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,860
...burst into flames.

180
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,230
Roger that.

181
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,780
My new weapon, the Giant Pachinko.

182
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:37,970
The name is Kabuto!

183
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,110
Behold the power of this weapon!

184
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,900
Hisatsu! Fire Bird Star!

185
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,030
They didn't...

186
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,110
Done.

187
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,660
Are you out of your mind?!

188
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,220
Don't think you'll be able to survive having the world as your enemy!

189
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,960
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR!!

190
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,290
Robin!

191
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,590
I still haven't heard it from your mouth!

192
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,980
SAY YOU WANT TO LIVE!!

193
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,320
To live...

194
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,370
You aren't supposed to live in this world, Robin!

195
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,840
Your existence itself is an unforgivable sin!

196
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:42,580
Robin!

197
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,320
I thought wishing for it was forbidden...

198
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,880
No one ever allowed me that...

199
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,630
The sea is vast.

200
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,220
Someday, without any doubt,

201
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,800
nakama who will protect you will appear.

202
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,820
If...

203
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,620
If I'm allowed to declare my wish...

204
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,340
Then I...

205
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,860
I WANT TO LIVE!!

206
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,120
TAKE ME OUT TO THE SEA WITH YOU!!

207
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,510
Let's go!

208
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,190
Oi, Nico Robin!

209
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,010
We have the assassination group, CP9!

210
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,010
Cutty Flam!

211
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,010
HERE WE GO!!

212
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,410
Robin, sorry we made you wait! We're on our way!

213
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,500
Th-The pirates are coming over here!

214
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,810
Hurry and get to the Gates of Justice!

215
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,950
Franky?!

216
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,330
Cutty Flam!

217
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,650
What you're holding isn't...

218
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,650
Th-Those blueprints!

219
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,270
Give them to me!

220
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,790
Next time, One Piece: I'm Not Giving You The Blueprints!
Franky's Decision.

221
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,050
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

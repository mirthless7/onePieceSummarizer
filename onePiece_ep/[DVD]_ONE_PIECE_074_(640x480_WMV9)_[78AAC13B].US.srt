1
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:23,010
The candle of the devil!

2
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:23,010
Tears of regret and

3
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:23,010
tears of anger

4
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,990
He! What you insane, Ossan?

5
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,350
Remove this rock of me!

6
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,220
You at the right moments.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,380
But with do the fact, what you make here?

8
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,160
What is there, Nami?

9
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,500
There is someone else

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,830
on this island!

11
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,570
It IS WHICH?

12
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,880
You…

13
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,630
Mr. 3.

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,710
Forgive me to use my code name.

15
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,890
I am only one humble sculptor.

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,670
And here my assistant, a realistic painter,

17
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,540
Miss Week Golden delicious.

18
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,510
Mr. 3? The man who ate the fruit Doru Doru…

19
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,150
It can create wax starting from its body and control it according to its desire. A human candle.

20
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,620
I… will never forgive you!!!

21
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,620
Dumb.

22
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,910
What do you make?

23
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,240
Hum… what I do do?

24
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,340
Eh well, before the end of the day,

25
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,010
you will become my very new artistic great project.

26
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,680
Calm yourself maintaining.

27
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,460
Did you think honestly that you could escape Baroque Works?

28
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,150
And especially with a man whose head is worth 30.000.000 of Berrys.

29
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,610
I am really happy of being able to make you pay what you did to me in Whiskey Peak.

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,350
The pirates should not line their nose in this kind of delicate situations.

31
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,740
We already caught your friend the fencer and the girl.

32
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,750
You had Zoro?

33
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,200
Then… you will be made slice.

34
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,110
You still speak?

35
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,670
Perhaps should I burst you then the face with small a kick bomb…

36
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,230
You believe that will hurt me?

37
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,970
I will péterai you the buttocks.

38
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,580
What a madness!

39
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,320
Luffy-San!!

40
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,700
Goes in hell!

41
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,430
Tsss, moron!

42
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,750
Luffy-San!

43
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,510
Luffy-San!

44
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,310
Luffy-San!

45
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,310
Allons-y, Miss Valentine!

46
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,980
Luffy-San!

47
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,370
Usopp-San!

48
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,850
Karu!

49
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,870
Salt bastard!

50
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,410
Oh, stop! Stop!

51
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,930
Once my Candle Jacket is solidified, it is almost as solid as of steel.

52
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,010
The unlimited force of a giant

53
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,360
is nothing once it was contained.

54
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,610
We use our heads,

55
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,850
thus we do not have to be obliged to face you face to face.

56
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,020
Leave the victory to your head.

57
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
The red ogre Brogy.

58
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,400
Do not look at me thus.

59
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,410
I died of fear.

60
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,820
Isn't Ca makes good?

61
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,450
This length, very long duel was finally completed.

62
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,070
You with honor during one century, isn't this fought?

63
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,680
Isn't the taste of the victory exceptional?

64
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,090
Although…

65
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,040
this time there was an outside assistance.

66
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,030
Amn't I right?

67
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,390
Dumb!

68
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,960
Not possible?

69
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,100
But at the end, there is a true victory!!

70
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,350
You did not know?

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,060
Your heads were put at price:
200.000.000 Berrys for you two.

72
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,780
And it is always valid.

73
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Dumb!

74
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,080
I feel as if I had discovered a hidden treasure.

75
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,090
Then it was that your plan.

76
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,230
Mr. 3!

77
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,450
We brought

78
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,120
the traitor of our organization.

79
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,020
You were slow.

80
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,560
I wait since one moment.

81
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,910
Your methods are contemptible, Mr. 3!

82
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,200
To think that you placed a bomb in the alcohol of Dorry-San!

83
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,920
What?

84
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,830
Alcohol?

85
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,370
Alcohol… that I did give him?

86
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,920
Dorry!

87
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,650
After so a long time, this drink was exceptional!

88
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,060
Ouais.

89
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,690
It had a divine taste.

90
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,550
It is what you wanted to say?

91
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,260
Dorry!

92
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,980
Therefore, the young girl discovered my small round.

93
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,280
It is nothing, it cannot nothing make to stop to me now.

94
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,900
Mr. 5?

95
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,110
Bring to me the fencer and the girl.

96
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,710
I start!

97
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,790
Tokudaï Candle Set = Méga Service with Candle

98
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,630
Then it is thus that the capacity of Mr. 3…

99
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,000
What does it make?

100
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,980
Here they are.

101
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,860
It is disappointing

102
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,770
to think that I was overcome by this crew of lower row.

103
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,320
It is if embarrassing!
I am ashamed of myself!

104
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,160
It arrived only because you are weak.

105
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,620
Hein? What do you say?

106
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,720
Nothing.

107
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,080
Dispatch you to place them on Candle Set.

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,040
Set?

109
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
What is it that?

110
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,590
Nami-San!

111
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,200
Mr. Bushido!

112
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,010
Vivi!

113
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,450
You were not with Luffy?

114
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,660
Yes… but…

115
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,300
You speak about Straw hat?
I completed it.

116
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,600
It was an easy work.

117
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,170
You?

118
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,720
Welcome everyone

119
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,910
in my Service Set!

120
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,470
Then here what does that resemble?

121
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,350
To be a candle on a cake.

122
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,060
It is what this trick which turns up there?

123
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,880
I cannot move my legs.

124
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,830
Why would it have let us move?

125
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,660
It is our enemy, you know.

126
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,740
Tsss, too hard!

127
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,620
And in this position, I cannot use my force.

128
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,850
Something falls.

129
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,560
Benefit from the taste of my Candle Service!

130
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,410
The wax which falls on your heads

131
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,550
will transform you into wax statues.

132
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,170
There is something that even my artistic talents cannot create:

133
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,320
the perfect human statue.

134
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,260
Just like its name indicates it,

135
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,110
you will become wax statues containing of the hearts.

136
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,810
For the glory of my art,

137
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,980
you will die.

138
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,310
But of course!

139
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,970
Why should one be your “art”?

140
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,330
Brogy-San!
You do not rest like that!

141
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,740
Made something or you will become also a statue of wax!

142
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,640
'silvering, they are really cowards…

143
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,060
Ca is not used for nothing to require of him.

144
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,430
It simply realized

145
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,210
that without to have noticed the wounds of its adversary,

146
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,480
it killed Dorry, the friend with whom it fought during the 100 last years,

147
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,630
of its own hands!

148
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,970
And this idiot has even versed tears of joy for this victory!

149
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,870
Or perhaps did you deplore the loss of your friend?

150
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,770
Now, nothing can any more it help, morons!

151
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,950
I knew.

152
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,990
I knew that something did not go.

153
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,130
At the moment when we began our combat,

154
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,300
I knew that Dorry hid something.

155
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,010
Humm, you known as whom you had noticed?

156
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,650
What a lying!

157
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,580
If it were the case, why to have continued the battle?

158
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,860
I saw at which point you fought ardently.

159
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,160
I did not see an ounce of sympathy!

160
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,430
How a kid who does not include/understand the direction of the word “Duel”

161
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,350
could it include/understand the reason of my tears?

162
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,610
How could you know?

163
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,750
A warrior dissimulates his wounds and continues to fight,

164
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,630
how do you dare to insult it?

165
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,360
How can you test sympathy

166
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,240
for a warrior who wishes a duel?

167
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,190
And now, I include/understand how that occurred.

168
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,720
And now that I know,
I will finish my own hands of them

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,340
how thanks for my best friend, Dorry!

170
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,880
Brogy-San!

171
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,530
Brogy-San!

172
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,530
Brogy-San!

173
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,630
What a irrascible monster!

174
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,550
Usopp…

175
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,960
Usopp…

176
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,180
Can you… forgive them?

177
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,280
Never.

178
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,020
I will never forgive them.

179
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,310
You also… you are in anger?

180
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,080
Yosh, let us smash them!

181
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,020
One goes them botter the bottom!

182
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,820
Brogy-San!

183
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,720
What a cretin!

184
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,900
It would be said that I underestimated it.

185
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,520
Even me, I could not await me the power of a giant.

186
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,720
It would be said that I will have to calm it myself.

187
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,540
Doru Doru Tekase Arts = Wax Shackles

188
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,210
And in here still!

189
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,000
And maintaining the blow final!

190
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,230
That catches!

191
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,600
Now you will not be able
to move definitively more!

192
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,910
What a cruel torture!

193
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,680
Now, more quickly, my Candle Service!

194
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,700
Change them into wax statues!

195
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,680
Ca burns me the chest.

196
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,260
The wax vapor penetrates the lungs…

197
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,280
If that continues, I will transform myself into wax statue of the interior!

198
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,300
Yes! Yes!

199
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,080
Show me all the pain that you test!

200
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,840
A pathetic face of pain and anguish

201
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,760
is the kind of art which I prefer!

202
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,120
Harden with these desperate faces!

203
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,740
It is what this form of art,
species of degenerated with the tied braid?

204
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,750
How do you dare to do that in Brogy-San?

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,810
You will collect what you deserve!
You hear me?

206
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,460
Braillez as long as you want!

207
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,330
100 years…

208
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,690
Day after day…

209
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,030
Fights after combat…

210
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,690
We fought with the original honor of Elbaf, the village of the warriors.

211
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,150
And now…

212
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,080
Why should that finish like that?

213
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,660
Oh God of the War, Elbaf!

214
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,380
Is this the judgment which you gave?

215
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,740
Elbaf!

216
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,300
Why did you let do that?

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,090
Why won't I die in the combat?

218
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,510
What a superb expression!

219
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,320
Exquisite!

220
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,980
This pitiful, failing expression is the supreme form of art!

221
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,840
Elbaf!!

222
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,330
Oh not! I cannot move my hands any more!

223
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,520
I do not want to die like that!

224
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,100
One can nothing make?

225
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,850
My body hardens already!

226
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,720
What can one make?

227
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,470
Can Zoro, what one make?

228
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,300
He Ossan.

229
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,710
You isn't can always move?

230
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,250
Me also, I can still move.

231
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,930
Would Ca say to you to butt these guys with me?

232
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,990
Zoro, what…

233
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,070
You do not go…

234
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,800
If.

235
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,370
To cut your own legs?

236
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,540
Stop joking!

237
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,770
I do not laugh.

238
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,490
It is the only means of leaving from here.

239
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,730
You decide what?

240
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,740
Our decision?

241
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,390
It is without hope.

242
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,210
Even if one manages to go down, we are recaptured immediately!

243
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,930
What do you know of it if we do not test?

244
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,040
We will die here in any event.

245
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,850
Why not do it in a dirty way and while fighting a little?

246
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,010
One will not burst so easily in front of this useless waste!

247
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,810
Not?

248
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,330
About what does speak he?
He is insane?

249
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,530
It is bluff!

250
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,750
You will be able to never do that.

251
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,330
It is right pride!

252
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,720
Which bold kid…

253
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,490
I believed that I had lost

254
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,510
my reason to beat me.

255
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,880
With such a spirit, how do I can refuse?

256
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,950
You talk cock there?

257
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,050
You are serious?

258
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,440
How will you fight without your legs?

259
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,220
I do not know.

260
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,440
But,

261
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,560
I intend to gain.

262
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,620
What does it have this type?

263
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,830
It cracked!

264
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,360
How this kind of anybody can exist?

265
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,360
But I have the impression to have already seen these eyes-there before…

266
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,960
Princess Vivi.

267
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,310
Did you decide not to die?

268
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,050
With… Wait…

269
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,330
I will fight too!

270
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,020
Vivi!

271
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,300
Yosh! I included/understood!

272
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,940
Allons-y kid!

273
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,140
Do not even test!

274
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,390
What do you think of being able to make?

275
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,580
I go you botter the bottom!

276
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,360
What?

277
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,990
Allons-y, Usopp!

278
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,700
Ouais!

279
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,240
The bird!

280
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,110
Luffy!

281
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,230
Usopp!

282
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,140
Karu!

283
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,880
Brogy Master!

284
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,500
We are here to avenge your sorrow!

285
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,550
Usopp…

286
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,400
Satisfy you to smash these guy

287
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,550
until they are full with holes and make steal them!

288
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,160
Ouais! It is what I intended to do!

289
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,330
They destroyed the duel of Ossan!

290
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,730
It is you?

291
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,740
The most required man of East Blue?

292
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,220
The Navy seems to have lowered its criteria.

293
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,840
Ouahou! You ace an odd head!

294
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,720
It is not your problem!

295
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,490
It is one 3! One 3 ignited!

296
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,040
Your mouth!

297
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,700
Before that, Luffy, destroy this pillar!

298
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,450
One soon will become human wax statues!

299
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,240
What? You have troubles?

300
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,680
Not it is nothing!

301
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,670
What? Wait!
Your legs…

302
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,260
Oh, I cut them only to half.

303
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,960
How is that it nothing?

304
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,350
In any case, Luffy…

305
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,970
Does Ca say to you to destroy this pillar initially?

306
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
I will leave them afterwards to you.

307
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,580
Included/understood well!

308
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,920
I do not think.

309
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,010
Whatever this thing,

310
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,530
let us destroy that in first!

311
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,670
Yosh!

312
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,880
I included/understood.

313
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,760
I am a different man today!

314
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,970
You, good blood dispatch!
One hardens!

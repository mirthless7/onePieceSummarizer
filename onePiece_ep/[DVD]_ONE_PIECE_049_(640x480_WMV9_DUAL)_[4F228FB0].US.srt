Many pirates are supplied here before moving towards Grand Line.

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,520
I will buy good material to me.

17
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,490
I am sure that one can unearth much good things to be eaten here…

18
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,250
And much of pretty girls too!

19
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,310
Me also I have something to buy!

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,220
Good Ah, Zoro, and how?

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,980
Well, I will throw an eye with the bracket.

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,100
Burst!

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,800
My glasses! My glasses!

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,150
Is He, it that which you seek?

25
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,460
Afflicted…

26
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,340
It should be refunded to me!

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,100
You fall well.

28
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,430
You can say to me where is the bracket?

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,370
Follow the direction indicated by smoke.

30
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,370
Let us raise our glass to its health!
With the eternal Lord of the Pirates!

31
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,480
With the eternal Lord of the Pirates!

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,020
This type with the straw hat,

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,400
it is Monkey D. Luffy!

34
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,500
It is here that the Lord of the Pirates died…

35
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Here that the Âge d'or of the Pirates started.

36
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,350
The last vision which the Lord of the Pirates had before dying, I want also to see it!

37
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,010
Well, a little grimpette!

38
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,590
Colonel Smoker, where do you go?

39
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,470
With the bracket.

40
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,870
I want to see it… The place where the Lord of the Pirates died.

41
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,400
It is there that it will be.

42
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,910
You speak about Monkey D. Luffy?

43
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,170
100 of our men are ready to capture it.

44
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,780
Loans to be fought until death!

45
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,050
You do not pigez or what?

46
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,850
I will only go, that will be enough.

47
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,680
He!

48
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,780
He, kid.

49
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,030
What?
I am a little there occupied.

50
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,690
It is well you? The most required criminal in any East Blue?

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,800
I am called Luffy.
Does Y' have a problem?

52
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,060
I am here the captain of the base of the Navy with Logue Town, Smoker.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,750
I come to stop you!

54
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,480
Ah, to stop me?
I refuse!

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,050
I will install for Grand Line and will become the Lord of the Pirates!

56
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
The Lord of the Pirates?

57
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
Therefore, how I could make me stop here?

58
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,650
Then you will have to beat me.

59
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,050
If you do not arrive there, you are not likely any to enter Grand Line.

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,350
It is the rule here.

61
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,130
Thus all will depend on you, if you have courage to fight against me.

62
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,210
I must overcome you if I want to go in Grand Line?

63
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,640
Then I will beat you!

64
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,910
Thus test.

65
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,010
This type… is a man-rubber band!

66
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,000
Shit! My feet are wedged!

67
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,570
Moron! What you insane?

68
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,690
It is not my fault, they are my feet…

69
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,780
Yes! I am free!

70
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,030
Too much slow!

71
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,060
You, you would be worth 30 million Berrys?

72
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,440
I do not even need to use my capacities of the Fruit of the Demon.

73
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,520
My fists will largely be enough.

74
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,050
I arrive!

75
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,420
I was pilot what here did without 20 years ago.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,690
This guy who had the pride and the ambition to be the Lord of the Pirates, in his last moments.

77
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,660
You, the Lord of the Pirates? Do not make me laugh, you are not even able to reach Grand Line.

78
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,580
It is useless, even if you manage to raise you.

79
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,680
Bah, how knowledge as long as I didn't test?

80
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,200
Allons-y!

81
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,090
Oh not!

82
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,730
Ouahh! Am plantéééééé to me!

83
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,600
What is it that this kid?

84
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,360
Ah! I finally found you, my dear Miss!

85
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,400
Shit, I made error.
Thank you, so long.

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,950
But however…
It is really cracking!

87
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,890
Thank you for your purchases!

88
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,780
Can He, I have that too?

89
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,500
What does it still manufacture him?

90
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,200
As envisaged.
According to the charts, it passed well by here.

91
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,130
The hour of our revenge finally sounded.

92
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,230
You think of being able to finish some with him?

93
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,850
Obviously!

94
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,890
That which will die is…

95
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,450
Swelled… It is you?

96
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,340
Captain! There…

97
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,540
Ouah, I flew bloody far…

98
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,570
And it was which this guy initially?

99
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,930
What will I make now?

100
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I have well time… for a small nap.

101
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,570
Does He, that go?

102
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,970
He died?

103
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,620
Where you go?

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,410
You broke my glasses, not?

105
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,630
But I said to you

106
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,730
that I was going you to refund them.

107
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,860
You do not seem to have much money.

108
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,850
And moreover, you seem to hide something.

109
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,730
I do not have money, it is true…

110
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,450
Rings around your eyes…

111
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,990
They say that you are somebody who apparently, did not eat days since.

112
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,020
Your mother is very sick,

113
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,200
or you left your wife
leaving only to nourish five children?

114
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,490
Euh…

115
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,880
I do not force myself to answer myself!

116
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,180
Is, it is to me all.

117
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,430
… Navy?

118
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,690
Hold!

119
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,140
Our caretaker resigned this morning.

120
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,700
As long as you will work for the Navy, you will not have any money worry.

121
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,910
Which chance, you don't believe?

122
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,000
You insane of me?
Why should I work for the Navy?

123
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,600
You want to flee?

124
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,950
You take the kindness of the others for acquired?

125
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,950
Therefore, you want to say that you are concerned less poverty with

126
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,020
your heart that of that with your hands?

127
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,780
Euh…

128
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,540
Staff sergeant, it is the hour of the exercises!

129
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,430
Well, do of tone better, agreement?

130
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,270
Staff sergeant?

131
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,520
I bought full with businesses.
Still a last shop…

132
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,500
Navy?

133
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
Pfff! Why do I do that?

134
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,220
Is Zoro… in the Navy?

135
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,860
One will make as if I had not seen it.

136
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,750
Shit! How one can do something with that?

137
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,180
Three brushes, it is better after all…

138
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,810
You! What do you make here?

139
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,520
I know it!

140
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,260
It is him, Zoro, the hunter of pirates!

141
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,450
Why does it clean our grounds?

142
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,270
It belongs to the crew of Monkey D. Luffy!

143
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,990
You are in a state of arrest!

144
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,540
Good, I do what now?

145
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,110
What did it occur?

146
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,550
It would be said that they were attacked!

147
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,400
Their attacker fled!

148
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,000
“Money for the glasses”?

149
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,350
Which shock…
Shit!!!

150
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,580
It is really the spit portrait of Kuina. And moreover,

151
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,590
it is a fencer who uses a katana.

152
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,540
It would be said that the world is really small…

153
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,460
In any event, I do not think any more of re-examining it.

154
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,340
I want to buy katanas.

155
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,720
Well, well, well.
Welcome.

156
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,690
Take your time to look at.

157
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,450
Has this shop existed for 200 years, you knew?

158
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,140
I have 100 OOO Berrys.

159
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,210
Sell to me two katanas.

160
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,940
Hein? 100.000 Berrys for two katanas?

161
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,140
Is Pfff, this type mown or what?

162
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,580
For 50.000 each one, you will have only rotted sabers.

163
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,360
That will be always better than anything.

164
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,320
I do not have much money in any event.

165
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,320
“That will be always better than anything” than he says…

166
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
That must be an amateur…

167
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,780
This saber…

168
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,460
He, He, He this ka… katana…

169
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,510
I p… can… the v… see a dryness… second?

170
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,700
Why are you nervous like that?

171
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,060
Go, show!

172
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,410
Which odd type…

173
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,630
I do not manage to believe in it!

174
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,340
Oh… Ohhh… The calm one.

175
00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:01,780
They is not the every day that a beginner brings one of famous “the Meitô” in my shop!

176
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,100
It is necessary that I speak calmly.

177
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,710
This katana is in sorry state,
but I want to give you some Berrys of it well.

178
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,890
I give you 200.000 of them Berrys.

179
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,950
Thus that will make you 300.000 Berrys,

180
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,620
and you will be able to buy three katanas with 100.000 Berrys.

181
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,650
Hein? What do you tell?

182
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,540
Well!

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,440
I… I give you 250.000 of them.

184
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,250
Not? 300.000?

185
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,350
500.000 then?

186
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,890
Whatever the sum which you will offer for this katana…

187
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,770
Very well! You gained ace! 650.000 Berrys!

188
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,200
I included/understood, are to you a businessman!

189
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,590
I buy it to you for 800.000 Berrys!

190
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,230
Hello!

191
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,820
I come to recover my Shigure.
It is ready?

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,080
Ah! I am content.
You do not have anything!

193
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,110
Somebody was introduced into the base of the Navy presently!

194
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,550
And then you disappeared.
I believed that it had arrived to you something.

195
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,430
It is what its problem with that one?
I am reassured.

196
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,240
But, since you are well,

197
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,560
that wants to say that you rejected the charity of your next while preferring to flee of an honest work.

198
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,090
Your money.
Take it again!

199
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,510
I refuse to accept money of a person who acts like that.

200
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,820
And then I already repurchased myself glasses.

201
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,680
Ahh! This katana! Not possible!
It is Wadô Ichimonji?

202
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,510
It is Wadô Ichimonji, it is that?

203
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,880
Wadô?

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,820
Keep silent yourself! Keep silent yourself!

205
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,420
What a splendid completion!

206
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,360
No the doubt, it is one of 21 Oowaza Mono!

207
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,400
Here! Look at that.

208
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,460
This sword is worth more than 20 million Berrys!!

209
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,260
But… why somebody as it has you one of famous Meitô?

210
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,500
YOU!!! You said to him!

211
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,600
What you interfere yourself,
you sabotage my business!

212
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,470
To sabotage your business?

213
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,920
Excuse me.
I said something that one did not have?

214
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,060
Came to you for your Shigure, hein?

215
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,590
Here it is! I sharpened it.

216
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Take and releases it!

217
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,800
Why suited you by there?
It is what your problem?

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,180
I… I am sorry.

219
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,900
Pfff! This small idiot you ace saved the setting.

220
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,810
This sword is indeed Meitô.

221
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,830
A sword which an amateur as does not deserve you to carry.

222
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,700
The katanas in these barrels are to 50.000 Berrys.

223
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,500
Take two and leave my shop!

224
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,120
Why is it put in this state?

225
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,060
You… really the sabers, isn't this likes?

226
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,580
Since you carry three from there…

227
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,810
That makes me think of this bargain hunter…

228
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,700
An bargain hunter, hein?

229
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,260
He is very famous. He is called Roronoa.

230
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,800
I heard this name much.

231
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,480
Yes, everyone in East Blue
knows its reputation of large fencer.

232
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,160
But it is a demon!

233
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,730
To use a katana as means to earn money, it is unforgivable!

234
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,450
Which funny of time when the evil is so powerful.

235
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,310
The large fencers all of the world are is pirates,

236
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,620
maybe of the bargain hunters.

237
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,520
All large are Meitô of the world between their hands, you knew?

238
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,060
The katanas cry.

239
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,370
Must Bah, they have their reasons, you do not believe?

240
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,590
It is necessary to live with its time.

241
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,720
Lastly, I swear on Shigure that

242
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,220
I will become a large fencer and will involve myself to improve!

243
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,590
And then I will travel of share the world, and I will recover Meitô of the hands of these gangsters!

244
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,330
12 Saijô Oowaza Mono legendary.

245
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,420
21 Mono Oowaza.

246
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
And 50 Ryû Waza Mono.

247
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,070
Even if I must leave the life there!

248
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,380
You want to recover that one too?

249
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,780
Is Wadô Ichimonji, it well that?

250
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,720
Eh! I did not want to say that I wanted to have all Meitô!

251
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,190
It is right which I do not support that they are between bad hands.

252
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,290
Hein? This katana…

253
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,890
This katana… perhaps that…

254
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,700
Yes, it is that! Sandai Kitetsu.
It is Sandai Kitetsu!

255
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,130
Its predecessor, Nidai Kitetsu, was one of Oowaza Mono!

256
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,970
And Shodai Kitetsu was one of Saijô Oowaza Mono!

257
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,450
Mister!

258
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,080
You want to really sell this katana for only 50.000 Berrys?

259
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,910
It is extraordinary!

260
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,660
It is an exceptional saber!

261
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,270
You, you should take it!

262
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,310
Its value is estimated at nearly a million Berrys.

263
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,350
It is a super business!

264
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,340
Not question!
I do not sell it!

265
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,540
It is well what I said.

266
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,830
This sword for 50.000 Berrys,
I found that odd.

267
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,190
Not, it is not for that…

268
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,820
It is cursed.

269
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,020
You knew it?

270
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,300
Not, I feel it.

271
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,230
Kitetsu are excellent katanas,

272
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,470
but they all are cursed.

273
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,830
All the fencers who used Kitetsu during time,

274
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,920
knew fine tragedies and mysterious deaths.

275
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,900
You will not find anybody who wants to use Kitetsu because all their predecessors died.

276
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,880
I wanted to remove me from this dirtiness because of the curse…

277
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,780
I… I am sorry!
I did not imagine this so terrible thing!

278
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,220
I will not have had to interfere me.

279
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,540
I like it.
I take it!

280
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,180
Be to you… Be to you nut? If I sell it to you and that you are made kill, it will be of my fault!

281
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,640
It is you that are nut!
Sell it and then it is all!

282
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,870
Ché… Darling!

283
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,610
What do you say that?

284
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,010
My chance… or curse of this sword…

285
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,020
Let us see which of both is strongest!

286
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,010
Not!

287
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,480
Stop! Its edge is exceptional!

288
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,800
You will cut yourself the arm!

289
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,640
I take it.

290
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,110
Do He, you want me to choose another of them well?

291
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,680
Euh… Yes!

292
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,200
With… Wait!

293
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,930
The sleeve covered with a long mosaic, enamelled in black.

294
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,150
The blade, the wire slicing like a razor.

295
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,730
Ryû Waza Mono, Yubashiri.

296
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,420
My shop is not very large,

297
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,280
but it is best the katana than I have.

298
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:58,880
I do not have the means.

299
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,630
I already said it, not?
I do not have money.

300
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,090
Not, the money forgets.

301
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,400
And I do not want money either for Kitetsu.

302
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
I excuse myself to have wanted to mislead you presently.

303
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,930
Too for a long time I did not cross a true fencer.

304
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,100
It is said that a katana chooses its Master.

305
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,380
I will request so that the chance remains with you.

306
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,490
Y' does not have to say, three sabers, it is well better.

307
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,630
Eh well, eh well…

308
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,120
I do not manage to believe that a skinflint as the saber of our family gave you.

309
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,270
Which evil is there so that a man transmits his dream to another man?

310
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,630
Very well, then leave the refuse now!

311
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,740
Yes!

312
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,270
I do not return from there…
I am able even more to raise me.

313
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,310
Ahh! I slept well.

314
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,550
Well, ahead!

315
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,870
I turn over to the bracket!

316
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,460
You found it?

317
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,170
Not, not yet.

318
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,970
Be sure for you that you saw Straw hat?

319
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,890
Yes, no doubt!

320
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,430
Very well, continue to seek!
Ouais!

321
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,890
But where is the bracket?

322
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,520
Straw hat… Straw hat…

323
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,220
Is Ahhh, where it?

324
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,220
Is Ahhh, where?

325
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,400
Dumb…
It is by where?

326
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,500
You seek what?
Where is the bracket?

327
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,530
By there.
Thank you.

328
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,740
AHHH!! It WAS…

329
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,750
Find Luffy!

330
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,450
It owes planquer some share here in Logue Town!

331
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,310
Yes!

332
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,120
I did not already say you not to howl,
that stops my thoughts.

333
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,410
It is not kind with planquer.

334
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,000
That will go, I will find it.

335
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,740
Colonel Smoker, that did occur?

336
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,310
Tashigi, where devil had you passed?

337
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,550
Co… Colonel, the aggressor…

338
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,020
You are awaked.
I am reassured.

339
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,610
You are well?

340
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,430
It was Roronoa Zoro.

341
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,770
One was attacked by Zoro the hunter of pirates!

342
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,830
Zoro?

343
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,070
Why would it have attacked you?

344
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,290
It is necessary that I capture it.

345
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,020
It is necessary that I find where is the bracket.

346
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,800
The last vision which the Lord of the Pirates had before dying, I want to see it!

1
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,410
This bastard with the straw hat?

2
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,410
It was not expected that Roronoa Zoro does not know its force.

3
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,950
How that?

4
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,410
Do He, you want to fight against Luffy?

5
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,410
I see…

6
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,460
You found something, Robin?

7
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,340
I know who am the culprit…

8
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,340
Not…

9
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,310
I know who am at the origin of these attacks.

10
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,270
Is this foutu kid?

11
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,520
Go, leave for the Palate the Divine Sea.

12
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,600
The Palate of the Divine Sea?

13
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,420
It is what?

14
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:37,990
Splendid, is not this step?

15
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:49,340
Zoro sharpens its sabers!

16
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:49,340
The combat against a wild beast!

17
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,780
Would this be the way of the refuge of this foutu kid?

18
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,420
Yes.

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,660
Really? Who is behind all that?

20
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,050
Say us please.

21
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,510
You will include/understand while arriving at the Palate.

22
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,020
Would they intend to attach me to a tree and to steal me my gold?

23
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,640
How is what I do!

24
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,390
Does there really exist?

25
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,560
It is very quiet here.

26
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,280
R… Re… Remain on your guards. It is the refuge of this dirty kid.

27
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,110
Perhaps he has ENORMOUS monsters under his orders?

28
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,160
Monsters?

29
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,340
The monsters are perhaps…

30
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,090
Hidden some share by there and go suddenly…

31
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,460
To attack you like that.

32
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,310
Yes… When I travelled on the ocean…

33
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,440
I often fell between the claws from these monsters.

34
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,760
He! You! Look behind you!

35
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,440
Hein? What is what there is?

36
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,210
Did you already see a monster here? There is not…

37
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,440
AAAH! REMOVE CA!

38
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,330
Never! Does not approach you me!

39
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,190
What is what they do?

40
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,050
One stopped…

41
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,750
This giant snake was afraid of the Usopp Captain and fled!

42
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,030
He!

43
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,610
We lost the others!

44
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,620
What one will make now, jerk!

45
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,120
It is not good that!

46
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,810
What is what one will so do of the monsters attack us?

47
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,890
Ah, does not worry you. It was right a joke to frighten you.

48
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh, it was a joke…

49
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,010
You make fun of me, crét…

50
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,180
Monsters!

51
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,960
Then it was true.

52
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,280
If you come, then it puffs out!

53
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,850
Although it is a tanuki, it is delicious!

54
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,480
Stop! DECREE!

55
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,070
Was Ah, it only you? You really did us fear.

56
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,220
Aaah, not good…

57
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,040
Other the insane furious one returned.

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,700
But it was not like that on the boat.

59
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,270
Well, If you are able me to convince and me requests to join us…

60
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,130
I will make you member of the crew of the Usopp Captain… ah?

61
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,760
He… He… Listen to me.

62
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,480
Wait! Do you know where are the different ones?

63
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,410
He!

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,460
Do not leave me all alone!

65
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,330
He! Await me!

66
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,120
Ah, Zoro!

67
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,000
Still this foutu swashbuckler?

68
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,250
Hum? It is…

69
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,670
You decided to come with us?

70
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,220
Pay to!

71
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,460
Captain!

72
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,410
What is what it is?

73
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,150
WHAT!

74
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,980
Why you excite yourself of a blow?

75
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,170
Stop both!

76
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,380
Hum, you would not have.

77
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,870
The behavior of this foutu swashbuckler changed much.

78
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:43,830
It is…

79
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,580
They was dangerous!

80
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,150
Stop!

81
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
It will be crushed!

82
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,840
Where is the guy with the straw hat?

83
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,950
You are really unconscious!

84
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,610
There by amicable agreement do not seem to be solutions.

85
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,950
But what does it have this guy?

86
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,010
It seems to be under hypnosis.

87
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,480
It is certainly the fault of this kid.

88
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,770
Ca becomes tedious.

89
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,430
Let us attack it all together.

90
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,820
Do not interfere.

91
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Continue.

92
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,870
I occupy myself some.

93
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,880
Ok, one goes there.

94
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,410
But it is Zoro, the hunter of pirates.

95
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,620
It would seem that you must beat it if you want to calm it.

96
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,140
Yes. The first thing to be made is to stop the boy.

Is this a way of calming a companion?

100
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,440
If it strikes it with its punch, it will be seriously wounded.

101
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,930
Because it is his/her companion…

102
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,950
And because he knows his force…

103
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,950
He must all give to stop it.

104
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,840

105

There is a cook, a doctor, a gunner and me, the navigatrice.

Nothing prevents us from going up on the boat.

117
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,980
Will you really follow this woman?

118
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,130
The pirates all are covetous and loose.

119
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,850
Luffy and this woman mislead you!

120
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,620
Try to include/understand!

121
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,550
Follow me, I will carry out you where you will want.

122
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,130
Do not want you to turn over in your villages?!

123
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,560
I want to turn over at home!

124
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,690
I need some really.

125
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,640
I do not know where they hope to take me along.

126
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,200
I would make perhaps better join it, instead of remaining with these monsters?

127
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,210
I would well also like, but…

128
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,950
It is true?!

129
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,540
Then why you hesitate?! Let us return on our premises all together!

130
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,930
I understand that you have evil to trust me because of your amnesia…

131
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,860
But follow me please, even if you think that I mislead you.

132
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,590
You hear?

133
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,110
It misleads you!

134
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,830
We all must carry out our dreams.

135
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,310
Think so that you ridges!

136
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,950
The men cannot live only for their dreams.

137
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,260
You do not let have!

138
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,360
It is true…

139
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,700
But…

140
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,730
What has you there it of more important than your dreams?

141
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,480
“Achieve your dreams, it is most important! ”…

142
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,800
Is probably what the captain would have said.

143
00:13:59,330 --> 00:13:59,930
I am…

144
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,020
I go with Nami.

145
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,560
Let us return on our premises, in our villages!

146
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,610
I remain with Luffy.

147
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,510
Why!?

148
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,660
Luffy regards me as his/her companion.

149
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,990
Just like Dr. Hiluluk and Doctorine!

150
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,750
First of all, before we return on our premises and that we carry out our dreams…

151
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,890
We must catch this foutu kid and him botter the bottom.

152
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,540
Incredible!

153
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,350
In this case, we go there.

154
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,100
Is not this step?

155
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,990
Shit! I cannot return without having to find my memory!

156
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,600
Wait!

157
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,250
Then I will return all alone.

167

Thus this phenomenon is present only here?

168
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,740

It is a legend, but this history is appropriate perfectly for the situation.

172
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:17,020
The memory is manufactured each day. This is why it makes use of the inhabitants of this island to nourish itself.

You stop!

176
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,350
The pirates are really obstinate.

177
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,880
I will take control on you, as I did for the swashbuckler, and will make you you entretuer.

178
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,330
Oh, not!

179
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,860
Ah! Hands! Hands which come from nowhere…

180
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,250
It would seem that I must initially deal with you.

181
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,700
To strike a kid is not in my practices, but…

182
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,730
Not, it is not the kid…

183
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,400
Qu… That is what I have…

184
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,600
Is this you who stole us our memories?

185
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,730
Cook, the kid was only hypnotized.

186
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,960
The person in charge is…

187
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,310
He you… Wait.

188
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,140
I will not let myself go further as long as you will not have returned to us what belongs to us.

189
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,450
“As if I were going to give up these delicious memories! Baka!”

190
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,290
What!?

191
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,520
Doctor-san includes/understands what the animal says.

192
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,080
Speak normally, you it OCTOPUS!

193
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,520
“Polished Remainder! I am not an octopus. I am a hippocampus!”

194
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,330
How is what I have with foutre!

195
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,440
You!

196
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,050
And you!

197
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,710
Spit all that you have!

198
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,410
What? I am…

199
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,490
Still not…

200
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,510
It IS FINISHED!

201
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,770
Sanji-kun!

202
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,130
Ca returns to me!

203
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,300
We found all our memory!

204
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,670
Cook! And you?

205
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,820
Me as well sure!

206
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,820
Robin-chan and Nami-swan!

207
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,040
You are all the two beautiful ones even after having found my memory!

208
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,820
But…

209
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,050
I wonder whether head of marimo found the memory…

210
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,050
[Marimo:marine animal of Japan]

211
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,460
What let us be made for Zoro if it is not the case?

212
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:02,880
Zoro!

213
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,470
And Luffy?

214
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,800
Was Luffy made kill by Zoro?

215
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,910
Not… It is impossible…

216
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,570
Where is the captain?

217
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,140
Whore of swashbuckler!

218
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,970
If you intend to make evil with these young ladies, I will be your adversary.

219
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,440
He says:“I have still a chart to play”.

1
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:56,000
In order to recover Chopper, Zoro and Sanji
take part in the second Round:Groggy Boxing ring.

2
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,866
Hamburger catches up with Sanji!

3
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:02,733
It has the goal in full line of sight!

4
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,733
You believe that I go…

5
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,933
to let these assholes mark!?

6
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,266
It is out of the question which I leave this cretin…

7
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,266
of swashbuckler to steal me once again the high-speed motorboat!

8
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,466
They start to type me on the nerves, leader.

9
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,332
The enemy is really groggy!

10
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,932
It does not remain any more but with…

11
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:57,933
to trail the ball with an aim and it is gained!

12
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,533
He! Cook!

13
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,533
You can help me, just 10 seconds?

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,866
That would have…

15
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,232
to be sufficient.

16
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:21,233
ATTENTION WITH THE CARTON ROUGE!
GROGGY BOXING RING

17
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,932
We are in the second round of
this Davy Back Fight, Groggy Boxing ring!

18
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,332
I do not think that they will be concerned as soon as!

19
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,665
It was obvious, nobody cannot beat our monsters!

20
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:35,400
The team of the straw hat valiantly fought,
but it did not have any chance to be left there!

21
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:39,400
There remain to me nothing any more to comment on,
the match arrives at its end!

22
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,666
He, look at! They…

23
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:47,000
They are upright! The team of the hat
of straw was raised!

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,132
What a appalling tenacity!

25
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,465
Roronoa the epeist and Sanji the cook…

26
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,000
Will they succeed in reanimating the combat?

27
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:00,800
Go! Smash to them the mouth!

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,866
I wonder whether there remain to them forces to fight?

29
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,466
He, you three…

30
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:17,933
“Monster Burger” and that jumps!

31
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:23,799
Qu-Quoi?

32
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
I wonder what it is…

33
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,465
Ah? Hold! They sell burgers in the corner?

34
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,400
But of course that not!

35
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:36,666
Oh the cow! Oyabin has just ordered
“Monster Burger”!

36
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,466
He! They do what? They had funker of the weapons!

37
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,066
“Initially one will chop, Hamburger!”

38
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,533
“Then let us cut them in sections, Pickles!”

39
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,199
The ingredients are?!

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,066
“Of the salad green and yellow cheese!”

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,933
“And two large bread sections to do one of them…”

42
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,133
“MONSTER BURGER”!!

43
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,332
And here!

44
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,066
Their the most powerful and vicious combined attack!

45
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,265
They are without pity! They violate without
care rules of the game!

46
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,466
The team of the straw hat is foutue in advance!

47
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,866
Oh! Thus look at that!

48
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:49,533
The referee continues his heating!
And the back turns to the play!

49
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,465
BUT WHAT YOU GLANDS YOU!?

50
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,465
Await Luffy!

51
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,399
But, it…!

52
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,066
You ace not yet measuring rod? They want
that you attack the referee!

53
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
You must keep your calm, Luffy!

54
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,332
All is avoided! The attack of Groggy
Monsters can start!

55
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,000
We cannot be held responsible
of its consequences…

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,133
Their target is obviously the ball “Sanji”.

57
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,399
They are chopping it, cutting out it and on the point of crushing it!

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,133
I wonder what it will resemble like hamburger!

59
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:23,666
It will be hard of concocter a decent dish
with similar ingredients…

60
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,133
But I could tenderize your flesh without problem.

61
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,733
Let us chop them!

62
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:31,800
It is fast!

63
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,599
That is badly!

64
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,466
Stop crushing!

65
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,666
Leader!

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,133
How oses you?!

67
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,266
One trains a team, does not forget.

68
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,799
Bastard…

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,333
I will cut out you in parts!

70
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:43,599
It is what that!?

71
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,866
Big Bang is made slice by the blades of Pickles!

72
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,333
I cannot stop bordeeeel!

73
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,600
Finely “good mannerss”…

74
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,000
Pa-Pa-not-believable!!

75
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:20,800
It succeeded in stopping Big Bang in its fall!

76
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,466
What a kick devastator!
Big Bang do not fall but it is very sounded!

77
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,733
What you will make, Pickles?!

78
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:31,666
The team of Foxy is in dangeeer!

79
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,732
Look at! Zoro the sword-man will benefit from it!

80
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,866
Its target is without any doubt the Big Bang ball.

81
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,466
You will not pass!

82
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,532
You obstructed the passage…

83
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,266
You and the other referee of shit!

84
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,866
He shooté Pickles crushes on the mouth of the referee!

85
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,800
It is a true terror this Master cock!

86
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,466
Bastard…

87
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,133
How oses you to be caught some with the referee…

88
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,733
PAPERBOARD ROU… HE?!

89
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,466
But that…

90
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,933
Where are my paperboards… and my whistle?

91
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,400
Unpleasant girl…

92
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,466
It is a day before practice.

93
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,799
Oh, still a problem with the straw hats?

94
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,866
There remains only Big Bang to be cut down,
but they still seem to dispute.

95
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,133
Incredible!

96
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,199
Big Bang…

97
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,865
What?!

98
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,532
Not possible!

99
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,666
Its gigantic body…

100
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,000
has just ejected itself!

101
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,465
GO!!

102
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,400
It aims at the goal!

103
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
Impossible!

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,565
GOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!!

105
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:32,833
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

106
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:40,333
MUGIWARA-TEAM

107
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Pa-Pa-not-believable!

108
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,066
It flies away!

109
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,800
GO!!

110
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,666
Impossible!

111
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,133
It is finished!

112
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,933
GOAL! GOAL! GOAL!

113
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,066
Super!

114
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:11,666
Zoro!

115
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,000
Sanji-kun!

116
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,399
It was mortal!

117
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,299
Zoro!

118
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,199
Sanji!

119
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,999
You are terrible!

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,132
Brilliant!

121
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,267
One gained!

122
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,933
I do not want to lose my Choppy…

123
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,399
I do not return from there!

124
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,799
These guys are too balèzes!

125
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Cheer! Cheer!

126
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:39,199
I have the tears with the eyes of them…

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
You assure serious the guy!

128
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,267
Bandage morons!

129
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,467
Our adversaries did not glorifiez!

130
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,999
How they could…

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,867
to embank our Groggy Monsters!?

132
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,199
You are awaked Mister the referee?

133
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,799
Dispatch you to blow in it.

134
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,733
Go! Quickly! One hurries!

135
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:02,866
Oooh, ah yes…

136
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,800
Its deplorable control must be sanctioned…

137
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,733
I will exclude it from the ground!

138
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,399
And it is the final whistle!

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,267
It is the end of Groggy Ring!

140
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,099
They was too cool!

141
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,200
Played well! Zoro! Sanji!

142
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,600
Ah! Thank you for the knack!

143
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,000
In the second round of Davy Back Fight,
they beat invincible Groggy Monsters…

144
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:51,800
and gained the match…

145
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,267
Which bright victory for
the team of the straw hat!

146
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,733
How if Zoro and Sanji could lose!

147
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,466
Nami-swaan!

148
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,866
Robin-chwaan!

149
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,732
You saw that!? You like me?

150
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,467
You were marvellous.

151
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:15,600
You have me foutu the tokens to make the idiots like that…

152
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Stop striking me.

153
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,866
Fortunately how I was there!

154
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,733
You speak… anything did you.

155
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:32,667
Now, winners of this round Groggy
Boxing ring, the crew of the straw hat…

156
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:37,267
can take is a member of Foxy
Pirates, is their pirate flag.

157
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:41,800
Which will be the decision of the captain to the straw hat?

158
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,133
Oh… I believe that the choice is clear.

159
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,267
Hein? It is… me?

160
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,599
Then…

161
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,867
Then it was me whom they wanted!

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,366
Oï Oï…

163
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,699
I do not feel ready mentally…

164
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,167
He saw me!

165
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,733
Oh not, it will take to me…

166
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,332
Then it is really me…

167
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,599
what it chose?

168
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,467
That could be me!

169
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,800
If I am taken, I should separate me from all my pals…

170
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,066
These types…

171
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,800
It is me whom they like…

172
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,066
Luffy…

173
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,333
Hurry.

174
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,799
Yosh! I go…

175
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,267
Wait a little!

176
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,067
Why that, Nami?

177
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,532
In the third handle…

178
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,800
Oyabin still will try to have to us.

179
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,132
If one is taken in his Noro Noro Beam,
though one makes to leave oneself there…

180
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:48,000
One will be foutu in advance.

181
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:54,133
But! If one takes their Oyabin now to them,
there will be less difficulties for the third handle!

182
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:57,467
Indeed, if one takes Chopper as of now,

183
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:01,667
one could again lose it
at the time of the third handle.

184
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:07,733
In other words, if one takes Oyabin now,

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,867
then one is certain not to lose Chopper afterwards.

186
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,199
Ah! This girl…!

187
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,600
She wants to take our Foxy Captain?!

188
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,199
He, but it is cheating!

189
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,400
And to say that I believed you cool!

190
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:26,200
Bandage cheaters!

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,533
You with the honest one beat!

192
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,399
It is not contrary with the rules, but…

193
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,066
If you take the unfavourable leader as of the second round,

194
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,733
what a dishonor it would be for your reputation of pirate!

195
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:45,400
But what a vicious! This woman
succeeded in making me chialer!

196
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,133
Nami, the navigatrice!

197
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,532
Bandage puffiness! You to take some in Nami like that…!

198
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,267
I go you battered the mouth!!

199
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,667
In all the history of Davy Back Fight, nobody has
dared to resort to such loose and pitiful methods!

200
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:04,600
I ask it to you with you spectators, one
is such victory a true victory!?

201
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,400
NOT!!

202
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:12,000
One swore on Davy Jones to deliver a combat
regular! Can one ridicule such a promise!?

203
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,933
NOT!!

204
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,932
They are malicious!

205
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:21,467
It is ok when it is them which cheat,
but not when it is us…

206
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:25,333
CHEATERS! CHEATERS! CHEATERS! CHEATERS!

207
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,333
What you have a problem?!

208
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,399
I am of agreement with Nami!

209
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,000
Do not cry Nami, all that it is of your fault.

210
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,133
You will close your mouths?

211
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,132
You want to be made knock?

212
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,800
We are sorry.

213
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:45,133
Well well… it does not matter after all, because what counts…

214
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,667
it is the final decision of Monkey D. Luffy!

215
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:53,133
It is free to choose one of our fellow-members.

216
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,667
It is all considering, it will take to me…

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,200
I should close my eyes for step that he sees me.

218
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:03,133
Who could it take of other besides me?

219
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,532
Not… Do not look at me!

220
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,933
Pity, not… wait a little!

221
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,733
Please, not me, I love too my crew.

222
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,732
Then it is me to finish?

223
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,600
It is me whom one will take it is that?

224
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,066
It is not…

225
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,067
It is thus me whom they will take?

226
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,067
Straw hat… dumb…

227
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,867
Then it is me whom you want hein?

228
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:36,333
Obviously… Who of other that could be?

229
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,866
Good-bye, my Foxy Pirates!

230
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,733
We trained a beautiful team.

231
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:45,000
I promise not to cry when they separate us.

232
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:50,800
Aaah! It is undoubtedly my charm which allured you.

233
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,000
It is true that I am the missing link for
how the crew of the straw hat is perfect!

234
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,600
Said, Miss the navigatrice.

235
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,533
It is true that your plan is logical, but it means
that this Oyabin will integrate our crew definitively.

236
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,667
One does not want any.

237
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,733
Oyabin lost consciousness with the emotion!

238
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,999
These people are not aware of the sensitivity of Oyabin…

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,867
Iyan Oyabin, you are irreplaceable in our hearts!

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It is true that, Oyabin!

241
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:28,866
Friends…

242
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:31,266
Let us show them what one is worth!

243
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:33,600
Ouais! One goes marrer to the next round!

244
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,467
You are loved, Oyabin!

245
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:36,933
Oyabin!

246
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,933
Friends…

247
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,666
It is true…

248
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,666
The only comrades which I need it is you.

249
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:44,800
I am sorry!

250
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,667
Stop this comedy, buffoon.

251
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,267
Oyabin!

252
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:54,000
It would seem that the crew of the hat of
straw does not want Oyabin, then…

253
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,733
Who will be thus the elected official?

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They is good… I chose.

255
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,800
Return by here…

256
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,000
SHELLY!

257
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Pa-Pa-Pa-not-believable!

258
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,133
That which Monkey D. Luffy wants is it
chevaaaaal adored of Tonjit, Shelly!

259
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,533
But of what does he thus think?

260
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,600
You ace an idea of what you come
to make, imbecile of captain?!

261
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:31,866
Ouais, of course.

262
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:34,532
But did brothel, what still take this time to you?

263
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,799
You make always very through!

264
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,467
Ch' it-insane-likes, do not stretch me the fissage like cha…

265
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:44,733
From now, Choppy us
will belong for always.

266
00:19:46,933 --> 00:19:51,000
If you did not want Oyabin, it is
Chopper that it was necessary to take!

267
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,867
But it is that I make some wanted…

268
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:01,667
I recovered Shelly for you, Ossan.

269
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,732
Friends…

270
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,733
You will be together from now on.

271
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:09,733
Thus said both of the bottom, you
seem well badly in point.

272
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,533
You are well?

273
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:14,267
It is because of this light-haired boy
who trailed in my legs.

274
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,800
Obviously you are occupied.

275
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:26,333
Afflicted… and thank you.

276
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,467
Forget that.

277
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,200
Yosh yosh yosh yosh...

278
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,667
Then it was for that.

279
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,333
I imagine that one could not make differently.

280
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,932
Return to see me one day, one will eat a cheese end.

281
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:44,600
PAS QUESTION!

282
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,467
I am really sorry.

283
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,533
I really thank you, thank you.

284
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,599
No the roblème Ossan!

285
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,399
Will that go with your companion? He is always…

286
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,666
It is true, Luffy.

287
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,867
You should a little more think so that Chopper feels.

288
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,867
Luffy.

289
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,400
Chopper…

290
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,733
Afflicted, Chopper.

291
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,466
One will gain the next test
and to bring back for you to the fold,

292
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,466
thus has patience still a little.

293
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:22,933
Be hard, not true for you?

294
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,000
Does my decision pose a problem to you?

295
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,600
Absolutely none!

296
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,067
Chopper…

297
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:38,267
Do not worry you one controls the situation!

298
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,733
Serious, is necessary for you that stop you playing it to you…

299
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,000
I wonder what will resemble the next play.

300
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,867
Is necessary to hurry, one must go there.

301
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,867
One must bring back Chopper as fast as possible!

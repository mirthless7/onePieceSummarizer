1
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,550
Eneru God…

2
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,430
is overflowed following the last
act of provocation of Sanji.

3
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,890
What makes it possible Usopp to help it.

4
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,020
During this time, Luffy…

5
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,949
start to climb Giant Jack for
to regulate its accounts with Eneru God.

6
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,679
Robin!

7
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,129
Does Eneru want the bell, not true?

8
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,620
It is at the top
is bean, it that?

9
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,179
With the right in the middle
happy meeting again,

10
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,279
having repaired the Arch
Maxim, Eneru God…

11
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,830
its attack begins again.

12
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,620
[Note:God of the thunder of
aboriginals of central Australia]

13
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,519
The guy, turn over to the boat!

14
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,020
I will seek Luffy
and I catch up with you!

15
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,900
Splendid!

16
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,860
Do not believe…

17
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,450
to draw you like that, Eneru!

18
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,579
B-brothel!

19
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,109
Ca fears! One must leave from here!

20
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,340
All will be destroyed!

21
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,629
Then it is there that they were.

22
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,050
These Shandia warriors
tedious and their hidden village.

23
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,699
They are originating in the Blue Sea.

24
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,550
They surely will appreciate that.

25
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,970
Now, go down in the Blue Sea!

26
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,480
Our village!

27
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,769
Ca could have been us.

28
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,110
If we had awaited one
little more, we would have died.

29
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,850
“Lend oath to Large
Karugara warrior! “

30
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,040
“Let us relight the flame of Shandora”

31
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,440
Wiper…

32
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,139
Your ancestor…

33
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,749
the Large Karugara Warrior,

34
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,700
had another reason to want with
any price to recover our terre natale.

35
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,220
Another reason?

36
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,639
Yes.

37
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,440
For Karugara, it was
what counted more.

38
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,569
Now listening.

39
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,780
The Large Karugara Warrior had a friend.

40
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,940
The friend of Karugara?

41
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,729
Yes.

42
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,460
400 years ago, it met
Karugara, its name was…

43
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,330
Montblanc Norland!

44
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:23,840
Guides by the sound of the bell! The legend
large warrior and of the explorer

45
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,639
He was once, he there
has very, very a long time…

46
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,429
Perhaps more than four centuries…

47
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,229
A history ever written,

48
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,850
but always engraved in
heart of those which heard it.

49
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,529
True story of the warrior
regarded as a demon…

50
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,730
and of the explorer
regarded as a liar.

51
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,530
Return on the boat!

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,700
The Demon of Shandora
is with our cases!

53
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,449
Quickly! Let us weigh the anchor!

54
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,469
Let us weigh the anchor now!

55
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,919
But Captain, the crew
is not yet on board…

56
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,230
It is an order! Weigh the anchor!

57
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,310
You will be eliminated!

58
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,450
Leave all and leave.

59
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,749
Dear Sir, the daily report/ratio!

60
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,800
Admiral, we reached our
limits of reserves in food!

61
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,719
We go now…

62
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,889
slowly…

63
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,790
to die at sea.

64
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,889
The cook disappeared.

65
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,800
Shit! The remainder of our food…

66
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,599
The Admiral fell to the sea.

67
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,349
It is Grand Line!

68
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,829
It drowned by giving up us?!

69
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,609
Perhaps that he preferred
a fast death with the famine.

70
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,819
It is ridiculous!

71
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,279
This man returned two
time living of this sea!

72
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,319
It is a great man.

73
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,650
Then, why it laid out its clothing and shoes like that on the bridge?!

74
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,239
H-He, somebody could go to see…

75
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,489
It is impossible!

76
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,159
This water is infested monsters!

77
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,860
It does not go up…

78
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,829
Admiral!

79
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,499
It was a coriace that one!

80
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,119
Here.

81
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,530
Euh… a cord?

82
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,050
Draw it!

83
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,339
It is what that?

84
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,299
Admiral, you killed
this thing under water?!

85
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,830
Cook it.

86
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,809
To remain sitted all it
time with nothing to make…

87
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,800
deadened my instincts.

88
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,689
We are taken in
a storm, Admiral!

89
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,889
One would say well!

90
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,059
I feel the boat to pitch.

91
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,600
“One would say well”?!

92
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,149
The rudder is broken!

93
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,099
Where is it?

94
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,780
The main thing! The main thing!

95
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,610
This, my third voyage, has
started there is more than two years.

96
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,570
It is a miracle which us
survived so a long time.

97
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,930
Did He, you hear that?

98
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,499
Hein? Heard what?

99
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,909
You speak about the lightning?

100
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,709
Not, rather like…

101
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,749
the repercussion
of a splendid bell.

102
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,450
A sound like that.

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,979
Priest, are you certain?

104
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,299
This ground was cursed!

105
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,009
If nothing is done, Shandia
will fall in ruins!

106
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,529
What do we have to make?

107
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,049
Can our village be saved?

108
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,969
Priest!

109
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,639
NR let us must offer we…

110
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,240
a girl!

111
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,870
On the Sacrificial Furnace bridge!

112
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,190
How much victims
there did it have?

113
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,690
More than one hundred.

114
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,119
How that may it be?

115
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,590
We never saw anything of such!

116
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,619
If that can save the village,

117
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,160
I will give my body with pleasure.

118
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,160
Why do you cry, mom?

119
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,300
I will meet God Sun.

120
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,960
It is an honor to be
chosen for a sacrifice.

121
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,550
Thank you to have raised me
all these years, mom.

122
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,360
MUSE!

123
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,350
If it is a bad dream,
let to me awake!

124
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,310
Make shit!

125
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,510
Leave!

126
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,220
Leave me!

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,310
Large Karugara Warrior…

128
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,139
Seto.

129
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,079
I wanted to be like you one day…

130
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,250
a honest warrior, fighting
to protect our ground!

131
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,420
I do not want to die like that!

132
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,529
I could kiss you, Admiral!

133
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,189
We took the direction that you
wanted, and of course, here is an island!

134
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,519
Ouais, and good news,
the storm seems to be calmed.

135
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,749
But, really, none
you did not hear it?

136
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,359
Not, nobody heard bell.

137
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,059
Hein?

138
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,989
Ouais!

139
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,690
You must hear things, Admiral!

140
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,749
Here is a quite luxuriant jungle.

141
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,620
I hope that one will find
beautiful specimens studied.

142
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,919
Admiral!

143
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,250
Ca must be what you
heard, Admiral!

144
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,280
He, that is enough!

145
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,420
You really believe that I would have confused the cry of this strange bird with a bell?

146
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,970
Have-admiral,
you have…

147
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,199
It is not true…

148
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
The tonality is so beautiful…

149
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,780
Then this island is inhabited.

150
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,660
H-He, Admiral! Wait!

151
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,879
Somebody is lengthened, there!

152
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh not! Of the intruders…

153
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,139
He, you…

154
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,170
Admiral, there is something
of strange with this child!

155
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,290
Remain there!

156
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,330
Leave me!

157
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,329
It is a plague known under
the name of Fever of the Trees.

158
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,149
It was not treated.

159
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,609
NR we let us must leave this island!

160
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,109
Doctor, do we still have of Cona?

161
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,130
Administrate amounts with this
child and with all the crew.

162
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,590
It is terrible.

163
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,910
Even harvests are infected.

164
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,870
Admiral, all the village is sick!

165
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,070
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

166
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,330
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

167
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,690
Take along the girl on the Furnace bridge!

168
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,610
God of the Sun!

169
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,880
God of the Rain!

170
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,209
God of the Forest!

171
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,750
God of the Earth!

172
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,639
In exchange of the life of this girl,

173
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,670
Please save our village!

174
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,600
It is Kashi God!

175
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,520
MUSE!

176
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,999
You do not have!

177
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,429
It can save our village!

178
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,919
Kashi God…

179
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,130
Which splendid form.

180
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,240
Please…

181
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,240
Please save my son!

182
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,830
And my father!

183
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,249
What?

184
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,400
Something fell.

185
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,530
What was it?

186
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,689
What did it occur?

187
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,919
Who is this?

188
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,340
Kashi God!

189
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,520
It killed God!

190
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,150
This ritual is finished.

191
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,039
You must be terrified.

192
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,489
All goes well now.

193
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,650
You do not have to die.

194
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,869
Kashi God!

195
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,329
Please forgive us!

196
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,249
The whole village will be cursed!

197
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,079
Kill them!

198
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,999
Offer more lives to God!

199
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,870
Before we undergo his anger!

200
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,629
Karugara! Kill it for us!

201
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,049
The Admiral is there really foutu!

202
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,719
They have really the furious air!

203
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,349
The Admiral does not have all his spirits!

204
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,049
He killed a god?!

205
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,299
What occurs?

206
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,809
We should not be implied
in the ritual ones of tribes!

207
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,390
Please alleviate the anger of
God, Large Warlike Karugara-sama!

208
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,350
I am an explorer of North Blue!

209
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,279
NOR Montblanc…

210
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,229
I insane of whom you are!

211
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,770
You will be eliminated!

212
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,649
Did you always very eliminate like that?

213
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,209
Including any form of progress?

214
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,899
I will not have a discussion with you!

215
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,730
You will pay for your crime!

216
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,650
Who is this man?

217
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,610
He fights equal footing with Karugara!

218
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,620
Now, uses it
knife and gives up your life!

219
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,789
What?

220
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,050
How oses you to cry and request for your life whereas you have the honor to save our village…

221
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
Do not feel you shame?!

222
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,090
It is enough!

223
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,010
Stop!

224
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,480
Have-admiral!

225
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,869
Our sacred duty since centuries…

226
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,919
was to banish all
intruders of this island!

227
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,919
You have committed the crime
unforgivable to kill God!

228
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,049
Your life alone cannot
not to refund that!

229
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,180
We will take your lives with
all for expier this atrocity!

230
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,599
Then, it is thus that?

231
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,839
Life? Sacrifice?

232
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,170
Is this that your Gods want?

233
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,460
This ritual insults the principles
big bosses of the past.

234
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,050
I will not let it remain!

235
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,530
For these explorers and researchers who
traverse the seas for our good with all…

236
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,489
it is a dishonor!

237
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,279
And if your Gods evaluate
your lives rightly,

238
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,650
this ritual is not it
méprisable for them?!

239
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,520
Give me time!

240
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,499
I will make disappear this
so-called curse!

241
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,379
And if I cannot,

242
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,210
you will do what you will want of us!

243
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,049
What?!

244
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,000
Dog! You are caught for God?!

245
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,639
In exchange,

246
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,699
if I can save this village,

247
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,680
you must promise more
to never practice this ritual!

248
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,689
It is all that you have to say?

249
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,809
What a nonsense!

250
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,019
You will die here and now!

251
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,890
Let test it!

252
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,550
What do you say?

253
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,060
Fate of these men
will be decided tomorrow evening.

254
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,060
I accept!

255
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,119
Then tomorrow evening…

256
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,870
We all will be killed!

257
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,099
Made confidence with the Admiral.

258
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,479
He, Miss.

259
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,269
Ca must be hard too for you.

260
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,839
It is a shame to be
born in this village.

261
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,029
Ouais, you ace well reason!

262
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,839
You would be enough beautiful to marry you
with an aristocrat, there from where we come.

263
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,709
Ca is enough!

264
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,540
Don't you have any tact?

265
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,040
This man…

266
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,970
You speak about the Admiral?

267
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,719
Montblanc Norland.

268
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Rather a famous explorer.

269
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,729
It is also a senior botanist.

270
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,719
He traverses the unexplored islands…

271
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,779
in the search of new species
vegetable that he studies then.

272
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,690
One could probably consider it
like a hero in our country.

273
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,149
But it is too nice like guy!

274
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,369
It feels obliged to intervene
in situations like that!

275
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,320
But it is known that one
can count on him!

276
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,909
Why you do not have
let Karugara kill it?

277
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,780
You will have the answer tomorrow.

278
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,549
He said that he would save the village.

279
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,539
We do not lose anything to wait.

280
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,339
How you can
to be also patient?

281
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,250
To be unaware of the words of the Priest
and to trust this man…

282
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,060
Karugara, say something!

283
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,349
If I feel the least
danger to weigh on this village,

284
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,930
I will not wait
tomorrow evening to kill it.

285
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,600
I do not have the capacity
to hear the voices of the Gods.

286
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,640
However…

287
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,249
I can hear the words…

288
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,220
of a wise man.

289
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,440
It is all.

290
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,650
Why are you still upright?

291
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,480
I am cured.

292
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,030
Large Karugara Warrior…

293
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,600
What did he hear by progress?

294
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,049
I found one of them!

295
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,840
It is Cona!

296
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,240
It was sure that I would find some
in a so large forest.

297
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,479
It is an earthquake!

298
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,979
Ca is there! This time that is there!

299
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,140
It is the anger of Kashi God!

300
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,110
He, make leave to us!

301
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,829
Which disaster.

302
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,379
The ground of the forest is very turned over.

303
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,950
This island splits itself into two.

304
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,710
What a spectacle!

305
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,380
It would be said that God chose
to punish you itself!

306
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,599
Then it would be said that your God…

307
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,649
is not as powerful as you say it.

308
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,890
It does not even have the capacity
to kill only one man.

309
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,930
You fights still.

310
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,839
Afflicted, but could you from go away?

311
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,710
I do not want to see your head.

312
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,069
I must…

313
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,110
quickly to go to the village.

314
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,939
Amusing.

315
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,740
I would like to see that!

316
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,490
Try to release you!

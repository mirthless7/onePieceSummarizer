1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,530
They are really strong.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,010
Shit. You made what? Say to me at least why!

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,230
It is we who would like to know.

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,940
Those which entered the office and which have to attack Iceberg-san…

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,010
It was you, hein?

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
You speak about Iceberg?

7
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,860
What does it occur?

8
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,450
You joke?! Why one would have done that?!

9
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,369
You intend to play the innocent one still a long time?

10
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,249
But one did nothing!

11
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,840
There were two people…

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,320
Iceberg-san remembered…

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,300
In its deposition with its alarm clock.

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,310
One was a masked giant.

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,610
The other a large woman.

16
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,970
We asked the government…

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,960
They said to us that it belonged to your crew.

18
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,820
Nico Robin, whose head is put at price!

19
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,480
Robin?!

20
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,339
Had you come on the island with an aim of killing Iceberg-san?

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,830
Or did you make this decision after having met it?

22
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,060
I do not know the practices of the pirates.

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,860
But now, we know that you are guilty, this is why you will not go further.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,700
It is him the culprit?

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,529
Unforgivable! Absolutely unforgivable!

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,950
Impossible!

27
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,130
Oi! Oi! Then like that, Iceberg died?!

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,150
It would not have been made kill so easily by snotty-nosed kid!

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,490
Since it would seem that you want some with the life of Iceberg-san…

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,980
One will finish some with you maintaining!

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,970
“Dead or sharp”

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,700
Living or not…

33
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,360
Do you include/understand this poster?

34
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,860
Though we make you, nobody will help you.

35
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,570
The laws do not protect you.

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,260
Yes.

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,240
One is of the outlaws.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,269
I am with the current.

39
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,660
But…

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,520
You do not know anything Robin, then do not speak like that about it!

41
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:04,350
Is the crew of Straw hat guilty?
Guards of Toilets 7

42
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,770
Luffy.

43
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,809
Let meet Ice-Ossan to me!

44
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,289
It is surely an error!

45
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,929
It is impossible that it is Robin!

46
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:17,000
One will not let a traitor approach Iceberg-san!

47
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,530
It rightly! Let us capture them!

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,549
They tried to kill our héro!

49
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,850
Let us catch them!

50
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,139
He! What it occurs?!

51
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,290
You!

52
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,459
Oi, Miss. You spoke with Straw hat presently!

53
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,399
You belong to the crew, you too!

54
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,709
Really?

55
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,389
Ouais, me also I saw it!

56
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,199
I will not let myself escape to you!

57
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,610
Do not move any more!

58
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,890
He, stop!

59
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,339
Nami!

60
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,859
Release me! Release me, I said!

61
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,879
What one made?!

62
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,009
Do not make the innocent one!

63
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,879
Bandage assassins, how have you to dare to draw on Iceberg-san?!

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,250
You will not escape!

65
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,769
Oi! Stop!

66
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,470
I said to you that one had done nothing!

67
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes, it is true. Robin did not have any reason to attack Iceberg-san!

68
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,550
Speak as far as you want.

69
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,380
In any event, it is finished by it for you two.

70
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,459
To wound this man, it is…

71
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,610
To do of Galley it Company, its enemy…

72
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,500
As well as the very whole city of Toilets 7!

73
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,099
Why one would have made a similar thing?!

74
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,149
Let speak to me in Ice-Ossan!

75
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,380
Drop, pirate!

76
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,240
The new one already made it tower of the city.

77
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,560
You cannot hide any more.

78
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,740
We will massacre all your crew!

79
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,080
Galley it Company! Find to them all!

80
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,659
What is there, Straw hat?

81
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,630
You intend to dodge still a long time?

82
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,790
I said it to you, I do not have any reason to fight against you!

83
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,510
It is known that the firearms do not have any effect on you…

84
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,650
Shit. They do not seem to make seeming!

85
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,240
Aimed well!

86
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,650
Not, it is to escape!

87
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,510
It was less one.

88
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,580
Oh not! I cannot move any more!

89
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,559
Luffy!

90
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,590
Yosha! They had it!

91
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,330
Ouais! One recognizes the pride of Galley well it Company!

92
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,309
One feels well.

93
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,340
Ouais, they do not have the right to finish some with him.

94
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,960
Not, not, not.

95
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,440
This merdeux of Straw hat is the worst enemy of Franky Family.

96
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,180
I at the origin of this combat, isn't this is?

97
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,570
Then how much time should I repeat you…

98
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,390
NOT TO TOUCH WITH MY ENEMY?!

99
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,999
GALLEY it!

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,689
Wait a little!

101
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,329
One will deal with you when one finishes some with him!

102
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,760
But why try you to catch my enemy?!

103
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,029
Not, that is not used for nothing. You do not include/understand anything.

104
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,219
Paulie, pay attention!

105
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,829
Galley it, flee!

106
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,550
Franky prepares a dirty blow!

107
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Connector set. [Established Connection]

108
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,379
It destroyed the large crane like that presently!

109
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,040
The crane?

110
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,559
It is a gun?

111
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,590
Flee, Galley it!

112
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,400
In you to play, Aniki!

113
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,289
Oh not, it is not a boulet de canon.

114
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,099
I will send a ball of air to you.

115
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,510
But even faster than the wind.

116
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,670
Air?

117
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,640
They is dangerous! Flee!

118
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,950
What?

119
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,790
STRONG GALE

120
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,819
Oh, it was what?!

121
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,370
One was made reverse by the power of the wind!

122
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,579
Another crane is reversed!

123
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,530
Will run! It will crumble here!

124
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,299
Quickly!

125
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,780
Caution!

126
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,550
Ouais, and here!

127
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,530
The stolen dock n°1 in glares!

128
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,099
It is which this guy?

129
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,029
From where does this technology cyborg come to him?

130
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,080
It was what this odd gun?

131
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,860
But…

132
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,590
Thanks to that, I could escape to me.

133
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,189
Nami, course!

134
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,290
LUFFY!

135
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,410
Does Ca go?

136
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,560
It is necessary some more to beat me.

137
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,830
In any event, I do not include/understand anything.

138
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,399
One must found Ice-Ossan.

139
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,279
What? Be serious for you?

140
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,850
One will never arrive there in all this row!

141
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,369
Oi, look at!

142
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,259
Straw hat escapes!

143
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,549
One is badly.

144
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,300
One is encircled.

145
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,180
Nami.

146
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,709
Cling well to me!

147
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,860
Wait!

148
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,580
Do not let them flee!

149
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,899
They escape!

150
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,310
Let us follow them!

151
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,390
I do not see it.

152
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,520
It cannot surely still not move.

153
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,420
There but one can remain without nothing to make.

154
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,190
Are Chopper, you ready?

155
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,130
Oi! Oi! The high tide Aqua Laguna is in way!

156
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,399
Ouais, ouais! This evening to midnight, the city will be submerged not water!

157
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,569
The shore also will be found completely submerged!

158
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,159
It is horrible! One cannot remain there!

159
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,739
Ouais! Ouais! One cannot remain there!

160
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,719
We must find a refuge in height!

161
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,309
Ouais! Ouais!

162
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,699
Let us find a refuge, quickly!

163
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,839
Refuge! Refuge!

164
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,430
Refuge! Refuge!

165
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,880
Refuge! Refuge!

166
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,980
One breaks!

167
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,470
It was what this din?

168
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,329
You must find a refuge.

169
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,420
Find a refuge, Usopp!

170
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,770
A high tide or a trick like that…

171
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,820
Moreover, the wind blows extremely…

172
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,350
Aniki…

173
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,540
They flee. You do not continue them?

174
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,320
Ah, after such a Strong gale, I am exhausted.

175
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,019
Look at my hairstyle!

176
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,560
One would say the branches of a tree, floating with the wind

177
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,849
If these guys had also not stopped me…

178
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,630
When I take again forces, I will eliminate it.

179
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,330
This reward of 100 million does not astonish me. It is very strong.

180
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,259
Good! I do not manage to believe that this dumb of Franky did that!

181
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,349
Which day.

182
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,960
At all events, we should not let them escape.

183
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,620
Aqua Laguna arrives this evening.

184
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,970
With share two remaining trains of the sea….

185
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,609
It is possible no to escape from the island.

186
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,870
Because they cannot use their boat.

187
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,200
Let us find them.

188
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,480
Let us divide the craftsmen of Galley it through all the island.

189
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,230
And all will be arranged before laying down it sun.

190
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,670
Grandmother! Grandmother! It is Water 7.

191
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,570
Made attention not fall into the ocean.

192
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,600
Here offices of Galley it Company.

193
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,349

196
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,800
The carpenters also gathered.

197
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,700
Iceberg-san is inside this fortress.

198
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,570
You want to go really there?

199
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,320
Of course.

200
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,380
I will ask directly Ice-ossan why he shows Robin.

201
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,190
Do not forget that we are pursued in all the island.

202
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,239
We must seek in which room Iceberg is.

203
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,910
Then we will have to find an opening and discreetly…

204
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,810
Then, I go there.

205
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,169
Wait!

206
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,730
He is untraceable.

207
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,730
It is which?!

208
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,380

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,990
It was what that?!

210
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,119
The window broke!

211
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,610

212
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,239

213
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,199

214
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,880
It penetrated the offices!

215
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,409

217
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,560
Where is it?

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,219
Take the staircases to the third stage!

219
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,969
Where are the engineers?

220
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,629
They seek on the island with the craftsmen.

221
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,150
They left all!

222
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,919

223
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,160

Baka! No firearms!

228
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,849
Do not draw!

229
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,450
You disturb Iceberg-san!

230
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,250
Please excuse me. It is bruillant outside.

231
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,570
Is Naaa, it what?

232
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,320
Luffy with the straw hat penetrated the fortress.

233
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,000
Kalifa, I have a thing to ask you.

234
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,799
Here it is!

235
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,260
Whore!

236
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,490
Y' has too much of it!

237
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,710
It jumped on the second building! Go ahead!

238
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,080

239
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,560
You are…

240
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,900
Did Kalifa-san, the pirate come by here?

241
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,109
Not, it did not come.

242
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,790
On this subject, continue it in silence please.

243
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,530
Iceberg-san still rests.

244
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,130
Excuse us.

245
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,739
Straw hat did not arrive yet.

246
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,209
Let us protect this zone.

247
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,650
It does not move inevitably there!

248
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,180
Did Naaa, you want to speak to me, pirate young person?

249
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,990
Yes. Thanks for having made me come.

250
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,159
You nevertheless did not come to kill me?

251
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
I came to know the truth!

252
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,560
Last night, I saw Nico Robin of my own eyes.

253
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,660
And it is a member of your crew. Here is the truth.

254
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,719
It is impossible… It was really Robin?!

255
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,370
Keep silent yourself.

256
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,310
You do not inspire confidence to me.

257
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,250
If I made you call, it is because I have a thing to ask you.

258
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,500
Let meet Nico Robin once again to me.

259
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,879
Breaking news!

260
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,739
Culprits in the attack of Iceberg-san…

261
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,400
is the crew of Straw hat!

262
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,830
Soon in the Mizu-Mizu newspaper, the accounts of eyewitnesses!

263
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,300
The culprits are on this island!

264
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,300
Find the crew, and hang them!

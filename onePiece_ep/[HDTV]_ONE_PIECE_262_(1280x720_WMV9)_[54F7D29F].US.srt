1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,290
I am Capitaine of the Q.G of the Navy!

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,070
I will leave you this life of disgrace!

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,550
I will slice you into two to stop you!

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,230
That will not arrive.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,590
Because the place which we want to reach…

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,620
is far behind you!

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,020
APPROACHES!!

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,350
I hate the indirect combat!!

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,390
** TECHNICAL ** Chokkaku Hichou!

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,270
** TECHNICAL ** Santouryuu Gyuuki

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,940
** TECHNICAL ** Bone Oudori!

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,580
It cut it!?

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,680
** TECHNICAL ** Yuuzume!

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,040
Roronoa!

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,400
It overcame trenching boat!

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,350
To run since the taken down coaches,

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,840
to catch up with Umi Ressha by this storm,

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,030
is admirable.

19
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,050
But nothing will stop us.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,140
Your justice is certainly imposing,

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,660
But also let us have we a strong motivation.

22
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,390
Sha! When one has that mouth, one finishes like that.

23
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,530
Sift!! You are sure not to be to you made berner by this woman?

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,720
She betrayed, and still betrayed, in the world of darkness where she lived until today. The worst of the women.

25
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,490
Your life is with me!

26
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,460
** TECHNICAL ** Cutting!!

27
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,410
What would you say to say some words of good-bye, frangin?

28
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,390
** TECHNICAL ** Ultimate Hammer!!

29
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,780
From where you come, you?

30
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,070
You finished other noodle?

31
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,410
Yes, at the moment.

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,920
It became quite noisy suddenly…

33
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,800
Were all the soldiers of escort beaten?

34
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,490
One did not expect any better them…

35
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,610
Then it is them… which removed Robin-chan.

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,040
Pay to, they use odd techniques.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,980
It is which that one?

38
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,840
It is surely the new recruit of the CP 9 about which Corgi spoke.

39
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,990
I believe that it is called Nero and used four styles.

40
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,030
Shit…

41
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,080
You will pay it to me, sho… one calls me the wonder of the combat…

42
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,540
I have of it more anything to make…

43
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,660
I will kill you!

44
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,080
Oi, the new one!

45
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,140
You are Rob Lucci, not true?

46
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,330
It is a little late for the greetings…

47
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,550
Wait a little, I will kill this type…

48
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,860
Franky must be captured alive.

49
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,530
To let your emotions affect your mission…

50
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,260
Not, drops.

51
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,560
I give you three seconds, then starts to run.

52
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,820
Three

53
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,410
To run? Which?

54
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,320
Two

55
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,860
, You wait pleasant?!

56
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,850
One.

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,800
Stop! Do not talk cock!

58
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:00,360
The rescue of Robin! The clever plan of Sogeking!

59
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,090
I give you three seconds, then starts to run.

60
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,290
Three

61
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,880
To run? Which?

62
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,010
Two.

63
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,300
, You wait pleasant?!

64
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,360
One

65
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,100
Stop! Do not talk cock!

66
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,020
** TECHNICAL ** Soru!

67
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,030
Somebody with half involved, like you…

68
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,620
its place does not have among the CP9!

69
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,790
We are superhuman because we control Rokushiki, kid.

70
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,460
Kalifa.

71
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,310
Yes?

72
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,830
Later you will transmit this to the chief…

73
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,910
“The new recruit was too weak, it was used for nothing.”

74
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,170
Included/understood.

75
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,330
It is guy fight for justice?

76
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,860
Who are the malicious ones here?

77
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,080
The government officials have really bad manners.

78
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,570
It is my duty.

79
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,050
You see, my nose does not mislead me, Nico Robin!

80
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,130
Why wouldn't you remove this coat?

81
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,500
Then? Then?  Then?!

82
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,830
Is shit… it the end?

83
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,800
Wait!

84
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,240
My name is Sogeking.

85
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,650
I am that which comes from the island of the snipeurs.

86
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,160
Soge?

87
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,700
, You wait really believe to be able to draw you with that?

88
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,700
Yes! Do not look at a high somebody who is prepared with going until there…

89
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,110
LUCCI-SAN!!!

90
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,270
What you made here… I make fun about it too much for you to ask it, intruder.

91
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Considering how you opened the door…

92
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,150
It would seem that you are rather impatient…

93
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,510
Ouais, I was badly high.

94
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,360
Drop Nico Robin.

95
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,430
What occurs here is too large for you.

96
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,800
In this world, there are people who were born under an unlucky star…

97
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,540
whose death would only make people happier.

98
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,190
About what you do speak?

99
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,100
For example:

100
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,890
If there was a demon able to destroy the world,

101
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,730
And even if the only person able to awake it…

102
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,170
is only one eight years innocent little girl.

103
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,230
You do not think…

104
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,430
that this young girl…

105
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,630
should be killed for the good of all?

106
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,950
Where do you want to come from there?

107
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,110
I speak to you about the life of this woman, Nico Robin.

108
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,380
Now, it is true criminal.

109
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,460
But at the beginning, it was only that.

110
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,250
At the moment when it came in the world,

111
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,980
its existence even became a crime.

112
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,080
It carries such a burden that only its death would make people happy…

113
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,880
Logically, it should have died twenty years ago.

114
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,870
The fact that this woman dies,

115
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,580
is really a good thing.

116
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,730
Stop your is delirious!!

117
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,480
Jerk!

118
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,700
Do not open any more your mouth!

119
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,310
Only, the government surely will take several years,

120
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,930
to extract all knowledge and the experiment from Nico Robin.

121
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,650
Finally, how atrocious you she will die?

122
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,260
Think there seriously

123
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,200
I WILL NOT LET TO YOU MAKE CA!!!

124
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,930
Oi, oi, wait, Robin!

125
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,040
Do not go by there…

126
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,480
Serious, wait!

127
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,790
Oi! Wait!

128
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,010
Robin-chan!

129
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,090
They is not good…

130
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,120
God thank you! You are well? You are not wounded?

131
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,950
It is not true…

132
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,440
Whereas I had succeeded in infiltrating me up to now and to cut down this agent.

133
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,120
It is it Nico Robin?

134
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,750
It really resembles the portrait on the research opinion…

135
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,640
 This time, let us find the others together!

136
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,550
I will smash these quickly made guy!

137
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,480
Of agreement? Robin-chan!

138
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,520
Usopp! But what do you make, Robin-chan?

139
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,450
It would seem that the words… are useless with you.

140
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,100
What do you make, Robin-chan?

141
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,460
It would seem that the words… are useless with you.

142
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,360
Franky-kun!

143
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,960
Take down the third car!

144
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,810
Why make?

145
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,210
TO FLEE!

146
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,550
To flee?

147
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,180
Do Oi, what you want to say?

148
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Dispatches too! Ca will be played in one moment.

149
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,130
Do not let Franky escape!

150
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,430
Yes.

151
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,430
** TECHNICAL ** Sogeking Smoke Star!

152
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,230
What a stupid gesture!

153
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,300
I have Nico Robin!

154
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,360
Wait…

155
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,450
Let me leave!

156
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,130
Yosha!

157
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,920
One bars oneself!

158
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:10,100
SPLASHES!!! 

Note:Kaeru = frog or verb “to return”, from where ambiguity.

159
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,330
Oi, it says that one returns.

160
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,100
REALLY? It IS WELL!

161
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,840
Well, one must prepare to make half-turn.

162
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,190
 OUAIS.

163
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,160
HEIN?!!

164
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,190
Why?! At the point where one is!

165
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,870
And for Robin? And Usopp? What will one make?
What will one make? What will one make?

166
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
Hm? It is the hour to puff out?

167
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,430
Does this idiot, of what it think?

168
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,290
DOES MUGIWARA, WHY ONE HAVE TO RETURN?

169
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,840
Mugiwara-san!

170
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,840
It is true that! Say to us why!

171
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,750
BUT NOT!!

172
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,730
Hein?

173
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,800
THIS FROG…

174
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,640
WITH CHANGE ON…

175
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,580
RAILS!!

176
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,170
Yokozuna!

177
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,810
He?

178
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,580
It is what this giant frog?

179
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,270
Pay to! Release from there, frog!

180
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,090
One will strike you!

181
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,430
One succeeded! Robin was recovered!

182
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,790
Which surprise, being able to make a plan of escape so quickly.

183
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,200
One écran de fumée is so useless usually that I would not have thought of it.

184
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,670
Against this kind of guy…

185
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,350
Most important is succeedto have succeeded
our mission without of having had to fight…

186
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,480
But…

187
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,430
I do not know if that will be so simple.

188
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,010
Ouais, until coaches 
are completely moved away, remain careful.

189
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,550
What?

190
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,920
A whip with points?

191
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,490
I have them, Blueno.

192
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,680
Well.

193
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,260
They want to cross?

194
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,160
They draw us towards them!!

195
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,450
Which force…

196
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,010
Écran de fumée was really useless…

197
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,390
I suspected that would not go…

198
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,040
Do not kill anybody of the crew of Mugiwara!

199
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,970
We have a market.

200
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,170
Sogeking.

201
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,180
 Yes?

202
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,950
Protect Robin-chan with the danger from your life!

203
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,190
Hein? … Yes!

204
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,100
You will owe us…

205
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
let leave!

206
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,750
Why it is so hard?

207
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,540
I had said to you that they had odd techniques!

208
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,800
** TECHNICAL ** Crushes!

209
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,140
A rather powerful kick…

210
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,130
It almost broke its Tekkai.

211
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,360
Blueno, does not underestimate it.

212
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,410
It does not have a premium, but it is one
the their strongest combatants.

213
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,500
You just come from you to give of it an account, band of dumbs?

214
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,840
R- R-Robin, Have-HAVE-HAVe-Await!

215
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,970
Qu-Qu'est-ce-que you

216
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,950
** TECHNICAL ** Ocho Fleur!

217
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,430
** TECHNICAL ** Clutch!

218
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,060
Length-conk!

219
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,100
P-Pourquoi, Robin-chan?

220
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,180
Combiens of time should I say it to you? 
Leave me quiet!

221
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,140
It is…

222
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,130
Do Eho, where you look at?

223
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,640
Twisted eyebrows!

224
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,060
Bong blood, you then. Ones like the others…

225
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,020
Why are you if limited when they are your comrades?

226
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,980
This is not there…

227
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,460
a single chance to escape to you?!

228
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,140
Franky!

229
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,130
What you interfere yourself…

230
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,370
You sought it!

231
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,650
And initially why do you help these guy?

232
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,470
I cannot remain to look at a team if welded to be separate their dreams.

233
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,040
I wonder who you speak…

234
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,560
Ow! The guy, you of made not for me! I have a plan!

235
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,220
Once you will be with Straw hat, clear up you for turn over downtown!

236
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,590
Franky!

237
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,390
Wait!

238
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,590
I do not seek to flee!

239
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,040
Wait, Robin-chan…

240
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,920
Why you continuous say that?

241
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,690
We had just saved with full knowledge of the facts.

242
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,920
We will find something
for Buster Cal of the government,

243
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,330
thus Robin-chan you do not have any more any reason to want to remain with them!

244
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,650
Buster Cal…

245
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,090
is precisely the problem.

1
00:01: 55,680 --> 00:01: 57,239
In search of great adventures,

2
00:01: 57,240 --> 00:02: 01,490
Luffy and its crew have finally
reached the celestial island, Skypiea.

3
00:02: 06,030 --> 00:02: 10,780
At this point in time Nami and the others are
removed to undergo the Celestial Judgment.

4
00:02: 10,780 --> 00:02: 16,550
Thus, guided by Conis, Luffy and the remainder of the crew took the direction of the island of God, Upper Yard.

5
00:02: 17,770 --> 00:02: 19,370
The Small Corbel!

6
00:02: 20,780 --> 00:02: 22,819
It is a joke?!

7
00:02: 22,820 --> 00:02: 24,320
A corbel…?

8
00:02: 25,250 --> 00:02: 26,970
It is not a bird which goes on water.

9
00:02: 27,120 --> 00:02: 29,579
You can leave it
port by the door number 2.

10
00:02: 29,580 --> 00:02: 33,620
You will lead to Milky
Road which leads to Upper Yard.

11
00:02: 35,350 --> 00:02: 37,540
It is enough for you to follow it.

12
00:02: 40,390 --> 00:02: 42,340
He, Conis.

13
00:02: 42,810 --> 00:02: 43,670
Yes?

14
00:02: 43,730 --> 00:02: 47,310
Why you tremble like that
since one did leave at home?

15
00:02: 48,980 --> 00:02: 51,689
Please,
forgive me, Conis-san!

16
00:02: 51,690 --> 00:02: 54,649
It is the duty of our people!

17
00:02: 54,650 --> 00:02: 56,580
Do you want to escape to you well from here?

18
00:02: 57,700 --> 00:03: 01,900
That which called Lobster
Super Express train… It was me!

19
00:03: 02,270 --> 00:03: 05,409
If criminals are met, one is
obliged to lead them to the Earth of the Judgment.

20
00:03: 05,410 --> 00:03: 08,840
Or if not we are killed!

21
00:03: 21,480 --> 00:03: 23,910
I am happy, Conis-chan!

22
00:03: 27,020 --> 00:03: 30,400
I know who you are.

23
00:03: 31,320 --> 00:03: 33,040
Return us, please…

24
00:03: 33,270 --> 00:03: 34,790
God.

25
00:03: 35,230 --> 00:03: 44,250
Ahead, Small Corbel!
On the way for the Sacrificial Furnace bridge

26
00:03: 44,830 --> 00:03: 47,479
Will all go well for Conis?

27
00:03: 47,480 --> 00:03: 51,300
It is criminal now
since it tried to help us.

28
00:03: 51,300 --> 00:03: 53,989
Perhaps that it will not be able
to live whole here more.

29
00:03: 53,990 --> 00:03: 57,460
This old Knight of the Sky said
that it would take care of it, but…

30
00:03: 57,460 --> 00:04: 00,779
Ben, this Papi odd does not have
air to be a bad type.

31
00:04: 00,780 --> 00:04: 02,499
There are not an other choice
to trust him.

32
00:04: 02,500 --> 00:04: 05,759
I would have liked to protect it myself, but
one did not can have taken it with us.

33
00:04: 05,760 --> 00:04: 09,360
Ouais, it is still
more dangerous with us.

34
00:04: 09,360 --> 00:04: 12,049
One goes to the Sacrificial Furnace bridge.

35
00:04: 12,050 --> 00:04: 15,960
And of terrible Ordalies
we wait there.

36
00:04: 15,960 --> 00:04: 18,679
It does not advance this tub!

37
00:04: 18,680 --> 00:04: 22,220
This boat is much
heavier than Waver.

38
00:04: 22,220 --> 00:04: 23,720
Stop feeling sorry for you!

39
00:04: 27,640 --> 00:04: 28,539
He, look at!

40
00:04: 28,540 --> 00:04: 29,369
What?!

41
00:04: 29,370 --> 00:04: 30,879
It is what this immense forest?!

42
00:04: 30,880 --> 00:04: 32,529
It is surely Upper Yard.

43
00:04: 32,530 --> 00:04: 33,499
TERRIBLE!

44
00:04: 33,500 --> 00:04: 35,539
Did Y have this forest on the chart?

45
00:04: 35,540 --> 00:04: 41,500
Euh, Ben… There is a forest on
chart, but it is not so large.

46
00:04: 41,500 --> 00:04: 42,870
Just a normal forest.

47
00:04: 42,890 --> 00:04: 46,400
The type which had this chart
was there two hundred years ago.

48
00:04: 46,400 --> 00:04: 49,439
It is even possible that this chart was already
old woman. (that it was already old at the time)

49
00:04: 49,440 --> 00:04: 53,210
I would say that it takes at least thousand years
so that trees become so large.

50
00:04: 53,900 --> 00:04: 54,839
It is true…

51
00:04: 54,840 --> 00:04: 58,050
They are so immense!

52
00:04: 58,900 --> 00:05: 00,109
I want to climb one of them.

53
00:05: 00,110 --> 00:05: 03,990
[The kanji? (kami) “God means”.]

54
00:05: 05,200 --> 00:05: 06,139
It is the entry!

55
00:05: 06,140 --> 00:05: 08,529
Very well, if we want
to move back, it is now or never.

56
00:05: 08,530 --> 00:05: 10,270
You ace interest to be ready, Usopp.

57
00:05: 10,910 --> 00:05: 13,439
A-Alors if possible,
I would like to retrogress…

58
00:05: 13,440 --> 00:05: 14,189
ALLONS-Y!

59
00:05: 14,190 --> 00:05: 16,190
You me listenings not!

60
00:05: 40,700 --> 00:05: 41,849
I it has something by there there!

61
00:05: 41,850 --> 00:05: 43,349
Ben, it is a forest.

62
00:05: 43,350 --> 00:05: 44,659
Ouais, it is true.

63
00:05: 44,660 --> 00:05: 45,939
Have-await one second, the guy.

64
00:05: 45,940 --> 00:05: 47,429
Look around us!

65
00:05: 47,430 --> 00:05: 49,189
They are wrecks!

66
00:05: 49,190 --> 00:05: 50,519
Ben, it is a forest!

67
00:05: 50,520 --> 00:05: 51,619
Ouais, it is true.

68
00:05: 51,620 --> 00:05: 53,229
Ca does not have anything to see!

69
00:05: 53,230 --> 00:05: 56,820
Moreover, all these boats
were crossed into two…

70
00:05: 57,170 --> 00:05: 58,379
E-Encore this noise.

71
00:05: 58,380 --> 00:06: 00,329
You see, there are several
types of forests…

72
00:06: 00,330 --> 00:06: 01,350
Not, it is not that!

73
00:06: 01,670 --> 00:06: 02,629
TAKE THE OARS!

74
00:06: 02,630 --> 00:06: 03,489
USE THE OARS! BROTHEL!

75
00:06: 03,490 --> 00:06: 04,219
ROW, GOOD BLOOD!

76
00:06: 04,220 --> 00:06: 05,359
LET US MOVE FROM HERE!

77
00:06: 05,360 --> 00:06: 06,850
Hein? Which fly pricks you?

78
00:06: 12,870 --> 00:06: 14,399
A monstrous scythe!

79
00:06: 14,400 --> 00:06: 16,520
DO NOT REMAIN PLANT
! IN HERE ANOTHER!

80
00:06: 18,910 --> 00:06: 21,310
Not… Not that only one…

81
00:06: 23,800 --> 00:06: 26,560
ROW AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN IT!!

82
00:06: 34,640 --> 00:06: 37,990
Q - What
brothel occurs?!

83
00:06: 40,130 --> 00:06: 41,619
Attention in front! Slow down, Luffy, quickly!

84
00:06: 41,620 --> 00:06: 42,629
Shit, one will never arrive there!

85
00:06: 42,630 --> 00:06: 44,009
Take the bar, Usopp!

86
00:06: 44,010 --> 00:06: 44,869
Gomu Gomu No…

87
00:06: 44,870 --> 00:06: 46,999
What you make Luffy
? You should aim by there!

88
00:06: 47,000 --> 00:06: 48,690
Occupy you! Straight goes!

89
00:06: 48,750 --> 00:06: 51,160
BAZOOKA!

90
00:06: 52,440 --> 00:06: 53,329
One succeeded!

91
00:06: 53,330 --> 00:06: 55,460
OF ACCURACY!

92
00:07: 01,360 --> 00:07: 02,890
There is still?

93
00:07: 06,780 --> 00:07: 08,310
What still?!

94
00:07: 09,350 --> 00:07: 10,449
USOPP, ON THE RIGHT!

95
00:07: 10,450 --> 00:07: 11,249
Not, on the left!

96
00:07: 11,250 --> 00:07: 12,059
Where I go?!

97
00:07: 12,060 --> 00:07: 13,510
Be satisfied to avoid them!

98
00:07: 19,410 --> 00:07: 20,439
Ca never stops!

99
00:07: 20,440 --> 00:07: 22,379
One still will be touched!

100
00:07: 22,380 --> 00:07: 24,179
Ca inflates me! I go
all to stop them!

101
00:07: 24,180 --> 00:07: 27,130
[Note: Kazaguruma = Winch]

102
00:07: 30,950 --> 00:07: 32,449
One passed.

103
00:07: 32,450 --> 00:07: 36,110
I hope that it is finished, brothel.

104
00:07: 41,080 --> 00:07: 42,260
It is what that?

105
00:07: 43,960 --> 00:07: 45,069
It is a boomerang!

106
00:07: 45,070 --> 00:07: 46,210
Shit!

107
00:07: 48,010 --> 00:07: 49,309
IT RETURNS!

108
00:07: 49,310 --> 00:07: 50,770
FLEE QUICKLY!

109
00:07: 54,370 --> 00:07: 58,730
This dumb of special-express train
we just released here.

110
00:07: 58,730 --> 00:08: 01,040
Which is this place?

111
00:08: 01,520 --> 00:08: 06,110
All that one knows, they is that one
find some share in Upper Yard.

112
00:08: 07,050 --> 00:08: 10,279
A Sacrificial Furnace bridge well would be said.

113
00:08: 10,280 --> 00:08: 12,780
A Furnace bridge… Sacrificial?

114
00:08: 13,370 --> 00:08: 15,499
Is Nami, it what a sacrifice?

115
00:08: 15,500 --> 00:08: 17,999
It is when one offers
alive things with God.

116
00:08: 18,000 --> 00:08: 19,769
Is Oh, it all?

117
00:08: 19,770 --> 00:08: 22,769
I thought that one went
to make me boil alive.

118
00:08: 22,770 --> 00:08: 25,430
It IS HOT!!

119
00:08: 25,990 --> 00:08: 28,380
But, it is almost that.

120
00:08: 28,670 --> 00:08: 32,170
Whatever the method, our lives
nevertheless will be offered to God.

121
00:08: 32,170 --> 00:08: 35,950
WHAT?! THEN ONE WILL BE KILL?!

122
00:08: 37,250 --> 00:08: 38,820
Chopper!

123
00:08: 38,970 --> 00:08: 40,430
Brothel.

124
00:08: 56,160 --> 00:08: 57,669
It is what that?!

125
00:08: 57,670 --> 00:08: 58,489
A shark.

126
00:08: 58,490 --> 00:08: 59,569
A shark in the sky.

127
00:08: 59,570 --> 00:09: 01,020
It is a celestial shark.

128
00:09: 02,520 --> 00:09: 03,420
ZORO!

129
00:09: 03,910 --> 00:09: 06,020
ZORO!!

130
00:09: 15,490 --> 00:09: 18,710
Bad visibility…
Where did it pass?

131
00:09: 31,270 --> 00:09: 33,029
It is risky.

132
00:09: 33,030 --> 00:09: 36,470
I cannot use my
force as on the dry land.

133
00:09: 49,710 --> 00:09: 51,330
Shit! Shit! Shit!

134
00:09: 52,740 --> 00:09: 53,920
It missed us!

135
00:09: 55,110 --> 00:09: 56,590
It returns!

136
00:10: 01,050 --> 00:10: 03,749
It does not matter the number of lives that one
has! This place will be our tomb!

137
00:10: 03,750 --> 00:10: 05,269
I MAKE HALF-TURN AND ONE from GOES AWAY!

138
00:10: 05,270 --> 00:10: 06,289
NOT, USOPP!

139
00:10: 06,290 --> 00:10: 07,189
THE FARM!

140
00:10: 07,190 --> 00:10: 08,979
I AM THE CAPTAIN OF THE SMALL CORBEL!

141
00:10: 08,980 --> 00:10: 10,119
One decided that when?!

142
00:10: 10,120 --> 00:10: 11,329
JUST NOW!

143
00:10: 11,330 --> 00:10: 15,110
The trick it is that one cannot
not to even return if it is wished.

144
00:10: 15,110 --> 00:10: 16,160
Look at.

145
00:10: 19,180 --> 00:10: 20,999
IT RETURNS!

146
00:10: 21,000 --> 00:10: 22,869
Good, I have enough of it!

147
00:10: 22,870 --> 00:10: 23,889
Gomu Gomu No…

148
00:10: 23,890 --> 00:10: 24,529
What?!

149
00:10: 24,530 --> 00:10: 25,750
Go ahead Luffy!

150
00:10: 27,340 --> 00:10: 28,790
I cannot touch it.

151
00:10: 31,520 --> 00:10: 32,899
In any event, let us avoid it!

152
00:10: 32,900 --> 00:10: 34,630
Is not better to put itself on its road!

153
00:10: 43,960 --> 00:10: 45,670
I believe that one finally succeeded.

154
00:10: 46,790 --> 00:10: 48,029
But what does one make now?

155
00:10: 48,030 --> 00:10: 49,899
One cannot any more
to retrogress…

156
00:10: 49,900 --> 00:10: 52,079
One moved away too much from the entry.

157
00:10: 52,080 --> 00:10: 53,169
You want that one unloads here?

158
00:10: 53,170 --> 00:10: 54,959
MORON! ONE WILL DIE!

159
00:10: 54,960 --> 00:10: 56,380
One would say well.

160
00:11: 03,060 --> 00:11: 03,889
It is what?

161
00:11: 03,890 --> 00:11: 04,870
A snake?

162
00:11: 05,070 --> 00:11: 06,239
It is a lamprey!

163
00:11: 06,240 --> 00:11: 08,179
Or perhaps a celestial lamprey.

164
00:11: 08,180 --> 00:11: 11,420
Considering its size, it would not make
not that to suck our blood!

165
00:11: 12,230 --> 00:11: 14,029
It is cool, this forest!

166
00:11: 14,030 --> 00:11: 15,559
There are nothing cool here!

167
00:11: 15,560 --> 00:11: 18,029
All that one meets
here tries to kill us!

168
00:11: 18,030 --> 00:11: 20,250
But one hardly has just arrived.

169
00:11: 20,530 --> 00:11: 22,349
As long as one is on Milky Road…

170
00:11: 22,350 --> 00:11: 26,040
if one stops to take again our breath,
one will find oneself in a beautiful kneader.

171
00:11: 26,040 --> 00:11: 28,459
Our only possibility
is to continue to advance.

172
00:11: 28,460 --> 00:11: 32,260
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

173
00:11: 35,550 --> 00:11: 39,850
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

174
00:11: 55,240 --> 00:11: 57,109
What occurred?

175
00:11: 57,110 --> 00:11: 58,620
Zoro…

176
00:12: 08,760 --> 00:12: 09,949
Here it is!

177
00:12: 09,950 --> 00:12: 10,839
Zoro!

178
00:12: 10,840 --> 00:12: 13,390
THE CELESTIAL SHARK WILL BEAT ZORO!

179
00:12: 25,610 --> 00:12: 29,080
I they replongé…

180
00:12: 29,720 --> 00:12: 32,359
ZORO DOES NOT REMAKE SURFACE!

181
00:12: 32,360 --> 00:12: 35,490
It… was not done
to eat, isn't?

182
00:12: 36,420 --> 00:12: 38,729
ZORO WAS DEVOURS!

183
00:12: 38,730 --> 00:12: 41,379
If he had been eaten, them
clouds would have become red.

184
00:12: 41,380 --> 00:12: 44,089
WHY IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SAY
SUCH MORBID TRICKS, ROBIN?!

185
00:12: 44,090 --> 00:12: 48,460
CA IS ENOUGH!!

186
00:13: 04,740 --> 00:13: 06,649
Brothel.

187
00:13: 06,650 --> 00:13: 10,019
Is necessary to believe that one cannot
to escape from here from the stroke.

188
00:13: 10,020 --> 00:13: 13,540
You gave a punch to
this shark, and you say yourself epeist.

189
00:13: 13,540 --> 00:13: 15,019
Zoro is too strong!

190
00:13: 15,020 --> 00:13: 17,789
What arrived
with your pride of epeist?

191
00:13: 17,790 --> 00:13: 19,970
Firm, woman!

192
00:13: 23,840 --> 00:13: 25,629
There was not one of them!

193
00:13: 25,630 --> 00:13: 27,949
Ca grouille of celestial sharks in bottom!

194
00:13: 27,950 --> 00:13: 31,360
If I must all face them, one there
to will have still fallen the night.

195
00:13: 31,360 --> 00:13: 33,479
One will never reach
the shore like that.

196
00:13: 33,480 --> 00:13: 36,930
Indeed. And we cannot
not to remain here indefinitely.

197
00:13: 39,270 --> 00:13: 41,619
It really misled us…

198
00:13: 41,620 --> 00:13: 43,240
This large lobster.

199
00:13: 43,650 --> 00:13: 47,240
Perhaps that the Celestial Judgment is
to let to us die of hunger here.

200
00:13: 47,460 --> 00:13: 50,809
You believe that God is satisfied
of such a sober punishment?

201
00:13: 50,810 --> 00:13: 53,770
I do not know. I
ever met.

202
00:13: 54,590 --> 00:13: 56,679
Ca really fears.

203
00:13: 56,680 --> 00:14: 00,090
With a hull in this state, one
cannot give it to water.

204
00:14: 00,730 --> 00:14: 03,249
While waiting, finds one
means of repairing it, Chopper.

205
00:14: 03,250 --> 00:14: 05,399
Hein? Me? Of agreement…

206
00:14: 05,400 --> 00:14: 06,929
To repair the boat?

207
00:14: 06,930 --> 00:14: 08,369
What do you intend to make?

208
00:14: 08,370 --> 00:14: 10,769
I will explore the forest.

209
00:14: 10,770 --> 00:14: 13,709
One should also consider this
place as our base for the moment.

210
00:14: 13,710 --> 00:14: 17,160
I am sure that Luffy and them
others are with our research.

211
00:14: 18,020 --> 00:14: 21,429
You know what one says: “If you
be lost, remain where you are! “

212
00:14: 21,430 --> 00:14: 23,520
It is you which should remain there!

213
00:14: 33,940 --> 00:14: 38,360
He, Zoro… You said that
suited you in this forest…

214
00:14: 38,360 --> 00:14: 40,390
But what you
accounts to make over there?

215
00:14: 40,710 --> 00:14: 42,799
Is God on this island, not true?

216
00:14: 42,800 --> 00:14: 43,729
I am curious to meet it.

217
00:14: 43,730 --> 00:14: 45,309
Stop that immediately!

218
00:14: 45,310 --> 00:14: 48,870
Why want you to meet
somebody of also powerful?!

219
00:14: 49,180 --> 00:14: 50,689
Who knows…

220
00:14: 50,690 --> 00:14: 52,729
Ca depends on its attitude.

221
00:14: 52,730 --> 00:14: 55,859
Zoro… is more arrogant than God.

222
00:14: 55,860 --> 00:14: 58,309
These Priests are on
this island, them too

223
00:14: 58,310 --> 00:15: 01,129
And you are not supposed
to attract you the lightnings of God!

224
00:15: 01,130 --> 00:15: 02,920
It is right good sense!

225
00:15: 06,030 --> 00:15: 07,610
Afflicted, I do not have…

226
00:15: 08,960 --> 00:15: 11,199
ever venerated of God.

227
00:15: 11,200 --> 00:15: 15,090
OHHH! TOO MUCH COOL!!

228
00:15: 15,400 --> 00:15: 19,310
I do not believe in a God, then why
should I make him prayers?

229
00:15: 20,210 --> 00:15: 24,630
Oh, Lord God, I
do not know this man.

230
00:15: 24,630 --> 00:15: 27,780
Please, me
do not punish with him!

231
00:15: 28,700 --> 00:15: 31,680
You TOO COOL ES, ZORO!

232
00:15: 36,260 --> 00:15: 37,799
Brothel…

233
00:15: 37,800 --> 00:15: 40,139
Does Ca thus finish any never?

234
00:15: 40,140 --> 00:15: 43,009
But it did not become yet exciting.

235
00:15: 43,010 --> 00:15: 48,650
These Priests over there must
to really want to test us!

236
00:15: 48,650 --> 00:15: 49,809
How that?

237
00:15: 49,810 --> 00:15: 53,110
You want to say that nobody was able
to reach Ordalies until now?

238
00:15: 53,220 --> 00:15: 58,330
Ouais, surely. You saw this enormous well
flash which fell down on the quay, not true?

239
00:15: 58,340 --> 00:15: 59,019
Ouais…

240
00:15: 59,020 --> 00:16: 02,910
I do not know which kind of artifice it has
used, but it was terribly powerful.

241
00:16: 02,910 --> 00:16: 05,219
If something of the kind falls us
above, one is made like rats.

242
00:16: 05,220 --> 00:16: 06,250
Ouais.

243
00:16: 06,660 --> 00:16: 09,879
This Eneru God… Nothing him is known.

244
00:16: 09,880 --> 00:16: 13,070
But it would be said that it us
observe since one is there.

245
00:16: 13,270 --> 00:16: 15,819
You want to say that God
was in this city?

246
00:16: 15,820 --> 00:16: 19,430
If it were not there, it did not can
to use this attack with as much precision.

247
00:16: 19,430 --> 00:16: 22,529
Not, not, not… I do not know
not… It is God, after all!

248
00:16: 22,530 --> 00:16: 25,029
Perhaps that it observed us…

249
00:16: 25,030 --> 00:16: 27,540
Perhaps even as it us
observe in this moment!

250
00:16: 27,810 --> 00:16: 30,939
Since when you are superstitious?

251
00:16: 30,940 --> 00:16: 33,129
You do not even live here.

252
00:16: 33,130 --> 00:16: 35,159
It is not that the problem.

253
00:16: 35,160 --> 00:16: 37,169
Somebody whom one calls
God must be very powerful.

254
00:16: 37,170 --> 00:16: 39,609
One is judicious to incline oneself
in front of this kind of guy.

255
00:16: 39,610 --> 00:16: 41,039
Even if it seriously is not done.

256
00:16: 41,040 --> 00:16: 42,520
Then you can speak to him.

257
00:16: 42,620 --> 00:16: 46,790
It is true. But there are other gods
in the world which is not so powerful.

258
00:16: 47,590 --> 00:16: 49,240
God of the poor.

259
00:16: 49,960 --> 00:16: 51,689
Or God of the bringers of ill-luck.

260
00:16: 51,690 --> 00:16: 53,140
WHICH YOU SPEAK?

261
00:16: 54,150 --> 00:16: 58,500
It would be said that while one sailed, our
next guests decided to come by front!

262
00:17: 01,760 --> 00:17: 04,500
STILL ONE!!

263
00:17: 07,670 --> 00:17: 10,169
It would be said that one can
to use this liana.

264
00:17: 10,170 --> 00:17: 12,390
Oh, yes. Good idea.

265
00:17: 12,440 --> 00:17: 15,230
Ca disturbs you if I accompany you,
Mister the swashbuckler?

266
00:17: 16,110 --> 00:17: 18,419
They is good, but task of
not to trail in my legs.

267
00:17: 18,420 --> 00:17: 19,339
Wait!

268
00:17: 19,340 --> 00:17: 21,509
Where you go, Robin?

269
00:17: 21,510 --> 00:17: 23,040
Look at that.

270
00:17: 23,770 --> 00:17: 27,900
This furnace bridge goes back to it there
is at least thousand years old.

271
00:17: 27,900 --> 00:17: 29,790
Thousand?

272
00:17: 30,130 --> 00:17: 35,030
Vestiges of a past
if moved back fascinate me.

273
00:17: 37,300 --> 00:17: 41,990
Place such an in charge of history
must hide a whole heap of relics.

274
00:17: 43,810 --> 00:17: 47,990
If one finds some spalls
invaluable, it will be very useful to our crew.

275
00:17: 49,430 --> 00:17: 51,059
I come too!

276
00:17: 51,060 --> 00:17: 51,559
WHAT?!

277
00:17: 51,560 --> 00:17: 53,600
YOU DID NOT SAY THAT YOU WERE AFRAID?!

278
00:17: 54,890 --> 00:17: 56,639
One will unearth a little history.

279
00:17: 56,640 --> 00:17: 58,260
Its eyes changed into Berrys…

280
00:18: 02,250 --> 00:18: 03,449
Will that be enough?

281
00:18: 03,450 --> 00:18: 05,050
It is perfect.

282
00:18: 18,210 --> 00:18: 19,639
It is what that?

283
00:18: 19,640 --> 00:18: 21,410
A cry of bravery?

284
00:18: 30,630 --> 00:18: 32,760
Robin is so cool!

285
00:18: 33,250 --> 00:18: 35,060
Ca with the easy air with it.

286
00:18: 38,710 --> 00:18: 41,160
It is a little high…

287
00:18: 41,370 --> 00:18: 44,459
There are approximately fifty
meters. If you tombs, you die.

288
00:18: 44,460 --> 00:18: 46,940
DECREE TO FRIGHTEN ME!

289
00:18: 52,310 --> 00:18: 54,970
It rightly. If I fall, it is foutu.

290
00:18: 55,540 --> 00:18: 56,810
Nami.

291
00:18: 57,040 --> 00:18: 59,039
Of agreement, they is good! I arrive!

292
00:18: 59,040 --> 00:19: 00,560
I go there!

293
00:19: 07,740 --> 00:19: 08,469
TOO MUCH FAST!

294
00:19: 08,470 --> 00:19: 09,329
It IS TOO FAST!

295
00:19: 09,330 --> 00:19: 10,850
I CANNOT STOP!

296
00:19: 13,670 --> 00:19: 15,270
Cheer, you have notch.

297
00:19: 17,590 --> 00:19: 20,040
Afflicted for all these troubles.

298
00:19: 20,100 --> 00:19: 21,600
It is nothing.

299
00:19: 23,060 --> 00:19: 24,269
Should to you have made the cry.

300
00:19: 24,270 --> 00:19: 26,390
It IS NOT CA the PROBLEM!

301
00:19: 28,540 --> 00:19: 31,050
This forest is really immense…

302
00:19: 33,510 --> 00:19: 35,849
Good, Chopper! The boat
is between your hands!

303
00:19: 35,850 --> 00:19: 36,989
One leaves it under your guard!

304
00:19: 36,990 --> 00:19: 38,319
One will be soon of return!

305
00:19: 38,320 --> 00:19: 39,069
Of agreement!

306
00:19: 39,070 --> 00:19: 43,160
Be careful, the guy
! And return in life!

307
00:19: 46,510 --> 00:19: 49,640
Nami is in safety with Zoro and Robin.

308
00:19: 50,260 --> 00:19: 52,720
Me I am too afraid to follow them.

309
00:19: 53,260 --> 00:19: 56,099
They all are so courageous!

310
00:19: 56,100 --> 00:19: 59,310
I hope that I will become
as brave man as them one day.

311
00:20: 04,630 --> 00:20: 08,290
In any case, now I
must just make my better.

312
00:20: 09,060 --> 00:20: 11,959
They left me only with
boat in a dangerous forest.

313
00:20: 11,960 --> 00:20: 15,600
Ca proves that they make me
confidence. I will work hard.

314
00:20: 16,610 --> 00:20: 20,240
Ouais! I am all alone
in this dangerous place…

315
00:20: 27,540 --> 00:20: 31,010
It IS ME WHICH AM MORE IN DANGER!

316
00:20: 33,740 --> 00:20: 35,540
ONE SE WILL MAKE PUFF OUT!

317
00:20: 35,620 --> 00:20: 39,790
He, you believe that this large trick in
good taste if one does cook it with the barbecue?

318
00:20: 39,790 --> 00:20: 43,590
Drop! How you want that
I cook in a similar place?

319
00:20: 44,250 --> 00:20: 47,410
Gomu Gomu No Pistol!

320
00:20: 57,680 --> 00:21: 01,290
The alarming celestial island…
the alarming celestial island…

321
00:21: 01,290 --> 00:21: 02,309
You want from to go away?

322
00:21: 02,310 --> 00:21: 03,539
MORON!

323
00:21: 03,540 --> 00:21: 07,290
I WILL BURST! It IS TERRIFYING
! LEAVE ME QUIET!

324
00:21: 09,500 --> 00:21: 11,910
A right giant in front!

325
00:21: 14,160 --> 00:21: 16,289
Not, it is a stone statue.

326
00:21: 16,290 --> 00:21: 19,369
He. Then, it is
a cul-de-sac?

327
00:21: 19,370 --> 00:21: 21,670
Not, there are four doors.

328
00:21: 23,610 --> 00:21: 27,700
Do not say to me that zlles carries out
very at different places?

329
00:21: 28,500 --> 00:21: 30,579
Ordalie of the Marshes.

330
00:21: 30,580 --> 00:21: 32,309
Ordalie of Iron.

331
00:21: 32,310 --> 00:21: 34,249
Ordalie of Wire.

332
00:21: 34,250 --> 00:21: 35,710
Ordalie of the Bubbles.

333
00:21: 36,380 --> 00:21: 38,599
One can take that which one wants!

334
00:21: 38,600 --> 00:21: 42,250
Then, God proposes a little game to us?

335
00:21: 46,480 --> 00:21: 48,390
Four Ordalies…

336
00:21: 49,650 --> 00:21: 51,460
Which goes one
to choose??

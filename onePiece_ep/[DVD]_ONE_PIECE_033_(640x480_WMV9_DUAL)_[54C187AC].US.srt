1
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,178
As usual, your reputation's pretty bad.

2
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:02,889
No surprise. I am pirate after all.

3
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:06,017
But Arlong understands me...

4
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,295
Just a little bit more and I can
fulfill my part of the bargain.

5
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,439
No matter what, I'll collect that 100 million beli...

6
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,233
No matter what, I'll collect that 100 million beli...

7
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,235
...and buy the village!

8
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:24,410
USOPP'S DEATH?!
LUFFY YET TO LAND?

9
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:24,536
USOPP'S DEATH?!
LUFFY YET TO LAND?

10
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:39,843
Go! To Arlong Park!

11
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,775
Wait for me! Nami!

12
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,042
Let go! Let me go!

13
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:14,377
Let go! Let me go!

14
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:19,382
Not yet? You still haven't caught
that long nosed guy?

15
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,264
A common human!? Dares
to challenge us mermen!?

16
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,269
We're returning. To Arlong Park...

17
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,452
Damn! I can't outrun them?

18
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:52,624
Where'd he go?

19
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,627
Anyone who thinks Usopp-sama shouldn't
die yet, should raise their hands now!

20
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,587
Anyone who thinks Usopp-sama shouldn't
die yet, should raise their hands now!

21
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:58,713
Yes!

22
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,257
Yes!

23
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:01,299
Yes!

24
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,052
Idiot! What is he thinking?

25
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,262
You people think so too eh?

26
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,472
Me too!

27
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,562
What?

28
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,066
Killing move!!

29
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:18,483
TAMAGOBOSHI!

30
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:18,983
TAMAGOBOSHI!

31
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:19,192
TAMAGOBOSHI!

32
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,783
It stinks! This sucks!

33
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,579
How's that!? Mermen aren't that great.

34
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,208
No matter what Captain Usopp will always escape!

35
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,003
Crap...

36
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,247
I wasn't aware I'd reached the beach already!

37
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,175
Come this way! We've got him!

38
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,265
There's nothing here.

39
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,307
Were we mistaken?

40
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:53,768
That guy does run really fast.

41
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,145
Lets look elsewhere.

42
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,735
Thank god...

43
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:04,904
I don't know!

44
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:09,492
Telling lies won't do you any good.

45
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,840
Huh? What? What the?

46
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:32,557
Thanks for cheering me on!
As you can see I'm fine...

47
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,687
Perhaps a little too fine?

48
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:39,856
That's true...

49
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,775
Too slow.

50
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,323
When's Luffy gonna come?

51
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,686
If he doesn't come in the next 5 minutes,
I'm going to die of boredom!

52
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:52,869
Oooh oooh oh! This one's awesome!

53
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,162
Oooh oooh oh! This one's awesome!

54
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,372
Oooh oooh oh! This one's awesome!

55
00:05:56,372 --> 00:06:01,169
Even I, a member of Arlong's elite,
Hachi-Hatchan can't pull it up.

56
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,338
It must be a super great fish!

57
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,219
I don't know from where you've come
but your gusto is East Blue's best...

58
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,055
Wh..What the? What?

59
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,890
Oh it was myself.

60
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:19,395
Truly, my gusto is East Blue's best.

61
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:20,522
Truly, my gusto is East BIue's best.

62
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,398
Anything strange?

63
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:23,858
Definitely strange.

64
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,278
Huh? Who the heck are you?

65
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,073
M-Me?

66
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:33,952
I'm Hatchan. Call me Hachi.

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,453
Are you a merman too?

68
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,872
Of course! Of course!

69
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,125
I'm a charming octopus merman.

70
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,335
Do I look like a human?

71
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:43,419
I guess not...

72
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,880
Are you with the Marines or just a guest?

73
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,215
Guest?

74
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,635
Yeah, I'm a guest.

75
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:52,846
But you know, Arlong-san's
not here right now, right?

76
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:54,514
Yeah. Where'd he go?

77
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:59,853
I heard that there was a long nosed stranger
that was trying to run away.

78
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,522
They say another one was caught
and held here though.

79
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,025
He went to Cocoyashi Village to catch him.

80
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,402
Usopp, huh?

81
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:10,238
I guess I'd better go save him...

82
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,035
That Cocoyashi Village, how do I get there?

83
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,162
Get in.

84
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:24,544
Guest, right? I'll take you there, swordsman.

85
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:39,058
What's happened here?

86
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,687
What exactly?

87
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,984
My comrades!

88
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,654
Roronoa...

89
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:55,533
What? What did you just say?

90
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:58,912
Roronoa Zoro.

91
00:07:58,953 --> 00:07:59,746
What?

92
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,539
The Pirate Hunter?

93
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,750
He's come for my head huh?

94
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,880
N-No. He didn't 'come'.

95
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,300
That guy, turned out to be Zoro.

96
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,301
What?

97
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:17,822
The man with the stomach band
that we caught was Roronoa...

98
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:25,355
I caught him Arlong-san.

99
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,399
W-What's... all this..?

100
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,443
Took you long enough Chew.

101
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,863
Don't teII me, Zoro...!

102
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,326
We've arrived.

103
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:43,039
Cocoyashi Village.

104
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,834
Arlong-san should be here, in this village.

105
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,377
Yeah, thanks.

106
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,379
Don't mention it, later.

107
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,969
Oh! I didn't ask you your name!

108
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:59,722
Me? You want to hear my name again?

109
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:02,517
It's Hatchan. Come again!

110
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:05,603
Strange guy...

111
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:16,823
This puny thing won't even fill half of my stomach.

112
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:22,036
You're right! So let me go!

113
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:26,833
That was just a greeting. In my village that's
the common way...to greet people.

114
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,313
But you're one of Zoro's group members right?

115
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:38,470
Well...it's normal to be targeted by a bounty hunter.

116
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,645
Save me! I'm not connected with that Zoro!

117
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,698
Chu! Stop telling such pathetic lies.

118
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:53,117
You attacked Arlong-san didn't you?

119
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,378
Either way there's no saving you.

120
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,351
Oy! What are you insinuating?

121
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:01,451
Me and Zoro are b-buddies!

122
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:05,205
That means, if you lay a finger
on me Zoro won't stand for it.

123
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:09,918
Oh? So you're saying if you are
killed Zoro will come right?

124
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:15,673
No that isn't right! Killing me is definitely bad.

125
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,009
If you keep me alive Zoro will appear.

126
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,095
If you don't keep me alive Zoro won't come.

127
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:23,848
But how did Zoro...

128
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:26,850
get out of the prison?

129
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,228
What are you saying?

130
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,145
I'm saying someone helped him escape.

131
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,772
I'm saying someone helped him escape.

132
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:31,064
I'm saying someone helped him escape.

133
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,335
Arlong-san, isn't it possible to think,

134
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:40,865
In order to get your head, Nami invited Zoro?

135
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,161
Come to think of it lately Nami's
behavior has been strange.

136
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:48,123
Yeah, she jumped in the water and saved Zoro.

137
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:51,292
Could it be that from the start, along with
Zoro, she planned on deceiving us?

138
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,710
Could it be that from the start, along with
Zoro, she planned on deceiving us?

139
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,048
Betrayal is that woman's forte.

140
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:57,090
Betrayal is that woman's forte.

141
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:58,758
That's enough!

142
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,809
Don't end the matter simply
by jumping to conclusions.

143
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:10,228
Nami?

144
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,337
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

145
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,386
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

146
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,626
Watch your mouth.

147
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,838
I'm a traitor?

148
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:41,259
It's been 8 years since I joined the group.

149
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,804
I swore on this tattoo.

150
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:49,851
Sorry. Sorry.

151
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:51,186
Nami, it's only natural that you would be angry.

152
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:51,436
Nami, it's only natural that you would be angry.

153
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:51,770
Nami, it's only natural that you would be angry.

154
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,562
Nami, it's only natural that you would be angry.

155
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,438
Nami, it's only natural that you would be angry.

156
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:53,563
Nami, it's only natural that you would be angry.

157
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:59,068
But don't worry. I never suspected you at all.

158
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,355
You and I have known each other for 8 years.

159
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:07,911
We just got a little worked
up, isn't that right? Nami?

160
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,791
That one that should be killed is
Roronoa Zoro and his partners.

161
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:14,584
Hey Nami...

162
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,546
Say something! Nami!

163
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,468
Damn Zoro. Doing stupid things.

164
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,014
What's wrong Nami?

165
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,644
You don't look well.

166
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:41,319
Long nose here, even you can't save him,

167
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,322
because he attacked Arlong-san.

168
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:45,573
How far?

169
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:48,326
How far do you intend to go on suspecting me?

170
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,162
It's because you're too intelligent.

171
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,041
The amount I promised to Arlong will soon be ready.

172
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,210
Why would I betray you now?

173
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,087
The amount promised?

174
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,588
I know.

175
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,970
The promise from 8 years ago to buy Cocoyashi
village from Arlong for 100 million beli.

176
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,182
But I just don't understand.

177
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,726
Betray the villagers, your family.

178
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,312
You would do anything for money.

179
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,399
Why are you so concerned with Cocoyashi Village?

180
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,193
Why for such a puny village?

181
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:28,241
Actually, I found this in your room.

182
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,831
That's...mine!

183
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,876
What was that?

184
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:39,978
Usopp got caught?

185
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,256
He was just taken to Arlong Park.

186
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:46,426
That man was brave enough to go against Arlong.

187
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:48,069
I'm sure he's been killed already!

188
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:51,806
Shit.

189
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:56,102
So in other words, he was caught
while I was killing time.

190
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,356
Usopp! Stay alive!

191
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,703
Isn't this a treasure map?

192
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,081
Cocoyashi village seems to be marked.

193
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,410
A treasure in Cocoyashi village?

194
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,506
That map is one of my personal belongings.

195
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:27,329
It has nothing to do with you at all!

196
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:30,929
Oh! What's wrong? Getting so excited.

197
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:36,017
W-What is this?

198
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:39,979
What exactly happened here?

199
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,398
It's the work of Pirate Hunter Zoro.

200
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,985
More over, where did you go Hachi?

201
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,114
If you had been here this wouldn't have happened.

202
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:52,909
Of course! If I had been here such
a thing wouldn't have happened.

203
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:55,036
This is beyond forgiveness.

204
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,665
So in other words you don't know
where Zoro disappeared to?

205
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:10,260
Huh? If you mean someone I saw... I did
see a kind of weird swordsman alone.

206
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,473
It was him!?

207
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:19,853
So you did see him you idiot!

208
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,563
So where did Zoro go?

209
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:26,860
Since he said he wanted to see Arlong-san
I took him to Cocoyashi Village.

210
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,532
That means there's nothing to get worked up about.

211
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,577
He is also searching for me.

212
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:40,457
Well... He said he was Arlong-san's guest.

213
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:44,711
I didn't think Arlong-san would
come back so quickly.

214
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:46,120
Zoro is...

215
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,549
That means if I can just buy
myself some more time..!

216
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,223
Why are they interferning?

217
00:15:57,765 --> 00:16:00,143
Everything was going to be resoIved soon.

218
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:04,781
Really soon!

219
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,286
You... want to fight?

220
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:19,579
You're an obstacle.

221
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,081
It's your fault,

222
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:24,751
for having attacked Arlong.

223
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,505
Nami, you really disappoint me.

224
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,678
Luffy didn't doubt you one little bit!
Even after you stole the ship!

225
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:36,846
Even now he trusts you completely!

226
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:37,947
Even now he trusts you completely!

227
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,184
How can you so calmly deceive someone like him!?

228
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:43,812
The only thing I trust is money.

229
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:45,647
He's an idiot for being fooled.

230
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,449
What was that!?

231
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,237
The deal was supposed to have worked out
perfectly without anyone's involvement.

232
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:59,285
I can't let you ruin my 8 years of business.

233
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:04,082
So I wilI at least let you die by my hand.

234
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:10,463
In the little time I haven't seen you,
you've become quite the pirate!

235
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,589
Kill?

236
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,511
You...Me... Don't make me laugh.

237
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:17,846
You'd better not...

238
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,390
underestimate me.

239
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,476
Damn.

240
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,646
There's no 100% way of escaping from here.

241
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:28,189
Killing move!

242
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,270
KEMURIBOSHI!

243
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:39,200
Damn! Its smoke! Don't let him escape!

244
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:42,078
Right now!

245
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,459
This is the kind of thing only you would think up.

246
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:52,464
Stop...

247
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,473
For my business,

248
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,897
this is the only thing I can do.

249
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,274
Nami... you...

250
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,361
Just die.

251
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,746
Great! You avenged us!

252
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,956
Truly a member of the Arlong group!

253
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:35,165
Usopp-aniki has been killed... by Nami-aneki!

254
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:41,471
It was your wish... to die at sea.

255
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:44,224
Nami, sorry for suspecting you.

256
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,768
You truly are our comrade.

257
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,311
Comrades?

258
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:51,523
I don't have any comrades.

259
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,112
The only reason I joined this group,

260
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,989
is to buy Cocoyashi Village.

261
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:02,826
Keep your promise.

262
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,120
The 100 million beli will come soon.

263
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,663
Of course.

264
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,415
I would rather kill myself...

265
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,417
Than break a promise over money.

266
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,920
That's the kind of man I am.

267
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:18,216
Just like Arlong. You understand.

268
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,719
Eerie woman.

269
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:26,432
She's become a really good woman!

270
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,270
Witch...

271
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,231
That woman's a witch!

272
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:38,888
I can see it!

273
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,488
Arlong Park!

274
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,785
Hey! Don't get tired, you bull!

275
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:47,787
It has to be.

276
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:50,165
Sanji-aniki's kick is affecting it.

277
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:52,459
Hey! That's wrong! More to the left!

278
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,169
That's Arlong base over there!

279
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:17,650
Finally... I've come to this point.

280
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:21,446
For 8 years I've endured...

281
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:25,909
Come. From today onwards, this is your room.

282
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:28,887
Your desk. Your pen.

283
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:32,040
Everything you need is here.

284
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,169
I've endured for so long.

285
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,671
There's only one thing left to do...

286
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:03,822
It's just like flying in the sky!

287
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:04,906
It's not 'Iike'!!

288
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:06,649
It's REALLY flying, you...!

289
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:08,576
We're falling!!

290
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:22,882
Landing complete!

291
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:27,387
Yo! Zoro!

292
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:40,692
We've arrived. We've arrived.

293
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:46,698
You bastard... What the heck are you doing???

294
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:48,533
What do you mean?

295
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,535
We've come to take Nami back.

296
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,537
Still haven't found her?

297
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:56,708
Oh yeah. Where are Usopp and Johnny?

298
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,500
Usopp?

299
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:01,004
That's right! This isn't the time to be idling around.

300
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:02,422
What happened?

301
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,467
That guy was caught by Arlong.

302
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,669
If we don't hurry he'll get killed.

303
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,887
He's dead.

304
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:09,812
What?

305
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:16,102
It's too late.

306
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:23,234
Usopp-aniki is dead.

307
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:25,528
He was killed!

308
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:30,366
By Nami-aneki!

309
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,426
Am I...

310
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:52,388
A ghost..?

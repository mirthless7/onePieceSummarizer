1
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:09,925
While delivering itself to the government, Robin received in
exchange the promise which it will not attack us.

2
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:14,925
Then Robin…

3
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,525
we had lied well…

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,525
I will not let Robin die!

5
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,658
Paulee-san!

6
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:03,391
Not yet!

7
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,125
What good is it to reflect?

8
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,991
One takes a boat and one continues them!

9
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:19,725
There are not really the choice.

10
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,550
Allons-y.

11
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:37,458
Oï, the guy with the cords…

12
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,457
Lend to us a boat…

13
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,925
Not, better… there would not be one
another Umi Ressha on the departure?

14
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:49,591
There is one Umi Ressha
in the world, it is Puffing Tom.

15
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,858
It is a legendary work…

16
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:56,725
built by engineers with the danger of their life!

17
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,325
Then to us a boat lends!

18
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,124
Most robust and fastest of this city!

19
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,191
Forget that!

20
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,725
You ace not considering the state of the sea or what?!

21
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,525
You ace failed to make you carry by the waves!

22
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:15,924
It is true! It is impossible
to leave at sea by this time!

23
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:17,057
Be to you idiot or what?

24
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:18,124
Cretin!

25
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:22,258
No boat can cross
Aqua Laguna, even banal.

26
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,725
You ace considering the state of the low city!

27
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:28,591
This city had not moved of an inch
at the time of the preceding ones Aqua Lagunas…

28
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,525
It is deplorable.

29
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:34,591
But this one is out of the commun run.

30
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,791
If you take the sea now,
even the most solid galleon…

31
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,591
would be tiny room in crumbs of only one blow.

32
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:45,725
I will never let to you take a boat
by knowing the risks which you incur!

33
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,925
Wait tomorrow.

34
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,325
It will be lent to you,
but once the storm will have been calmed.

35
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:55,191
Oï, you others, put yourself at the shelter.

36
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,058
Research is finished.

37
00:02:57,258 --> 00:03:00,457
It would be stupid which you are done
to take because you trail.

38
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,458
Well!

39
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,058
If…

40
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,658
If we wait until tomorrow…

41
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:09,991
Will our objectives be filled for as much?

42
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:15,591
I know which kind of place east Enies Lobby.

43
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,991
I remembered some when I heard
that it was an island of the government.

44
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,058
This is not…

45
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:23,591
Isn't this there that the Door of Justice is?

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,400
ANOTHER UMI RESSHA?
THE EXIT OF ROCKET MAN

47
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,791
Isn't this there that the Door of Justice is?

48
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:41,191
It is what that?

49
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:45,658
The island of justice, pertaining
in the Government, Enies Lobby.

50
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,658
It is a so-called Court of justice.

51
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:53,458
The simple fact of being transferred to
Enies Lobby means the judgment.

52
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:57,725
The criminals cross a court of justice empties…

53
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,991
and arrive opposite large and cold door steel.

54
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:07,658
This door is called the Door of Justice.

55
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:13,725
Any criminal passing by this door will re-examine never again light of day, it represents despair.

56
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:18,725
Because, after having left the port, and having crossed this door…

57
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,325
There exist only two places where to join the sea.

58
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,191
The first is the center
decisional of the world military capacity.

59
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:29,191
The General headquarter of the Navy.

60
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:33,725
The second is a place of torture and executions.

61
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:37,925
The most dangerous criminals
in the world prisoners are retained there.

62
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:41,391
It is a vast underwater prison… Impel Down.

63
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:47,525
In short, Enies Lobby does not show
no pity for the criminals.

64
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,125
It has justice only the name, it is not nothing
of other that a court empties that one crosses.

65
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:52,791
Isn't this?

66
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:00,925
For a person sought like Robin,
it will be the hell, where which it goes.

67
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:05,591
In this moment even, in each second Robin
a little more Door of Justice approaches.

68
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,791
One cannot wait tomorrow morning!

69
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:19,058
You seem quite informed,
but lets to me say something to you.

70
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:23,058
Even if the sea were enough calm to leave in boat…

71
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,591
you should not go over there.

72
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:29,591
, You do not forget are pirates!

73
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:36,525
As you said it, Enies Lobby is the entry
towards the center of the World Government.

74
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,458
There is thus a powerful army which defends it.

75
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:45,991
No pirate could hope
there to go to release one of its team-members…

76
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,858
because it knows what would arrive to him then.

77
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:54,525
You intend really to beat you
against the elite of the World Government?!

78
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:01,257
C-C' is true, the guy! Give up!

79
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,524
Because of Aqua Laguna,
you will not be able to embark before the paddle!

80
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,190
You would go towards an unquestionable death!

81
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,991
You would not have any chance of you to leave there!

82
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:09,258
Luffy…

83
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,791
Then, one goes…

84
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:14,658
YOU TO STEAL A BOAT!

85
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:18,525
One leaves at sea NOW!

86
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:24,191
Our friends await us!

87
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,391
DO NOT OBSTRUCT US!!

88
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:33,725
The waves are irritated too!

89
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,724
He wants to fight?

90
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,258
He makes fear…

91
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:44,525
Very well, I will be your adversary.

92
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:54,325
One moment, you others.

93
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:58,325
Kokoro-san.

94
00:08:58,325 --> 00:09:01,391
It is you who you horns, Straw hat.

95
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,057
Paulee rightly, young imbecile.

96
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,390
But keep silent yourself! It is not…

97
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:09,925
Not my business, I know.

98
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,391
Include/understand me well…

99
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:14,791
If one lets to you make, you will die.

100
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:20,658
Listen… if there is a means well for
to pass through this Aqua Laguna…

101
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:24,858
It is without any doubt legendary Umi Ressha.

102
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:30,391
But it is not there, it is for that
that one wants to draw in boat!

103
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:36,458
If you are ready to die, then follow me.

104
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,191
I will lend to you…

105
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:39,925
Umi Ressha!

106
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,390
Who it is?

107
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:08,125
Ch' board not.

108
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,590
Imbeciles! What do you wait?

109
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,591
All the people without uniform are criminals here!

110
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,725
With the attack!

111
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,925
Why is it necessary always that occurs like that?

112
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:36,991
I thought that it was a good plan…

113
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:39,191
To cross without being turned over…

114
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:44,190
Hein?! Sanji!

115
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,391
One moment!

116
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:51,525
One will not let to you make!

117
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,525
Twins?

118
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:16,325
Sanji, what you cards on Umi Ressha?

119
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:19,258
I should turn over you the question.

120
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:29,392
With you euh… of which I do not know the name.

121
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,258
It was not very credible.

122
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,792
Look at that here! Of Den-Den Mushi!

123
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,258
That given pleasure that.

124
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,792
Oh, but thus say y' in has full.

125
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:43,658
It is surely the room of communication.

126
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:50,258
People of the coaches of before had only masks, costumes and full with other tricks which are used for nothing…

127
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,258
I can finally call Nami-san.

128
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:56,858
Thus you, you are in the same pirate crew?

129
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,258
Ex-companions.

130
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,858
And you, be to you who?

131
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:02,858
I am the hidden side of Seven Toilets.

132
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:04,992
Franky, the desossor.

133
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,525
THEN It IS YOU FRANKY! OLD SHIT!

134
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:12,792
You ACE DOES MUCH EVIL
WITH OUR HONEST LONG-PIF!

135
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,458
YOU WANT THAT I CUT YOU IN
HOW MUCH PIECES?!

136
00:12:16,992 --> 00:12:20,258
Have-await, Sanji!
It did without much things since!

137
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:23,524
Dumb! Wait to see that I
remove me from these cords!

138
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,858
It is not the moment to fight.

139
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:30,058
Euh… It saved Merry at one time.

140
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,192
It is true…

141
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,592
Merry is…

142
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,991
Oï oï! It is not the moment to depress!

143
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,257
It does not matter, Nii-chan! Please!

144
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:45,392
Withdraw these cords!

145
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,391
It HAS ME WHICH YOU CAUSE?!

146
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,124
You will remain attached all your life, ducon!

147
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:53,191
Dumb! Go ahead, insults me
whereas I try to be polished!

148
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,791
Stop! Good blood! Oï!

149
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:59,724
If one does not hurry, one will be made locate!

150
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,457
But your mouth you!

151
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,391
What?!

152
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,857
The farm, you two!

153
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,457
Move your bottom and detaches me!

154
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,657
Do not give me orders, you!

155
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:08,658
AAAAH! I CAN about IT MORE!

156
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:15,725
T-Bone captain.

157
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:27,658
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

158
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:34,725
MUGIWARA-TEAM

159
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,458
Franky is also with them…

160
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,725
Yes, but Umi Ressha left.

161
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:53,658
Everyone seeks the crew of
Straw hat, but it is rather difficult…

162
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:01,692
When they know that one can save it,
their force will not know any limit!

163
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:08,725
A cellar!

164
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,925
This warehouse has been with the abandonment for eight years.

165
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:16,325
One has not touched there for twelve years,
and the arrival of Umi Ressha.

166
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:17,858
Allons-y, Chopper!

167
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,458
If that is, it does not function even any more.

168
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,192
Oï! That is likely to pose problem!

169
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,458
Oï oï! Gently…

170
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:35,192
Pas la pains to run. One needs a key to return.

171
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:37,525
What?

172
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:39,392
It is open.

173
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,792
Here it is!

174
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:48,324
They is too cool!

175
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,658
Super!

176
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:55,458
As I said it, it is not perfect.

177
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,258
It was baptized Rocket Man.

178
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,792
It cannot transport passengers.

179
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,324
ROCKET MAN!

180
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:04,991
It with the fast air!

181
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:06,592
Brilliant!

182
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:09,258
It is what this head?

183
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:12,725
The head of shark, it was right to be delirious…

184
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,925
Ice-Ossan…

185
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:21,125
Straw hat, you were quite alive…

186
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,792
The girl pirates had thus seen just.

187
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,725
Kokoro-san brought you here then.

188
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,725
It would be said that are to you always in life, Iceberg.

189
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,058
What do you make there?

190
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:35,192
I came here for the same reason as you.

191
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,592
I was not going to drop these morons!

192
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:46,892
Take it.

193
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,925
I prepared it.

194
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:52,225
Water and coal are charged,
the vapor is pressurizing itself.

195
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:55,658
Ossan, you prepared it for us?!

196
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,258
You will celebrate that only on your return.

197
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:05,592
This Rocket Man, it does not matter how one regulates it,
its speed remains unverifiable.

198
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:08,392
It is a missed prototype going back to before Puffing Tom.

199
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,458
I cannot guarantee your safety.

200
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:15,592
Ah! Thank you, Ice-Ossan!

201
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:20,258
Yosh, it left!

202
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:22,258
The guy, one goes up!

203
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:25,725
Granny! Make signs to us as soon as Nami arrives!

204
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:31,125
Does Luffy, that go?

205
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,992
You do not stop losing
balance since presently.

206
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:36,058
You ace due to lose too much blood.

207
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:39,525
I have much of forces…

208
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:41,258
So only I had meat.

209
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,125
Quickly! By here!

210
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:46,858
Wait!

211
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:50,124
Not need to make all this way,
you do not want to eat here rather?!

212
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,324
Yes! You have a small hollow, it is that?

213
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,958
YOU THINK THAT I CAN PUFF OUT ALL THAT?!

214
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,125
Hein?!

215
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,857
Afflicted, I am late!

216
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:57,657
Nami.

217
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,925
Oï! But what did you foutais?

218
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,925
Hurry to go up, idiot!

219
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,792
Wow, brilliant…

220
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,658
It is also Umi Ressha?

221
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,457
I would ever have thought that there was another here.

222
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,792
Impressing.

223
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:12,591
Where you stays passed, Nami?

224
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,725
It is you which said that one did not have time!

225
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,592
And it is what this bag?!

226
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:17,791
Meat and beer.

227
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,792
Dé' cholé to be to me irritated!

228
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:28,725
If you are able to make it jump of the sewers and to
to hang to the railway, it will already not be badly.

229
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,257
That will go.

230
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,192
I can better control these machines that whoever.

231
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:36,458
Te do not make a concern and rests a little.

232
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,524
I thank you.

233
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:42,525
Chimney must be playing some
leaves by there, take care of it well.

234
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:43,858
Well.

235
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,725
Worry you, I am sure that it is well.

236
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,525
Even when it was made press by Umi Ressha…

237
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:55,392
it knew to be raised.

238
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:59,325
Moreover, there will be the Lord of the Pirates with us.

239
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:05,058
STRAW HAT!

240
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,792
Them…?

241
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,192
Franky Family!

242
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:17,192
It is really not the moment…

243
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:19,258
Please…

244
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:21,525
TAKE US ALONG WITH YOU!

245
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:26,058
Of the guy of Galley said it to us
that you leave for Enies Lobby!

246
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:31,592
Franky-Aniki is taken along over there by
the government, one wants to continue them…

247
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:35,792
But one cannot pass Aqua Laguna all alone!

248
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,457
It is World Government in question…

249
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,657
One of fout of which it is!

250
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:42,457
One wants to bring back Aniki!

251
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,992
We are ready to risk
our lives for the good of Aniki!

252
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,592
Please!

253
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:49,392
Lend to us your force…

254
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:50,992
Straw hat!

255
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,925
Pity… it is somebody of important for us!

256
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,058
You joke I hope!

257
00:18:57,192 --> 00:19:00,392
Must I point out to you what you did to us?!

258
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,392
I include/understand…

259
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,592
There is shame, but it nevertheless is asked to you!

260
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,725
One wants to save Aniki!

261
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,058
Go up.

262
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:32,825
In speed!

263
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:38,525
Straw hat…

264
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,325
But finally, Luffy!

265
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:44,258
That goes, they are cool…

266
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,525
AFFLICTED!!

267
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,792
You will be revaudra that!

268
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,658
You dispatch.

269
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,392
But one will not travel by this train!

270
00:19:55,592 --> 00:20:00,058
One will join you by taking the sea with our King bulldozers!

271
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,258
One will have just to attach them to the back of the train!

272
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:04,858
King Bull?

273
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:06,325
Well, one counts on you!

274
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:07,792
Go, with immediately!

275
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,725
It left!

276
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:23,325
Brilliant! One will be able to help Aniki!

277
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,258
Quickly!

278
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,550
Will that go?

279
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:39,525
Well, one will go there!

280
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,858
Now, dear pirates…

281
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,458
Take care not to fall from the train!

282
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:39,592
We leave Water Seven,
in direction of Enies Lobby, on board Umi Ressha…

283
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,658
Rocket Man!

284
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:48,992
Yosh! It is a Departure!

285
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,525
It left! Everyone is brought back!

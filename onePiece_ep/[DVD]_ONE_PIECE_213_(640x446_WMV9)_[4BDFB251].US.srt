1
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:02,716
GO!!

2
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:13,650
GOAL! GOOAL! GOOOAL!

3
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:17,550
Which bright victory for
the team of the straw hat!

4
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,916
SHELLY!!

5
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,715
Pa-not-believable…

6
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:35,115
That which the captain Monkey D. Luffy wants…

7
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,649
is the adored horse of Tonjit, Shelly!

8
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,316
What is this that it has at the head?

9
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,783
I recovered Shelly for you, Ossan.

10
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:49,915
Friends…

11
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,050
You will be together from now on.

12
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:54,916
Afflicted… and thank you.

13
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,649
Then it was for that.

14
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,450
I imagine that one could not make differently.

15
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:08,316
Chopper!

16
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:10,850
Does my decision pose a problem to you?

17
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:14,050
Absolutely none!

18
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:16,582
Chopper.

19
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,382
Do not worry you one controls the situation!

20
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,650
Serious, is necessary for you that stop you playing it to you…

21
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,450
I wonder what will resemble the next play.

22
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,983
Is necessary to hurry, one must go there.

23
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,599
One must bring back Chopper as fast as possible!

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,600
THIRD ROUND!
THE INSANE RACE TO ROLL!

25
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:48,116
Shelly do not make any you, all well will happen.

26
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:50,716
I rely on them.

27
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,849
Radishes and mochikinchaku, two of each.

28
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,983
That comes.

29
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,982
Bring back to me the pillar No 65!

30
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:00,182
Accelerate the rate/rhythm!

31
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,716
Where is the planer?!

32
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,850
The next test seems interesting.

33
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,449
Interesting?

34
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,315
And poor Chopper in all that, you think of him Robin?

35
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:17,983
It is true, I am sorry.

36
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,116
Ouais me, they are good…

37
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,583
Finally it anything is compared with these
who foutent themselves some royally.

38
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,182
Oh! You too nice are equipped like that!

39
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:32,583
Is that there, you are ready?

40
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,049
What do you eat, Luffy?

41
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,449
An extra-long kiwi.

42
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,916
It is Ossan which gave it to us, they are delicious.

43
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,249
In will not have you.

44
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,849
I do not want any!

45
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,850
Mellorine!

46
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:50,182
The third test is the race in rollers,

47
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,049
“Roller Around”.

48
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,782
This test will proceed in 5 handles.

49
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:57,116
The rules are simple,

50
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:02,449
With the first whistle, a Point-Getter
from each team the race will begin.

51
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,883
After 20 seconds, the whistle will resound again
to allow Defenders to spring.

52
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:12,250
Defenders will be able is to attack,
either to defend, all is allowed.

53
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:19,183
To gain a sleeve, it is necessary that the Point-Getter
that is to say at the head of the race at the end of 5 minutes.

54
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,850
Even the smallest variation will be
accepted to gain the victory.

55
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:30,916
With the fact, me it is Itomi Mizu and I will be on the starting line to comment on you this test!

56
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:35,983
Well! The two teams are about to arrive!

57
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,915
Ok, one gains and one recovers Chopper.

58
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,516
I count on you!

59
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:51,383
Oh, here members of Mugiwara Dangers!

60
00:05:56,716 --> 00:06:01,383
And opposite, here the ultimate team, Foxy Devils!

61
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,650
First of all, their foreman Porch-chan,

62
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,116
follow-up of the Chiqicheetah skater,

63
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,449
behind them the imposing Public garden,

64
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,715
then the man-fish Juuren and Girarring come.

65
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:19,315
Let us not forget our dear Foxy which
will be coach and Hamburger the manager.

66
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:22,250
This formation really deserves
its title “of ultimate team”!

67
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,250
Do Hein… you want me what?

68
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:39,383
Ho… Chiqicheetah it decided to pass
with the attack before the beginning of the test?!

69
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,516
What does it have this type with renifler?

70
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:50,250
This type is not only fast, it
has also a hyper-developed sense of smell.

71
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:52,983
Would not have eaten you something which been able?

72
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:58,582
He, you ace not eaten cheese rotted from Ossan?

73
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,182
Ah it is for that it me renifle.

74
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:02,050
Thus you of puffed out ace!!

75
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,249
What a badly high!

76
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,583
Oust, oust!

77
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:14,050
It would seem well that it found the reason.

78
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:17,516
I will continue to state the rules.

79
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:21,716
The coach and the manager of each team…

80
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:25,183
will not have the right to intervene
directly in the play, moreover,

81
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,450
each member cannot be Point-Getter
that only once during the 5 handles!

82
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,382
Ah, it would seem that Mugiwara Dangers
have only 4 players.

83
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:37,783
What will one make?

84
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,715
I do not have the choice…

85
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:45,516
That does not disturb me only one of
you is Point-Getter twice.

86
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,250
On the other hand, your pride could take a blow of it…

87
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,450
I do not like the way in which he says that.

88
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,249
Oyabin, you are too generous!

89
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,315
I am moved per such an amount of kindness!

90
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:58,115
You are a true gentleman!

91
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:01,982
Eh well, if you it known as…

92
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:05,050
He really believes in these compliments cans.

93
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,049
Head of puzzle is too naive.

94
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,983
One would believe an actor of série B in the retirement.

95
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,983
Iyan Oyabin, remain with us.

96
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:18,583
Good, as your offer is with
our advantage, one accepts it.

97
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,049
I would have preferred to refuse, but there are not the choice.

98
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,250
To save Chopper, one must know
to put side our pride.

99
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,650
Thank you well.

100
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,583
But knows that a combat remains
a combat, one will not lose!

101
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,115
You underestimate me.

102
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,849
I will explain you why I am lenient with you…

103
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,250
It is because…

104
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,316
the Ultimate one…

105
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,715
One will recover Chopper!

106
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:47,982
Ouais!!

107
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,650
Oyabin!

108
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,982
By a mutual assent, the rules were modified.

109
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:58,316
Mugiwara Dangers, please choose quickly
the Point-Getter of each handle.

110
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:05,050
Since it is a test in 5 handles,
the odd sleeves are most important,

111
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,116
especially the first.

112
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,715
I want to make two handles.

113
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,715
Of agreement? Of agreement?

114
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,716
I included/understood, calm myself and let reflect to me!

115
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,916
If one leaves in Luffy the first and
last sleeve like agreed…

116
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,450
Ouais!!

117
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:24,850
Nami-san and Ussop do not support
not a too strong pressure…

118
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,583
Robin-chan,

119
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,515
I, could you are afflicted deal with the 3rd handle?

120
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,182
Of course, it does not matter the sleeve which I will carry out.

121
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,049
Thank you… wait…

122
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,783
they also must surely think
the same thing as us…

123
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,315
what wants to say…

124
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:39,582
Coach.

125
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,715
Hurry!

126
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:42,183
They is good! I finished!

127
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,315
Luffy will be 1st and 5th, Nami-san 2nd,

128
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:47,983
Ussop 3rd and Robin-chan 4th.

129
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:51,982
Wait one second, why it is you who selected?

130
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:52,915
Hein?

131
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,582
It is obvious, it is because I
am the coach and to manage it to you.

132
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,849
You insane of my mouth?!

133
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,515
Why I should follow your instructions to nut?!

134
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,049
It is obvious,

135
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,316
a marimo as cannot be to you coach!

136
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:09,116
Keep your valves for your eyebrows,
anti-mosquito incense species feeling reluctant!

137
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:13,982
A last very important rule…

138
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:16,650
You calm, one does not understand anything!

139
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:23,650
So by chance you leave the perimeter of race or
you are mistaken in direction, you will be disqualified.

140
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,450
It is also interdict to fly or plane.

141
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,716
I received the list, for the first sleeve,

142
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,115
Oh, Luffy with the straw hat against Porch-chan.

143
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,915
It is a duel between the foremen.

144
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,315
The hostilities will be launched as of the first round.

145
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:44,316
The match will begin!

146
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,515
I am very excited, I adore these plays!

147
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:49,582
Me too!

148
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,115
Porch-chan, mets a rouste with this type!

149
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:54,183
Hein?

150
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,850
Look at to me that!

151
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,615
It is what that?

152
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:01,850
Not possible…

153
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,117
It is complicated.

154
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:15,250
What do I see?

155
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:19,250
Me I saw anything of the whole!

156
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,682
What does it occur?

157
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:28,983
It doesnot can make some?

158
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,116
According to information which I have in hand,
Luffy must take part in 2 handles.

159
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:35,717
Ca will be one crowned spectacle.

160
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:39,650
I bet that they will give up!

161
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,183
It will be an easy victory.

162
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,382
What does it still hold for us?

163
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:53,850
Perhaps that it will be the third
the most crucial sleeve after all…

164
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,517
Lu-Luffy…

165
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:09,550
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

166
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:16,717
MUGIWARA-TEAM

167
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,649
The two participants are on the starting line,

168
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,916
but it would seem that a team is largely favoured.

169
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,517
It is the moment to begin!

170
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,382
Be to you really a case! To want to play two
handles without same knowledge to patinate…

171
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,916
It is not my fault.

172
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,250
I did not think that it would be so hard!

173
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:39,516
One is foutus, it is in ON position is damned.

174
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:42,450
There are not the choice, it should be helped.

175
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:44,516
They is good, the race will begin,

176
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:46,049
please take seat, please.

177
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,782
He, it is still you!

178
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:51,250
If you want to still cheat, will see
elsewhere, it is better for you!

179
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,850
Since our victory is ensured,
one will not need to cheat.

180
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:02,449
Third test:“Around Round”!

181
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,849
Who will gain the first sleeve?

182
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,317
Luffy with the straw hat or Porch-chan?!

183
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:12,717
With your marks!

184
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:20,783
Porch-chan started in waterspout!

185
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,450
On the other hand, Luffy with the straw hat…

186
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,182
fact of balance!

187
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:28,317
It was knocked and did not pass the starting line yet.

188
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,917
Impressing the way in which it was knocked.

189
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,116
These foutus machines!

190
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:36,917
You will be disqualified if you withdraw your roller skates!

191
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,183
Shit!

192
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:44,583
, I wait have right need for me agripp…

193
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,117
Iyan, my victory is assured.

194
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:51,916
20 seconds were passed,

195
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,183
Defenders enter in race!

196
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,717
He! It is dropped! Leaves from there!

197
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,650
It is a joke?!

198
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,183
It is what?

199
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,382
Gomu Gomu No Fuzen!

200
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,450
I have an idea, come with me Ussop!

201
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:22,317
One has just to make it roll.

202
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,450
Luffy blocks your breathing!

203
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,983
It is damaged.

204
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,382
Robin!

205
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:40,916
Still a blow of this woman!

206
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:41,917
Incredible.

207
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,317
What a speed!

208
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,050
To this pace it soon will catch up with Porch-chan!

209
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,982
Incredible! It is the first time
that I see a similar race!

210
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:05,583
But opposite, it there with the surpuissante
defense of Foxy Devils!

211
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,183
The wall.

212
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,382
It of it is magnificiently drawn!

213
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,116
It is nothing any more but one question of seconds
before it catches up with Porch-chan!

214
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,082
Played well, Robin-chwan!

215
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,517
Not so quickly…

216
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:41,383
What a damage!

217
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,250
Luffy with the straw hat left the race!

218
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,116
Not that!

219
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,717
They sliced it!

220
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,650
You are well, Luffy?!

221
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,849
You do not worry, my blade does not slice,

222
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,650
it is right for the spectacle.

223
00:15:57,117 --> 00:15:58,717
I feel badly.

224
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,550
The mouth opens to see…?

225
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,049
That is badly…

226
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,249
if Robin, Usopp or me lose,

227
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,482
our destiny would rest on Luffy.

228
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:11,483
This rate/rhythm, one is likely to leave there
someone else with Chopper.

229
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:16,782
The winner of the first sleeve is Porch-chan.

230
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,917
Foxy Devils gain a point.

231
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,982
SHIT!!

232
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,650
THAT IS ENOUGH! GO DOWN FROM!

233
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,583
Eh well, let us continue!

234
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:29,049
The Point-Getters of the next sleeve are,

235
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,649
Nami the navigatrice…

236
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,850
against the man-wall the defender Public garden.

237
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,917
I do not have the choice I must absolutely gain.

238
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,116
For the second handle, please take seat!

239
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,183
With your marks…

240
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,517
That is there, they launched out! Let us see what it occurs.

241
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:57,916
Public garden is too much slow!

242
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:01,917
Sublime Nami does not cease a accraître its advance!

243
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:04,717
What it fout this type? It is serious?

244
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,382
But how is what it manufactures?!

245
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:12,182
It has a plan?

246
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:15,050
Do not be concerned with him, accelerates Nami!

247
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,383
The second whistle is given!

248
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:19,983
Robin, allons-y!

249
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,517
What do they want us?

250
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,249
Try to pass, if you can it of course.

251
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,517
Our defense is insuperable.

252
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,382
Why do they put places this defensive line from there?

253
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:36,249
Since it is we who are at the head.

254
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,783
It is what your problem, let pass to us!

255
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,917
Pay to, does not overwork Luffy.

256
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,050
If that continues like that, one will gain in any event.

257
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,250
Perhaps well.

258
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,183
What…?

259
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,916
Say to me not that one fell asleep?

260
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:24,183
I have the impression of it.

261
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:33,983
But did nothing change, one is in the same place, not?

262
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:34,917
Yes.

263
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:38,117
Nami! Hurry!

264
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,250
Hurry to set out again!

265
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,582
You must take again the race!

266
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,882
5…
You must take again the race!

267
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:43,982
4…

268
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:44,449
Why?

269
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,399
3…
Why?

270
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,650
2…

271
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,150
1!

272
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:54,649
The team of Foxy gains the second sleeve!

273
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,317
They are largely in advance!

274
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,517
It is not possible…

275
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:01,517
They doubled us while one slept.

276
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,717
Exactly, our team work is perfect.

277
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,817
I really did not think only one
could gain with Square.

278
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,817
You are serious?

279
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,650
If the team of Foxy gains again,
the team of Luffy would lose this test!

280
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,983
Their destiny will be played in the third handle…

281
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:25,517
Ussop Length-nose against Speedstar Chiqicheetah!

282
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,649
Oh not…

283
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,717
Stop making pretense be sick!

284
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,783
Chiqicheetah…

285
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:44,317
it is a kind of cheetah.
I am not likely any to gain!

286
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,383
Not like that. Use your hips to balance you.

287
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,517
You of ace already made front?

288
00:19:51,783 --> 00:19:52,449
Not tries to take my advice, rises to see.

289
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,249
- I cannot count on him, I must find a plan.
Not tries to take my advice, rises to see.

290
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,983
Not tries to take my advice, rises to see.

291
00:19:58,383 --> 00:19:59,450
Like that?

292
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,249
Not!

293
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,383
Like that?

294
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:03,849
Not!

295
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,117
Like that?

296
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,383
I already said you NOT!

297
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,383
Please take seat!

298
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:11,782
Loans!
I must remain concentrated.

299
00:20:11,783 --> 00:20:13,049
I must remain concentrated.

300
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,383
I do not have the right to ravel me,
I will patinate like a patient.

301
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,383
He! I am at the head of the race!

302
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,650
It is fast!

303
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,182
Nobody can compete with
Chiqicheetah of pure speed.

304
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,649
It does not even need our assistance.

305
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,717
Shit, I am with flock!

306
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,250
It is not possible, it already finished a turn?

307
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,782
Why don't you take a little rest?

308
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,849
You did not gain yet!

309
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,582
The 20 seconds were passed.

310
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,650
Defenders Go!

311
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,583
Allons-y Robin!

312
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,383
Iyan, which tenacity.

313
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:56,183
He is already there.

314
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:57,983
Take that!

315
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,850
Here, am my councils and that will go.

316
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:22,982
You are there almost!

317
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,783
Still an effort!

318
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:28,449
They is good!

319
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,383
Remain Luffy upright!

320
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:41,183
I feel a little moved…

321
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:44,117
Luffy!

322
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,049
Yosh! I succeeded!

323
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,717
Hold good, Ussop!

324
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:52,850
Hold good, Chopper!

1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,250
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,150
The man who had acquired everything in this 
world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,890
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,570
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,500
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,220
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,010
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,330
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,070
The bridge is being lowered!

10
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,120
Looks like those guys did it.

11
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,240
What great timing.

12
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,360
T-Trembles from excitement....

13
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,790
Robin!

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,960
We'll save you no matter what!

15
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,770
Hurry up and lower it.

16
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,790
What an evil looking face...

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,060
I heard you're a bad guy.

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,890
You're still here?

19
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,190
Being publicly humiliated in a place like this...

20
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,120
Are you really strong?

21
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,340
That's none of your business!

22
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,660
Geez, I ended up in quite a place just for partnering up with Luffy.

23
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,450
The Ways of a Man's Life! Zoro's Technique and Usopp's Dreams

24
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,420
You're weak as usual, huh, Zoro?

25
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,600
I made a promise.

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,200
There's no way I can die in a place like this.

27
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,530
You again? You must have nothing better to do.

28
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,640
I'll untie your ropes, so become my nakama.

29
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,530
What was that?

30
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm looking for nakama to become pirates with.

31
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,990
No thanks!

32
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,750
Willingly become a criminal?

33
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,400
How dense can you be?

34
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,060
What's wrong with being a pirate?

35
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,110
Pirates are scum, why would I become one?

36
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,250
Who cares?

37
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,970
You're already known as a bad pirate hunter.

38
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,610
I don't care what society says about me...

39
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,500
But I've never done anything I regret.

40
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,290
I will survive no matter what,

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,380
and I'm going to do what I want to do!

42
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,680
Okay...

43
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,790
But I've already decided that I'm gonna make you my nakama.

44
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't decide that by yourself!

45
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,070
You use a sword right?

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah, but that stupid son took them away.

47
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,840
I'll get it back for you.

48
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,240
What?

49
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,670
So if you want your sword back, you have to become my nakama!

50
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,380
THAT'S BLACKMAIL!!

51
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,880
Does he intend to take on the base by himself?

52
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,240
After him! Don't let him escape!

53
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,830
Major! There's someone in the execution field!

54
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,040
What?

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,550
Rebels coming one after another, huh?

56
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,940
Please escape, Zoro-san.

57
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,960
They'll kill you if I did that!

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,390
I can't watch these Marines any longer.

59
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,460
I want to be a good Marine.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,870
Stop it! I can't escape now!

61
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,860
I have ten more days to...

62
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,110
You're being executed tomorrow.

63
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,760
What?

64
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,600
 Helmeppo had no intention of keeping his word with you from the beginning.

65
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,590
That's why Luffy-san got angry and punched him.

66
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,460
He did?

67
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,910
Luffy-san is currently being chased by the Marines.

68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm not telling you to become a pirate.

69
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,090
But please...

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,600
Please help Luffy-san.

71
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,100
The only one that can save Zoro-san is Luffy-san.

72
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,930
And now, I think the only person that can help Luffy-san is you.

73
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,540
Hold it right there!

74
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,540
You guys have done some interesting things.

75
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,640
Are the two of you...

76
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,410
...trying to start a Coup d'Etat along with the Straw Hat?

77
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,410
-

78
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,620
I have always fought alone.

79
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,200
Unlike you, hiding arrogantly behind your henchmen!!

80
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,210
Roronoa Zoro.

81
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,450
Don't underestimate me.

82
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,190
Your strength is nothing compared to my authority!

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,520
Take aim!

84
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,690
I cannot...

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,930
...die in a place like this!

86
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,410
You're weak as usual, huh, Zoro?

87
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,230
Gomu Gomu no Rocket!!

88
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,240
Fire!

89
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,140
You!

90
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,180
Luffy-san!

91
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:03,990
Straw Hat!

92
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,200
That's not gonna work!

93
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,640
See, I told you. I'm strong!

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,640
What the hell are  you?

95
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,350
I'm Monkey D. Luffy.

96
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm the man who's going to become the Pirate King!

97
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,410
Become the Pirate King?

98
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,280
Do you even understand what you're saying?

99
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,260
A Pirate King is a Pirate King.

100
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,250
Does it mean anything else?

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,530
I was surprised too!

102
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,220
But Luffy-san is serious. That's the kind of person he is!

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,860
He's going to become the pirate king and intends to obtain

104
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,780
the world's ultimate treasure, One Piece!

105
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,920
Here you go, your treasure.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,750
Which one is it?

107
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,260
I didn't know, so I brought all three of them.

108
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,590
Santoryu = Three Sword

109
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,590
All three are mine, I use the santoryu style.

110
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,240
You'll take them, right?

111
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,520
If you fight with me now, you'll become a criminal for going up against the government.

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280
Or you can be killed by the Marines now, which would you prefer?

113
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,730
Are you the son of the devil?

114
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,510
It doesn't matter.

115
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,130
If I'm gonna die here, then I'd rather become one.

116
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,510
A pirate!

117
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,290
Yeah! You're going to be my nakama!

118
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,820
Great! That's fantastic!

119
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,970
Alright, alright! Hurry up and untie me!

120
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,780
What is that guy?

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,590
He deflected the bullets!

122
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,800
That Straw Hat is no ordinary human.

123
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,600
He must have eaten one of the rumored Devil Fruits.

124
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,580
The Devil Fruits?

125
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,270
Damn, this knot is hard...

126
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,210
Oi, hurry up!

127
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,640
No matter what the person is, anyone who opposes me will be executed!

128
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,300
If guns don't work, then slice him up!

129
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,110
Uh oh, that's weird. The knot's getting tighter.

130
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,870
Hurry up and give me my swords!

131
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,260
Luffy-san!

132
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,630
Roronoa Zoro.

133
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,490
He's so cool!

134
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,880
If any of you move, I'll cut you.

135
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
He's too scary!

136
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,120
I'll become a pirate, that's a promise.

137
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,100
And now that I'm opposing the Marines, I guess that makes me a criminal.

138
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,620
But let me just say one thing.

139
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,570
I will achieve my ambition.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,510
Ambition?

141
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,280
To become the world's greatest swordsman.

142
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,340
But if you ever do anything to jeopardize my ambition...

143
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,280
Then you'd better make it up to me with your life!

144
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,440
The world's number one swordsman...

145
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,010
That's good.

146
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,970
I expect nothing less if you're gonna be a nakama of a Pirate King.

147
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,970
Big talker, eh?

148
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,590
Then I guess I have no choice but to let the world know of my name, even as a criminal.

149
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,070
What are you just standing there for?

150
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,590
Hurry up and finish them off!

151
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,840
Get down, Zoro!

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,420
Gomu Gomu no Muchi! (Whip)

153
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,340
H-He did it! So amazing!

154
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,980
What in the world are you?

155
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,930
I ate the rubber fruit.

156
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,840
The rubber fruit?

157
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,200
He's a rubber man!

158
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,160
Just as I suspected, he did eat one of the Devil Fruits.

159
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,420
Major! There's no way we can match him!

160
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,190
These guys are crazy!

161
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,470
We can't even match up with Roronoa Zoro!

162
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,700
This is a Major's order.

163
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,410
All those that just complained, shoot yourselves in the head!

164
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,660
I don't need any weak subordinates!

165
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,050
There is definitely something wrong with these Marines.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,960
Luffy-san!

167
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,930
Demolish these damn Marines!

168
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,120
There's no one who can overpower my authority!

169
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,810
I'm the Marine Major, Axe-Hand Morgan!

170
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm Luffy.

171
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:32,740
Pleased to meet ya.

172
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,740
M... Major!

173
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,480
You little brat!

174
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,010
DIE!!

175
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,070
I don't wanna!

176
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,380
Major Morgan is...

177
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,390
Completely losing...

178
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,160
What kind of a Marine are you? Destroying Coby's dream like that!

179
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,680
Wait! Straw Hat!

180
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,880
Look at this!

181
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,390
I said wait, didn't I!? Are you an idiot!?

182
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,490
I went out of the way to take a hostage and you don't even notice!

183
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,930
Helmeppo-sama...

184
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,850
Oi.

185
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,000
If you want this kid to live, then don't move!

186
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,900
Make even the slightest move and I'll shoot him!

187
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,900
Luffy-san!

188
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,800
I don't ever want to get in your way!

189
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,240
Even if I die!

190
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
Yeah, I know.

191
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,180
Give it up, stupid son.

192
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,370
Coby's determination is the real thing.

193
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,910
Don't move!

194
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,580
I said not to move, didn't I!?

195
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,460
I-I'll shoot him!

196
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,170
Behind you!

197
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,220
I am the Marine Major, Axe-Hand Morgan!!

198
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
Dad! Hurry up and get him!

199
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,010
Nice!

200
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,540
Zoro.

201
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,320
Not a problem... Captain.

202
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,490
The bridge stopped!

203
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,290
Don't interfere!

204
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,660
What the hell! Damn it!

205
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,550
Who is it!?

206
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,940
Don't worry, Robin...

207
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,990
These tremors are... just tremors of excitement.

208
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,920
We will save you, no matter what.

209
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,130
But, there are a lot of enemies, right?

210
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,810
You've got fear written all over your face.

211
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,990
M-M-Me? Scared!? I'll be fine even if there's many of them!

212
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,700
Because I am the courageous warrior of the sea, Captain Usopp!

213
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,300
Because I am the courageous warrior of the sea, Captain Usopp!

214
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,110
Damn it! Damn it!

215
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,050
Don't judge me!

216
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,290
These guys are Klahadore's pirates!

217
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,770
Scary is scary!

218
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,010
So what!?

219
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,400
I don't want any sympathy from you!

220
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,150
You guys get out of here! Get lost!

221
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,650
We're not laughing...

222
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,980
We're going to help you because we think you're noble.

223
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,870
I'd never bet my life out of sympathy.

224
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,350
You guys!

225
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,830
Usopp!

226
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,380
D-Damn it...

227
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,160
My body won't move.

228
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,680
Even if you catch up with Jango, you don't stand a chance against him.

229
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,650
That's probably safer for you.

230
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,380
Even if...

231
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,130
Even if I don't stand a chance, I'm gonna protect them.

232
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,900
I'm gonna protect those guys.

233
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:52,250
I'm the captain of the Usopp Pirate crew, and a courageous warrior of the sea!

234
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,110
I won't let you lay a finger on anyone from this village!!

235
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,450
He's screaming something.

236
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,300
Hey! Look at him, he's crying!

237
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,980
What's so damn funny!?

238
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:23,800
Luffy!

239
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,190
I'm going after the hypnotist with Usopp.

240
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,170
Any problems with that?

241
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,560
Nope! Hurry!

242
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,510
You were a bit too late, haramaki!

243
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,510
Haramaki = The cloth band that wraps around Zoro's midsection.

244
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,700
Not really.

245
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,370
Yes! That branch was in the way!

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,650
What?

247
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,000
Usopp-san...

248
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,360
Hissatsu Kayaku Boshi

249
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,360
Killing Weapon Gunpowder Star!

250
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,310
So you're setting out to sea like I thought, Usopp-san?

251
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,880
Yeah, I'm gonna get outta here before my determination wavers.

252
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,130
Don't try to stop me.

253
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,250
I won't stop you, I had a feeling this would happen.

254
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,340
That's a bit lonely too though.

255
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,450
The next time I come back to this village,

256
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,310
I'll tell you even more outrageous adventure stories more unbelievable than the lies I used to tell you.

257
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,600
I'll be looking forward to it.

258
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,930
You guys take care too.

259
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,140
Maybe we can run into each other again somewhere.

260
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,370
Why?

261
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,730
"Why?"

262
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,880
Man, you're a cold guy.

263
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,080
We're gonna be pirates from now, so we'll eventually meet at sea...

264
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,890
What are you talking about?

265
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,300
Hurry up and get on.

266
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,500
We're already nakama, aren't we?

267
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,720
The captain...

268
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,100
The captain better be me!

269
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,640
Don't be stupid! I'm the captain!

270
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,720
Oi, you pirates! What are you lingering around for?

271
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,400
Lingering? But the bridge is only halfway...

272
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,860
Halfway is more than enough.

273
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,380
I'll be there in four more seconds.

274
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,610
So jump into the waterfall with all you've got!

275
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,800
Was it the baasan? What did she mean?

276
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,830
I don't know, but she said to jump into the waterfall.

277
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,720
The sea train?

278
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,230
What's the meaning of that smile...

279
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,140
HERE WE GO!!

280
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,280
Robin, it must have been hard.

281
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,850
But you're not alone anymore.

282
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,580
Wait for us Robin, we're all on your side.

283
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,670
So believe in your nakama, believe in Luffy!

284
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,970
Luffy will definitely answer you.

285
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,400
Next time, One Piece: Tears Which Weaved the Bond of Nakama!
 Nami's Map of the World.

286
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,550
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

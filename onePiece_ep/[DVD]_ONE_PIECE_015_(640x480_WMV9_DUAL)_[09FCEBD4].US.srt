00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:56,690
The Kuroneko Pirate crew isn't what it used to be...

2
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:02,446
We are useless?

How did he do that?

47
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,027
His arms simply extended!

48
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:25,028
But how could he do that?!

49
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:25,529

You guys, cut it out!!

81
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:29,134
Yosh! I think he's suffered enough.

82
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:36,683
They've totally pissed Captain Kuro off now.

83
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:39,728
Those stupid brats!

00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:41,855
Captain!

85
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,608
Just as we thought, Captain's fighting them!

86
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,985
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

87
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,278
Are we insiders?

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,489
No, outsiders?!

89
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:52,491
Whatever!

90
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,660
Anyways, you guys gotta get out of here now!

91
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:55,953
Run!

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,829
No!

93
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,915
We'll fight with you!

94
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,793
If we ran, it'd bring dishonor
to the Usopp Pirate crew!

95
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:17,057
You morons, hurry up and get outta here!

96
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:17,224
You morons, hurry up and get outta here!

97
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:17,391

You morons, hurry up and get outta here!

106
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,158
Captain!!!

107
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,877
Not bad...

108
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:48,422
That was a pretty good punch
you threw at me there.

109
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:50,257
You!

110
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,844
You possess the power of the
Devil's Fruit, don't you?!

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,889
Yeah, the rubber fruit.

112
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,309
I'm a rubber man!

113
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:03,270
What?! That's bad news!

114
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,771
Those things do exist!

115
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:05,230
No wonder he's so weird!

116
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,189
No wonder he's so weird!

117
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,816
So, he's a rubber man.

118
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,361
His arms stretching out so long wasn't
just me seeing things then.

119
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:14,823
Jango!

120
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,117
I will take care of this kid.

121
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,621
Please take care of Kaya-ojousama.

122
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,082
She will write the will as planned...

123
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:24,124
She will write the will as planned...

124
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,084
Then kill her!

125
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,670
And the three ants over there...

126
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,963
And the three ants over there...

127
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:31,715
are an eyesore!

128
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,761
Understood.

129
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:41,391
Stop.

130
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:42,726
I won't let you pass me.

131
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:45,354
I won't let you pass me.

132
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:47,356
Buchi!!

133
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,609
Cat Kill, STUMP!

134
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:54,279
Cat Kill, STUMP!

135
00:06:54,363 --> 00:06:54,947
That again?!

136
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:55,447
That again?!

137
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,900
His power's completely different from before.

138
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,319
Damn.

139
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:35,696
Kaya!!

140
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:35,779

141
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:35,821

I have no strength left...

147
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:50,586
I have no strength left...

148
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:50,669
I have no strength left...

149
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:50,711
I have no strength left...

150
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:50,836
I have no strength left...

151
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:51,295
I have no strength left...

152
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,837
I have no strength left...

153
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:52,588
Damn... Damn!

154
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:54,715
Damn... Damn!

155
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,174

00:07:59,094 --> 00:07:59,553
Usopp Pirate crew!!!

159
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:01,847

Listen to me!

00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,105
We won't run away.

164
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,149
He's gone too far!

165
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,483
We'll have our revenge!

166
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:16,278
Protect Kaya!

167
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:21,617
Listen carefully...

168
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,035
I will now...

169
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:25,704
Give the most important mission... to you guys.

170
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:25,746
Give the most important mission... to you guys.

171
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:26,121
Give the most important mission... to you guys.

172
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:26,163
Give the most important mission... to you guys.

173
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:26,413

Give the most important mission... to you guys.

177
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:28,749
Give the most important mission... to you guys.

178
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,543
Get Kaya away from here!

179
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,670
Don't say you can't!

180
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:42,512
Because... protecting what we cherish most as men
is the reason why we formed this pirate crew!

181
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:45,766
Usopp-san...

182
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,775
This is... Captain's order.

183
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:56,944
Aye! Captain!!!

184
00:08:57,611 --> 00:08:58,946
Kaya-san, hurry!

185
00:08:58,946 --> 00:08:59,655
Come, this way!

186
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:00,447
This way!

187
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,783
What an elegant speech...

188
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:05,012
It's the same as telling them to run away.

189
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,913
Going into the forest is like entering my back yard!

190
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,751
Jango!

191
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,378
Oh shit, I blanked out.

192
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:16,088
Are you stupid..?

193
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,049
You'll never get away from me...

194
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:24,763
How's that?

195
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,775
You bastard!

196
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,892
Hurry up and get them, you idiot!

197
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:32,771
Fine!

198
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,525
It's useless...

199
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,904
I know exactly how bad Kaya-ojousama's
condition is.

200
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,949
She won't be able to escape Jango.

201
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,536
You might want to go after them...

202
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,624
If you can walk past this slope that is...

203
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,507
Buchi!

204
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:06,513
You've already lost to me once.

205
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,726
Didn't I tell you not to bother me anymore?!

206
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,312
Outta my way!

207
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:37,252
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

208
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:44,343
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

209
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,758
What... what was that?

210
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:25,592
Who knows...

211
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:30,556
Jango's got them covered, maybe you
should take a look for yourself.

212
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,890
However...

213
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:34,893
You may be too late already.

214
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,273
You bastard...

215
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:42,067
You've been living under the
same roof for three years...

216
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,611
Don't you have any compassion for her?

217
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:45,362
None!

218
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:49,867
Like I said, Kaya is only part of my plan.

219
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:53,370
After her death, I might then thank her.

220
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,583
Why you...

221
00:11:57,624 --> 00:11:59,585
Hopeless bastard.

222
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,545
I didn't plan to save him in the first place.

223
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,798
Usopp!!

224
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,510
You go and look for 'em.

225
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,014
Leave everything here to us.

226
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,141
Leave it to us!

227
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:52,638
Oh, you can still move?

228
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,431
Not bad...

229
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,432
Shut up!

230
00:12:56,253 --> 00:13:00,270
I won't... let you have your way!

231
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:06,360
You dare betray the villagers and Kaya's feelings!

232
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:12,699
Do you think you can simply do as you please?!

233
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:15,244
Usopp!

234
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,333
Damn...

235
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,754
I can't move a limb.

236
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,763
You really amuse me.

237
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,182
I, betrayed them?

238
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,976
Are you kidding me?

239
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,353
Everything was planned.

240
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,858
This isn't like playing some pirate game, where
you'd go around pretending to be the captain!

241
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,945
So just stay put and don't move.

242
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:57,411
Well, even if you do manage to catch up
with Jango, you're no match for him.

243
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,706
You'd be much safer here.

244
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,876
Even if I can't...

245
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,963
Even if I can't, I want to protect...

246
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:10,674
I still want to protect them.

247
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,970
For I am the Captain of the Usopp Pirate crew.

248
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:18,473
I am a brave warrior of the sea!

249
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:24,730
I won't allow you to lay a single
finger on any of the villagers!!!

250
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,569
What's he up to?

251
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,031
What's he yelling for?

252
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:34,031
Yeah look, he's cryin'!

253
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,921
What's so funny?!

254
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:52,507
Luffy!

255
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,510
I'll take Usopp and go after the hypnotist.

256
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:56,762
Any problems?

257
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,222
Nope! Get goin'!

258
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:00,599
Sorry...

259
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,352
It would've been faster if I'd gone alone,

260
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:08,148
but without your help through the forest,
I won't be able to find them.

261
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:13,779
Hey you fools, who gave permission
to get past this slope?

262
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,447
That would be me!

263
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,534
Go! Zoro, Usopp!

264
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,703
One more punch!

265
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:29,586
GOMU GOMU NO...

266
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,672
POWER KICK!

267
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,007
Damn, he vanished again.

268
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,096
Ah well, they did get past.

269
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,808
Before we fight, I'd like to ask one thing.

270
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,563
As an outsider, why are you
getting yourself involved?

271
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,858
Because there's a man here whom
I don't want to see dead.

272
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,196
That's simple. But, is it okay?

273
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,156
For this will be the reason for your death!

274
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:01,577
It's fine, but I'm not gonna die!

275
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,328
Let me show you death!

276
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:12,337
GOMU GOMU NO...

277
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:13,755
WHIP!

278
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:16,550
PISTOL!

279
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,473
I'm getting bored.

280
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,475
You bastard!

281
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,776
Damn, my mouth got cut.

282
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,739
That straw hat guy is definitely strong but...

283
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,825
Th... that's Captain Kuro!

284
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,453
Kill him!

285
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:44,870
Captain! Banzai!

286
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,287
Captain! Banzai!

287
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:45,871
Captain Kuro!

288
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,413
Captain Kuro!

289
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:46,496
Captain Kuro!

290
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:48,624
Great, Captain Kuro!

291
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:51,835
Don't call me by that name!

292
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,089
You still don't get it, do you?

293
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:02,596
For this is... my plan to completely
be rid of the name, ''Captain Kuro''!

294
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,266
I've had enough...

295
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,729
The days when I had to plan everything for you
guys, whom only knew how to make a ruckus!

296
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,980
The days when I had to plan everything for you
guys, whom only knew how to make a ruckus!

297
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,648
The days when I had to plan everything for you
guys, whom only knew how to make a ruckus!

298
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:16,985
Enough of those government dogs who
kept chasing me for the reward!

299
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,531
I can't take it anymore!

300
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,371
Marines...

301
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:31,625
This is the third time this week.

302
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,045
There's nothing we can do.

303
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,590
We keep doing stuff that make us wanted criminals.

304
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,551
And we are somewhat infamous!

305
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:45,973
That's right... it's my name that attracts them to us.

306
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:50,644
That's why, I'm gonna quit being ''Captain Kuro''!

307
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,773
That's a weird thing to say.

308
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:56,775
It's no use.

309
00:17:57,234 --> 00:18:00,445
The Marines will chase you 'til you die.

310
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,952
Then I will die!

311
00:18:08,704 --> 00:18:12,833
It seems like I'm not cut out to be a pirate.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,128
But you are the Captain of this ship.

313
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,213
Then, you be the Captain!

314
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:22,426
I've had enough of this noisy lifestyle.

315
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:26,658
I'll...

316
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:29,558
I'll kill the me in this world!

317
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:31,310
Captain Kuro!

318
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,185
Captain!

319
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:33,061
Capt'!

320
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,105
How many ships do they have?

321
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:36,398
Just one.

322
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,191
What should we do, Capt'?

323
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,235
Should we use our cannons to attack them?

324
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,571
Lower me a small boat.

325
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:43,447
Huh?

326
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,115
A small boat!

327
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:52,915
First Mate Jango, Captain Kuro is...

328
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,124
Yeah, I know.

329
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,586
But, how can he just go there all alone?

330
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:00,255
He's not turning himself in, is he?

331
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,979
What?

332
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,648
They stopped attacking.

333
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:18,982
What happened?

334
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:20,359
This is strange.

335
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,863
Close in.

336
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,740
But...

337
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,910
Just do what I told you!

338
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:30,827
Aye!

339
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:31,796
Hey, prepare the cannons!

340
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,163
I see so thats how its gonnna be...

341
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,998
Be ready to do battle!
I see so thats how its gonnna be...

342
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:35,082
I see so thats how its gonnna be...

343
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,126
Hey you!

344
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,712
Ye... yeah, what is it?

345
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:43,465
I'm sorry to bid you farewell so soon.

346
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:04,945
The Marines are...

347
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,613
All dead!

348
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:15,664
Now...

349
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,421
The plan shall begin.

350
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:29,428
Hey now, get a grip.

351
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,015
I particularly spared your life.

352
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,851
Shu... shut the hell up...

353
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:39,271
I will never beg!

354
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:42,608
Just kill me!

355
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,112
You've got guts.

356
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:51,491
Being able to spew out as much with
a crushed jaw isn't bad at all.

357
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,666
I'll now present to you, a nobody, a little parting gift.

358
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:03,086
You should be honored.

359
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:07,466
To get the head of the devious Kuro.

360
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:10,469
You are Captain Kuro.

361
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,679
You are Captain Kuro.

362
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,724
You're the one who did this.

363
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:19,603
One... Two... Jango!

364
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,105
My name is Captain Kuro.

365
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,150
I killed all these people.

366
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:29,821
And you're the man who caught Captain Kuro.

367
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,783
Return to your base and execute this man.

368
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,311
One... Two... Jango!

369
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:40,874
I'm the man who caught Captain Kuro!!

370
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,751
There he goes again.

371
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,461
This is good.

372
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:51,343
As long as my imposter dies, Captain Kuro will no longer exist in this world.

373
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,058
And so, once today's plan succeeds,

374
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,186
I will have achieved my goal.

375
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,940
I will have money and a tranquil life.

376
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,900
You get it now, kid?

377
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:12,114
This plan which has taken three years will not fail!

378
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:16,743
My plan never fails!

379
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,669
It seems that you can do more
than just stretch yourself.

380
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,505
Of course, I'm well trained...

381
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,382
To be a pirate!

382
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:34,553
You can't take it anymore, you say?!

383
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:38,849
If you're so afraid of the fame on the sea,
then you're not qualified to be a pirate!

384
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,482
If you wanna compare ambitions...

385
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:50,777
Mine is much greater!!!

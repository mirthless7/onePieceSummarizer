1
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:06,840
Good-bye the island of Drum!

2
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:06,840
I take the sea!

3
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,220
Goes now…

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,310
My wire idiot.

5
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,500
Splendid!

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,200
Yes!

7
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,730
Which color.

8
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,040
He… Will that go for Chopper?

9
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,410
It needs to be alone for the moment.

10
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,910
It starts to include/understand what is “to follow its destiny”.

11
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,410
It forever left this island of all its life.

12
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,360
And from now on, it leaves it behind him.

13
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,620
I am my way.

14
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,400
Doctor, Doctorine.

15
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,640
It finally will be able to start.

16
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,420
My… ventures!

17
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,290
I adore it! I adore it!

18
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,900
The moon is shown and the cherry tree flowers!

19
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,590
Chopper!

20
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,710
He, Chopper!

21
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,540
Imbecile, how long you will remain there sitted to daydream?!

22
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,460
Wood.

23
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,780
Eh, come to sing with me!

24
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,010
Go, tries to put these rods in your nose!

25
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,000
Ah, what a beautiful cherry tree!

26
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,280
It is not funny if one does not sing!

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,930
I frightened you?

28
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,720
Now you are the companion of one crowned band of kids.

29
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,350
Sing! Sing!

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,540
A companion?

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,220
It is the best!

32
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,110
Yes, they do not have the least direction of the responsibilities, but they are your companions now.

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,690
You will have to learn how to know them, of agreement?

34
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,660
Karu! Why you went in this cold river?!

35
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,510
Ha ha, it probably had to slip and fall inside.

36
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,750
The moron!

37
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,780
Keep silent yourself, Mr. Bushido!

38
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,160
He said that named Zoro went to swim in the river.

39
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,480
And when he saw that he did not return, he was afraid that something arrived,

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,860
then it jumped in water to go to help it and it is there that it has cold.

41
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,660
It was thus of your fault!

42
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,650
Do Tony-Kun, you include/understand what Karu known as?

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,650
Yes, at the base I am an animal.

44
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,200
Thus I can communicate with other animals.

45
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,140
You can speak with the animals?

46
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,180
It is brilliant, Chopper!

47
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,370
In addition to your medical capacities, you also have this faculty!

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,140
Idiot!

49
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,160
I do not like that one compliments me like that!

50
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,540
Small stupid!

51
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,970
However, it with the rather content air.

52
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,990
With do the fact, Nami, what you understand by “medical capacities”?

53
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,660
Chopper is a doctor.

54
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,120
It is Dr. Kureha who taught all to him that it knew of medicine.

55
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,540
It is a doctor of first order!

56
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,970
WHAT?!

57
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,240
Chopper, be to you doctor?!

58
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,900
Super!

59
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,770
You pleasant!

60
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,140
Imbecile! And why did you invite Chopper to join us?

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,450
Seven levels of transformation.
It is a super reindeer.

62
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,970
Food of help.

63
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,910
Oh not!

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,300
I was so in a hurry to leave that I forgot to take my case of care!

65
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,030
Good Ah? But then it is what this trick?

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,760
My backpack!

67
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,530
It was on the sledge.

68
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,540
How?

69
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,990
What do you want to say by there?

70
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,790
It is not you who ace prepared your business for the voyage?

71
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,840
At the end of the day…

72
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,780
She pertinently knew what there was at the bottom of your heart.

73
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,420
It is really a marvellous person.

74
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,150
Ah! Droppings of nose in the airs!

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,180
Yes.

76
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,530
Go! Take that!

77
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,260
Do not stop you!

78
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,650
He, Chopper!

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,740
Also, tests you!

80
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,310
You me master keys rods?

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,480
Frankly!

82
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,700
They make any really only at their head!

83
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,470
Sanji!

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,530
Divide it in two! 'silvering release me!

85
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,150
Well, Chopper!

86
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,510
Chopper?

87
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,280
Thus test, salts cook!

88
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,900
DO NOT MAKE CA!

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,570
WELL!

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,750
He, morons!

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,260
LET US CLINK GLASSES!

92
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,050
What you said ace, jerk?!

93
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,320
You ace of course, I have known as salts cook to you!

94
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,970
I would like to introduce our new companion to you…

95
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,320
Sanji, of the meat!

96
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,480
… Tony Tony Chopper!

97
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,850
You know…

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,520
As a ship's doctor, the responsibilities for Chopper will be…

99
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,600
YOU LISTEN TO Me, BAND Of IDIOTS!?

100
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,430
He the morons, I try to speak!

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,810
Whore, will you stop beating you?

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,660
You know…

103
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,920
He you, the oaf!?

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,650
Go shit! Let finish to me!

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,770
It is really the very first time that I have fun as much!

106
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,650
They is cool!

107
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,100
With our new companion! Health!

108
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,850
GO!

109
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,670
HEALTH!

110
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,550
Eh well, I suppose that it was time for him to leave the island.

111
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
This reindeer has good heart and it has the capacities of a very eminent doctor.

112
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,350
Hiluluk gave its life so that the cherry trees flower.

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,040
It is perhaps the reason for which this inexperienced reindeer decided to take the sea.

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,970
He… became a man.

115
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,130
He will become a good ship's doctor.

116
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,870
Eh well? What do you hope to make now?

117
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,960
I…

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:35,230
I owe expier the faults which I made as a Commander of the guard of Wapol.

119
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,810
I should leave and entrust the good walk of the country to the people.

120
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,910
It is what I intended to do.

121
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,670
And… you always have the intention of it?

122
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,730
Not.

123
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,160
I realized that while leaving, I would not make amend.

124
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,910
The collapse of the old kingdom will be able to leave room to the awakening of a new nation.

125
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,410
If I remain, I will be able to then make in kind help with the construction of a nation.

126
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,150
I believe that in this way, I will be able to repair my faults.

127
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,930
Hmm, always a kid.

128
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,000
Your heart is always attached to this country.

129
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,080
A heart attached to its country…

130
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,510
A long time ago, a ten year old young girl showed me what it was.

131
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,220
Mariejoie, Holy Land

132
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,950
Bah… Still a world council…

133
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,530
Ca still will be an useless and tedious meeting.

134
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,440
Yes, probably.

135
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,650
Is the Kingdom of Drum on the right track?

136
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,650
The rupture enters the King and the people nothing but do increase more and more.

137
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,670
Oh!

138
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,950
It is the King of the Kingdom of Arabasta!

139
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,150
Nefertari Cobra-Sama…

140
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,650
It is the wise one and benevolent King d' Arabasta.

141
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,260
Dragon, the revolutionist.

142
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,730
The ideologies of this man are dangerous!

143
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:11,400
From here five or six years, it inevitably will represent a serious threat with the World Government.

144
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,630
Which fabric of conneries.

145
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,260
That does not relate to of anything my kingdom.

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,420
I will not waste my time with this “revolutionist” and his political opinions badly inspired.

147
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,240
If you want to capture it, band of morons, that will be without me!

148
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,980
WAPOL!

149
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,770
Species of large oaf egocentric person!

150
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,180
Why you believe that this top takes place?!

151
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,720
Give a your opinion more with the serious one.

152
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,260
Nefertari Cobra!

153
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,170
Bah! This meeting was really the worst of all.

154
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,280
It is. !

155
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,240
It is the girl of this snotty-nosed kid of Cobra!

156
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,920
Oups! My hand slipped!

157
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
WAPOL-SAMA!

158
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,700
Vivi-Sama!

159
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,630
Excuse me!

160
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,360
Hold, would not be this the Princess of Arabasta?

161
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,580
Ca must be hard to be the girl of such an unimportant King!

162
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,230
Salt dog! What takes to you?!

163
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,520
Stopstop please, Igaram!

164
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
I am well!

165
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,100
It is with me to excuse me.
I am sorry to have hustled to you.

166
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,890
Which extraordinary child…

167
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,430
With the presence of all the kings brought together in this same place,

168
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,870
even a small incident as this one could start a war.

169
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,960
Was it contained with full knowledge of the facts?

170
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,320
It is however so young…

171
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,370
Salt small morveuse!

172
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,860
Allons-y, Dalton!

173
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,430
Afflicted.

174
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,420
Ca hurts…!

175
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,090
You were very strong, Vivi-Sama.

176
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,590
The Princess who is attached to her country…

177
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,400
For this day, it has remained the same one.

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,530
It became somebody of good.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,750
Dalton-Kun.

180
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,030
Our hearts also are always attached to this country.

181
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,000
Say to us what we must do…

182
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,910
in the interest of this new country.

183
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,590
Hiluluk.

184
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,370
This country will be able to reappear.

185
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,680
Just like did it your sons, Chopper.

186
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,290
DALTON-SAN!

187
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,920
It is horrible!

188
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,460
I have just remembered an important thing!

189
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,320
What thus?

190
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
Look by yourself!

191
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,460
It is him!

192
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,940
The pirate with the straw hat which eliminated Wapol!

193
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,180
Ca is not any doubt!

194
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,170
A reward of 30.000.000 Berry…?
For its head?

195
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,720
Ca with the air to be a truth hard to cook.

196
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,270
Where did you find?

197
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,130
I forgot to speak to you about it when it arrived, but…

198
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,910
Approximately a week ago, in the town of Robelle,

199
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,660
this strange traveller arrived of nowhere.

200
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,380
Oddly this day, it did not snow at all…

201
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,100
We did not have really any idea from where devil it could come!

202
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,120
Always it is that he said being to the continuation of Black Beard, the same pirate who put at bag our country.

203
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,240
But when it was said to him that there were no more pirates here for a long time…

204
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,530
In this case, I have another question.

205
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,130
You would not have seen a pirate wearing a straw hat in trimmings, by chance?

206
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,660
When I said to him that not, it gave us this poster and added:

207
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,950
If it comes in the corner…

208
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,670
If it comes…?

209
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,490
Say to him that I will await it during ten days with Arabasta.

210
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,290
I let to you undertake some.

211
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,880
He, wait a little!

212
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,410
Which is your name?

213
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,510
Ah yes.

214
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,150
It is true, I were going to forget.

215
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,510
I am called Ace.

216
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,390
When it passes, say the-him and it will include/understand.

217
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,500
OHE! THAT SOMEBODY CATCHES THIS GUY!

218
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,810
He left without paying the addition!

219
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,450
DO NOT FORGET ESPECIALLY!

220
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,660
He will await it during ten days with Arabasta?

221
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,670
Dr. Kureha.

222
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,940
What is there?

223
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,010
You have the air thoughtful.

224
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,090
Do you know Gol D. Roger?

225
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,120
“D”?

226
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,030
You want to speak about Gold Roger?

227
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,490
Thus it is called, now.

228
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,630
It would be said that…

229
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,350
… my small reindeer left with hard to cook.

230
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,310
Then it is always present…

231
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,460
Will of D…

232
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,130
It is really brilliant!

233
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,610
The ocean is immense!

234
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,470
Obviously!

235
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,630
To leave to the adventure on an immense ocean, it is that the life of a pirate!

236
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,550
I see!
To be a pirate, it is really exceptional!

237
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,260
He! It is what that?

238
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,310
It is a gull!

239
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,960
How a gull can be also imposing?

240
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,000
He, the gull!

241
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,700
IT ARRIVES!

242
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,160
What had I said?
It is well a gull.

243
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,470
There is not the question!

244
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,980
Because of you, it sinks right on us, now!

245
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,180
Wow! An great adventure!

246
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,470
Wait, where passed Luffy?

247
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,450
CAUTION!
You will be made puff out!

248
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,020
With the assistance!
Luffy will be made puff out!

249
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,090
It is not the moment to play charts!

250
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,070
Luffy will be made puff out!

251
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,300
Did he ask of the assistance?

252
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,540
Not.

253
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,770
Then all is well.

254
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,640
Leave it démerder.

255
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,280
But…

256
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,290
Wow…

257
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,320
He, Sanji!

258
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,530
I found us meat.

259
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,870
What you made, the guy?
You roupillez or what?

260
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,650
It IS OF MT FAULT, CRETIN!

261
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,090
How hope you to refund me?!

262
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,720
I had a good hand for once!

263
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,200
Oh I see. Afflicted!

264
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,050
Wow, super.

265
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,670
One finally will be able to have a true meal.

266
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,930
Does Ca eat that?

267
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,060
Is Eh, what there, Chopper?

268
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,030
Eh well…

269
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,010
I find…

270
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,500
That to be a pirate it is…

271
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,850
That to be a pirate it is…

272
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,520
They is super!

273
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,280
You said it, they are super!

274
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,920
He, you!

275
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,870
One soon will accost in Arabasta.

276
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,100
There are not time to have fun.

277
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,800
You dispatch.

278
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,830
Ouais, one arrives.

279
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,960
Said, it is what Arabasta?

280
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,170
It is the country which the father of Vivi directs.

281
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,500
A démoniaque guy called Crocodile tries to reverse his capacity.

282
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,580
And Crocodile is one of the 7 Shichibukai.

283
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,300
Shichibukai?

284
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,790
They are pirates with the pay of the World Government.

285
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,980
A pirate with the pay of the Government?

286
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,340
Yes, they are really very powerful!

287
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,470
They furrow the seas to eliminate from other pirates.

288
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,270
This is why controlling them give them capacity in exchange of their services.

289
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,270
Crocodile, hein?

290
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,710
I am in a hurry to meet it!

291
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,390
Crocodile is regarded as a hero with Arabasta.

292
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,900
It protects the cities against any pirate raid.

293
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,600
But it is right a cover.

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,900
In the shade, it prepares a coup d'etat in Arabasta.

295
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,920
He wants to seize the throne of Arabasta.

296
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,720
But nobody is with the current…

297
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,600
Nor people…

298
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,740
Nor even my father…

299
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,820
Well!

300
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,430
One needs just botter the bottom of this Crocodile, not true?

301
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,820
Yes. If we manage to stop his coup d'etat, then we will be able to put an end to Baroque Works.

302
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,380
Works baroque…

303
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,110
It is true, you do not know them either, hein?

304
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,900
Eh well, I do not know any much more.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,110
The system of Works Baroque is too complex.

306
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,850
In fact, their system is rather simple.

307
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,950
At the top, there are the Boss, Crocodile.

308
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,260
Alias “Mr. 0”.

309
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,540
Then, there are thirteen “Agents” which are directly under its orders.

310
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,470
There are twelve men and an animal.

311
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,750
They are associated with a female agent which comes complémenter their capacities.

312
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,360
Mr. 1 and Doublefinger Miss.

313
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,490
Mr. 2 is the only agent not having a binomial.

314
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,690
Is Mr. 3 the man candle whom we met in Little Garden, it is that?

315
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,810
Yes, it is associated with Miss Goldenweek.

316
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,690
Ah, this child.

317
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,250
Mr. 4 is associated with Miss Merry Christmas.

318
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,030
To tell the truth, I do not have many information on these deux-là.

319
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,050
And then, there is Mr. 5, the man with droppings of nose.

320
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,800
Droppings of nose?

321
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,530
Ouais, its droppings of nose are true bombs.

322
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,260
In fact, all the body of Mr. 5 is a weapon.

323
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,550
And Valentine Miss has the capacities of the Fruit Kilo Kilo.

324
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,210
It is this woman who can change her weight at will?

325
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,950
All the Agents to Mr. 5 are called “the Agents Officers”.

326
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,180
They have all of the capacities of a Fruit of the Demon.

327
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,940
They act only when one mission is of extreme importance.

328
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,130
And then, that goes from Mr. 6 to Mr. 13.

329
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,160
Their work consists in directing the employees who collect funds for the organization with the doors of Large Line.

330
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,660
Now that I think of it, I met a strange otter and a chicken.

331
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,410
You must surely speak about Mr. 13 and Friday Miss.

332
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,700
They are executors.

333
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,050
They deal with all those which missed with their duties.

334
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,870
Moreover, the “Agents Officers” have under their called subordinated orders 200 “Billions”.

335
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,610
And the “Agents Borders” as for them subordinated 1.800 under their orders called “Million”.

336
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,450
Here what is the underground criminal organization “Works Baroque”.

337
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,790
Then if I make the made account, 1.800 and 200 that…

338
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,470
Ca makes 2.000 people?!

339
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,600
2.000?!

340
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,610
Well! I know now.

341
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,430
It is necessary just that I boot the bottom of this Crocodile, not true?

342
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,770
You ace really nothing measuring rod with the situation, hein?

343
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,390
If the intention of Works Baroque is to seize the capacity of Arabasta…

344
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,660
Then the remainder of the Agents Officers must all be…

345
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,920
… gathered in Arabasta.

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,100
Yes.

347
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,120
It is simple! I just will burst this Crocodile…

348
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,810
It is good now, one included/understood.

349
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,510
Ah?

350
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,410
One, Two.

351
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,560
THREE!

352
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,690
One, Two.

353
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,660
THREE!!

354
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Please, forgive me!
Mr. 2, Good Clay-Sama!

355
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,110
Stop of you foutre of me!

356
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,190
With which believe you to be addressed?!

357
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,680
I am Bon Clay-Sama, the Agent Officer of Works Baroque which can put an end to the tears of the children.

358
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,400
And you, you are a vulgar navigator!

359
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes!

360
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,660
Points out to me which were the orders of Zero-Chan?

361
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,560
To intercept Mr. 3 on the direct way between Arabasta and Little Garden, and to remove it!

362
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,260
Oh, then you see, when you want.

363
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,530
In is direct way, there “direct”, not?

364
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,710
Thus we came directly from Arabasta in Little Garden, not true?

365
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:26,630
Then why we did not cross Mr. 3
on the road between Arabasta and Little Garden?!

366
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:31,660
Does that want to say that you let spin the boat of Mr. 3?!

367
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,450
Not… It is impossible…

368
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,600
Then you want to insinuate that it is entirely my fault?

369
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,970
Not, Mr. 2…!

370
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,930
Then it closes!

371
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:47,620
In any event, one cannot fail in this mission “Of removing especially Mr. 3” at such an important time!

372
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,250
The failure cannot be tolerated. If we fail, Mr. 1 and his binomial will be sent to remove me!

373
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,810
YOU INCLUDED/UNDERSTOOD?!

374
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,480
If you do not want to die, then you may find it beneficial with me to find it!

375
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,140
Mr. 3…

376
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,120
HOW THE SWANDA PUTS FULL CAPE ON ARABASTA AND AHEAD ALL!

377
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,170
It IS INCLUDED/UNDERSTOOD?!

378
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,110
And do not let pass only one boat!

379
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,530
YES!

380
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,090
Mr. 2, Good Clay-Sama!

381
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,180
What?

382
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,040
Do pirates pose problems in the Kingdom?

383
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,110
They thus do not know that they are on my grounds?

384
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,800
Who knows? Sir Crocodile.

385
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,000
A country right in the middle of a civil war is being a target of choice for a pirate.

386
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,450
You leave?

387
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,490
Yes, I must achieve my duty, after all.

388
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,900
Which kindness of heart you have there.

389
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,130
It is very natural.

390
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,830
Shichibukai are pirates who carry out other pirates.

391
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,660
They are the heroes of the people.

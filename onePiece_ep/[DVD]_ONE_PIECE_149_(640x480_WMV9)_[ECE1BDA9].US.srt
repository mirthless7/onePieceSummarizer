1
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:59,520
Cape on the clouds!
To find the Bird of the South!

2
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,110
What do you want to say to us, papi?

3
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,920
Listen, the guy.

4
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,990
To start, I will say to you
all that I know about the celestial island.

5
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,210
I do not know if it is veracious,

6
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,530
thus free with you to believe me or not.

7
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,050
Ok, I believe you.

8
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,760
Not already!

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,200
It occurs a strange phenomenon
in this part of the ocean.

10
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,120
The night falls down sometimes suddenly
in full day on part of the sea.

11
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,310
It was seen!

12
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,820
Ca arrived to us!

13
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,550
Not true?

14
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,280
Ouais!

15
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,470
The night fell,

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,460
And a whole heap of monsters emerged!

17
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,250
You speak about the colossi?

18
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,180
There is a theory
interesting on their origin.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,790
But let us pass for the moment.

20
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,530
This sudden fallen
from night is explained by…

21
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,700
darkness caused by
the accumulation of cloudy masses.

22
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,440
They would be cumulonimbus?

23
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,320
But of the clouds cannot
to create such black darkness.

24
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,620
Papi, be too stupid for you!

25
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,000
When there are clouds,
it is said that it is covered!

26
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,370
Ouaip, a covered time!

27
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,280
Cover!

28
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,540
CLOSE IT AND
LISTEN TO me!

29
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,800
Impérionimbus… It is like
that which one calls these clouds.

30
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,230
They accumulate with very high-altitude, but cause neither rain, nor airstreams.

31
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,350
Only, when they appear…

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,020
they block the light completely of
sun, and the day becomes night ici-bas.

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,780
A theory claims that them
impérionimbus would be…

34
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,700
clouds “fossilized” after having wandered
in the sky during thousands of years.

35
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,550
Like petrified clouds.

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,170
It is impossible!

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,030
No cloud is formed without
to create airstreams!

38
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,880
Free with you not to believe in it.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,540
I already said it to you.

40
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,660
Approximately, they is magic clouds.

41
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,850
One can say that.

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,940
Science still does not explain them.

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,500
Luffy, it is brilliant!

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,650
You include/understand? If the island
celestial exists indeed…

45
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,520
it can be only over there!

46
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,960
Oh, of agreement!

47
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,750
Direction clouds!

48
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,470
Zoro, awakes!

49
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,650
Already the morning?

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,550
Cape on the clouds! All
the world at its station!

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,480
Cape on the clouds! Ahead all!

52
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,800
Ahead all! Cape on
clouds! Thank you for the pipe, papi!

53
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,490
Ahead all! Ahead
all! Ahead all!

54
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,490
HOW MUCH TIME I WILL SAY TO YOU
THAT ONE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO GO THERE?!

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,750
Let us pass to the serious things.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,700
Let warn you to me that
you will have to risk your lives!

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,290
One is already with half dead…

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Knock-Up Stream, it is
the vertical current…

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,950
that you will have to succeed in taking
to go on the celestial island.

60
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,750
Here is the theory, measuring rod?

61
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,600
It is a kind of geyser which will propel
is our boat in the airs, it that?

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,750
Oh! Then, one has just with
to fly away above the clouds!

63
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,530
An ascending marine current?

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,000
But, one intended to say that the boats which
took fell down to be crushed on the ocean.

65
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,600
In general, yes.

66
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,510
It is a question of timing.

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,530
At first sight, that can seem
easy to take a marine current.

68
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,450
But I ensure you that it is
far from being a nice cruising.

69
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,400
To fall on Knock-Up
Stream is a disaster.

70
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,750
Usually, one seeks
to avoid it at all costs.

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,800
But how a marine current
can it go up towards the sky?

72
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,890
I never heard
to speak about such a phenomenon.

73
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,150
Exact.

74
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,300
There still, there is not
of scientific explanation some.

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,950
But you will not find anybody
of enough insane to go to check.

76
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,000
Here the theory:

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,120
There would be a vast cavity
underwater, a such air pocket…

78
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,600
in which would engulf themselves
basic water temperature.

79
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,590
The heat of the earth's crust
would transform into vapor….

80
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,530
whose pressure would cause
an underwater explosion.

81
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:46,000
The powerful breath would generate one
running marine rising to the skies.

82
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,300
During one surroundings minute,
sky and sea communicate together.

83
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,450
One minute?!

84
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,800
It an explosion must be needed
titanic to produce such a geyser!

85
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,390
The explosions do not occur
never at the same places.

86
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,050
And there are only five per month of them.

87
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,410
It is a blow with
to make put in part…

88
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,310
Lastly, at all events, it is
a fantastic natural phenomenon.

89
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,700
One does not explain it with
great words or of beautiful theories.

90
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,530
But then…

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,700
This marine current which
proclamation that five times per month…

92
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,510
is the only means
to reach the celestial island?

93
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,200
Ouais, and the risks are enormous.

94
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,300
If you do not find anything up there,

95
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,850
You will be crushed with
the surface of the ocean…

96
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,350
And you will finish all in charpie.

97
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,150
O-Ok!

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
One drops the celestial island!

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,350
It is madness!

100
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,150
Listen to me!

101
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,580
Would be necessary to be hyper hyper hyper hyper
ultra lucky mega to arrive there!

102
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,700
Do not make any you! Allons-y!

103
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,900
I was sure.

104
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,900
What amn't I done any?
You of ace the good ones, you…

105
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,150
You ace that to throw an eye
on the Vogue-Merry!

106
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,350
You is ace seen in which state it?

107
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,520
He would not survive an adventure
similar under these conditions!

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,250
It is true. Even very new, this hull
nut could never do it!

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,350
WHAT?!

110
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,580
Speed, weight, resistance…

111
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,750
this tub would be immediately
put in part by the explosion.

112
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,450
M… But…

113
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,250
You see?

114
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,780
As I said it, it is impossible.

115
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,530
But of made you not for that.

116
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,650
Masira and Shoujo go
you to help to repair it.

117
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,780
Of course, they go
to reinforce its structure.

118
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,430
Ouais! Let make us, the guy!

119
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,700
Thank you, they is cool!

120
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,800
Is necessary always that they make some too much…

121
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,500
Do you know what you do?

122
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,100
Ben what?

123
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,220
And Ben, to start…

124
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,210
Ah yes!

125
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,610
One cannot remain on this
island that until maximum tomorrow.

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,150
At the end of this period, the Log Installation will be put at
to indicate the direction of the next island.

127
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,950
It is that! It is that!

128
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,400
Even time is against us!

129
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,800
He, papi!

130
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,700
I know that are not to you a soothsayer, and
you do not know of it surely anything, but…

131
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:05,350
this When-is that place will have
next Knock-Up Stream?

132
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,590
Not, not, not, not, not,
in how much month, rather?

133
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,450
Or in how much years?

134
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,550
Tomorrow afternoon. You would make well
to begin your preparations immediately.

135
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,700
THEN ONE WILL DO IT?!

136
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,700
Ben what?

137
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,850
Is not necessary there to go if you do not want.

138
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,090
You lie!

139
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,440
Y has eel under rock there!

140
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,830
One hardly knows oneself!

141
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,840
And you would not be a little too friendly?!

142
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,490
E-and it is not all…

143
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,980
Eh, Usopp!

144
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,350
You, the farm!

145
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,530
This celestial island…

146
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,270
Our only chance to reach this legendary island which one does not even know the site…

147
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,900
… it is tomorrow?!

148
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,340
And you propose even your assistance
to repair our boat?!

149
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,830
It is too beautiful to be true!

150
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,020
Thus acknowledge what you schemes!

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,450
The blood of Norland the Liar runs
in your veins, it is well that?!

152
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,250
One cannot trust you!

153
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,730
BOSS!

154
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,700
The dinner is been useful…!

155
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,850
You move!

156
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,220
Nami-swan!

157
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,530
The dinner is ready!

158
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,530
Q-that this is
that you ace?!

159
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,900
T you want to fight?

160
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,800
Masira noticed…

161
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,470
that when the night falls down
suddenly on its territory…

162
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,430
impérionimbus are formed
in the South the next day.

163
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,590
Therefore, taking into account the cycle
of five times per month…

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,340
I think that there will be one
Knock-Up Stream tomorrow.

165
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,150
And that should also be in the South.

166
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,150
I guaranteed nothing…

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,450
but there are strong chances
so that occurs tomorrow.

168
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,850
Ca pleases to me to have met
a band of nuts like you.

169
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,330
Go, pass to table!

170
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,950
I offer to you my
hospitality for this night…

171
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,310
Friends.

172
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,820
With table! Usopp, is brought back!

173
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,450
Ouais, you grouillez!

174
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,100
Chopper, will seek Robin-chan!

175
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,680
Ok!

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,550
One would make well test
of sympatiser with him.

177
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,650
If we want to go in the sky.

178
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
But in the final analysis, it
will be a question of chance.

179
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,800
Nami…

180
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,350
You find that I am
a wet hen?

181
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
Doubled of a perfect cretin.

182
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,850
I know what you feel.

183
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,080
You should excuse you.

184
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,650
OWNER, I AM SORRY!

185
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,660
Mr.-MR.-but what you
tell, brothel? What a rough!

186
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
Does not approach me with
your nose full with snot!

187
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,040
Moron!

188
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,000
Good god, rum is
delicious, today!

189
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,250
Go, eat! Empiffrez you!

190
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,310
Y has sardine with
will and it is not all!

191
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,190
And here!

192
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,160
Fell to you into
panel, face of repechor!

193
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
It was my Bomb in Tabasco!

194
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,840
RETURN HERE, LONG-PIF!

195
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,290
He, thus come to sit you
with me, soeurette!

196
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,330
Dumb! You ace hundred years of
too much to dredge Nami-san!

197
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,750
The right eye of cranium…

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,770
I saw gold through.

199
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,590
Gold?

200
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,330
Filled up tears, such were them
last words that Norland wrote.

201
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,270
“I saw gold through
the right eye of cranium. “

202
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,090
It was the day when Norland was carried out.

203
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,470
Even since my arrival with Jaya, I
still the direction of these words does not include/understand.

204
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,130
The right eye of cranium…

205
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,520
It is perhaps the name of one
antique quoted now disappeared.

206
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,850
Unless it is not about one
metaphor on its own imminent death.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,750
The white pages which follow
do not give any explanation.

208
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,330
It is for that one plunges!

209
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,700
With the continuation of the dream!

210
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,180
At the bottom of the seas!

211
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,140
Ouais!

212
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,800
One will fly away!

213
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,820
One will never fly away
if you puff out as much!

214
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,280
The night settled well.

215
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,110
But one can see the coast, Bellamy.

216
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,000
You with the unloading prepare!

217
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,400
Not question of leaving good but to mildew
between the hands of stupid dreamers!

218
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,420
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

219
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,850
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

220
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,200
“Today, I accosted on Jaya.”

221
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,500
“May 21st, 1122.”

222
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,710
Norland! Norland!

223
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,910
“Hardly we put foot
with ground, which we heard… “

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,810
“… the strange cry of one
bird coming from the forest… “

225
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,540
“… interfered with the sound one
large, very large bell. “

226
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,480
“The sound of a pure gold bell…”

227
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,800
“… which resounded with
through all the island… “

228
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,790
“… like testifying to
prosperity of the antique quoted. “

229
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,900
“On this immense ocean, this fugacious sound
proved that a splendid civilization… “

230
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,500
“… opened out
since generations. “

231
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,010
Norland! Norland!

232
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,920
“For us and our some
decades of existence… “

233
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,520
“… there was not
words to describe it! “

234
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,450
“The sound resounding of
bell cut us the breath! “

235
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,070
Superb history, Norland!

236
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,190
A gold bell! I dream some!

237
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,750
Does owner, what that want to say?

238
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,950
In the final analysis, like you Norland!

239
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,950
Look at that!

240
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,090
Ouah! A gold bell!

241
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,240
In what is it so enormous?

242
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,100
It is not the bell about which he spoke.

243
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,530
It is right an ingot run in form of
bell. I found three at the bottom of water of them.

244
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,530
Ingots?

245
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,930
Then, the Gold City
indeed existed!

246
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,530
Ca proves anything, you know.

247
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,530
Ca can be in
any ruin.

248
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,530
But that proves that there is
well have a civilization here.

249
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,530
An ingot is a block of corresponding gold
with certain criteria of weight.

250
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,460
What means that it there
also trade had here.

251
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,480
Exact, and the cry of
this strange animal…

252
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,420
Eh, Masira.

253
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,200
Ouah, still has there!

254
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,530
It is large that one!

255
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,530
It is all that one A.

256
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,530
Ah, it is splendid!

257
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,800
A made a gold bell and bird.

258
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,150
Ca was to be them
symbols of Jaya formerly.

259
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,250
I wonder whether it is not only one
part of a larger unit.

260
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,200
It is a Bird of the South, and it
lives precisely here, on this island.

261
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,330
And is its cry odd?

262
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,290
Ouais, like writing in the newspaper.

263
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,050
In old times, one was useful oneself
birds of the South aboard ships for…

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,850
GOOD BLOOD!!

265
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,510
What!? What there is?!

266
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,500
Ca fears!

267
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,710
You must go in the forest!

268
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,350
The forest in the South!

269
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,960
Hein? Which fly has you piqué, papi?

270
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,630
It is necessary to capture one of these birds!

271
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,800
Immediately!

272
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,350
Hein? Does it like?

273
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
This sparrow? But why?

274
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,520
Listen to me well.

275
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,700
Tomorrow you will face
Knock-Up Stream!

276
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,800
You will have to go full South.

277
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,520
But how you count
you to return there?!

278
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,040
Ben, while going straight pardi.

279
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,430
One is on Grand Line!

280
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,750
Once at sea, it will be to you
impossible to locate you!

281
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,320
Ah yes. It is true that our objective is not
not an island but a point on the open sea.

282
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,170
No compass will be able to help us.

283
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,350
But then how can one make?

284
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,430
You will need
assets of this bird.

285
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,420
Certain animals are equipped with one
natural direction of the orientation…

286
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,950
who allows them
to always know where they are.

287
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Then that wants to say that Zoro is
still stupider than a bird!

288
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,530
Be to you really badly
placed to speak, you!

289
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,610
The Bird of the South is it
more astonishing of them.

290
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,180
It does not matter the extent of the grounds
or the agitation of the sea…

291
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,120
Its body will be always
turned in the same direction.

292
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,800
In short, without this bird, you
would never reach that point.

293
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,480
And you will not have the shade of one
chance to reach the celestial island!

294
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,280
AND It IS ONLY NOW
THAT YOU TELL US CA?!

295
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,850
There remain not planted!

296
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,790
Time presses! You move!

297
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,900
It makes black night and you want that one
will walk in wood?!

298
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,280
You forget that!

299
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,590
One deals with repairing your boat.

300
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,870
It was not the moment of
to feast in any event!

301
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,180
You could not say it earlier?!

302
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,880
Listen well!

303
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,100
You must capture a Bird of
South and to bring back it here before the paddle!

304
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,890
Nothing there is seen!

305
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,710
Release me, cretin!

306
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,800
O-Oui, I know, but…

307
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,790
My hands… do not want…

308
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,520
I ate so much that
I do not manage to walk.

309
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,530
I will have evil
to capture this bird.

310
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,410
Good, it is where this bird
odd? Odd bird…

311
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,970
Grouillons us to catch
this sparrow and let us turn over drinking!

312
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,440
How things
can they turn also badly?

313
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,030
Move!

314
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,090
Zut, one could not make
did that when it make day?

315
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,820
Is Eh, it where this bird?

316
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,290
If one knew, one would be
not there with galérer!

317
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,860
All that one knows, it is
that it has funny cry.

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,790
And it resembles the form of
gold ingot of presently.

319
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,490
Ca exists really a sparrow
with a similar mug?

320
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,500
And then, “funny of
cry ", it is too vague!

321
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,530
How
will one make?

322
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,530
Ben, it said that once in
forest, one could not be mistaken…

323
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,930
This old man…

324
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,110
OUAH! What a funny of cry!

325
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,200
No the doubt.

326
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,430
Perfect!

327
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,680
Now that one is
there, as much to take care some.

328
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,770
There are three scoops.

329
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,530
We into three separate
groups and let us seek!

330
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,510
OK!

331
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,530
It left!

332
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,410
One goes him botter the bottom to this sparrow!

333
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,700
But not, it is needed
to capture, it is all!

334
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,840
Would be without fear.

335
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,510
I would protect you from all
dangers, Nami-san!

336
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,910
Sanji-kun, and me then?

337
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,130
I have anything with foutre you of it!

338
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,520
Stop a little pleurnicher!

339
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,660
Dispatch we to capture one of
these birds and let us leave this forest!

340
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,700
Tendons well the ear to test
to locate from which its cry comes!

341
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,910
Jiyoooo!

342
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,750
This cry!

343
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,330
Jiyooo! Small, small, small! Jiyoooo!

344
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,330
Cretin!

345
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,830
Jiyoooo!

346
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,390
Why you catch me?

347
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,890
Oh, Nami! It is pretty
specimen that you have there!

348
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,900
You found it where?

349
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,860
About what you do speak?

350
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,200
A SPIDER!

351
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
Ben what? It is that a spider.

352
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,320
Poor small bébête. Come-there!

353
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,610
I AI HORROR OF the SPIDERS, MORON!

354
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,230
BALANCE THIS TRICK FAR FROM!

355
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,830
Moved away from it, Usopp!

356
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,090
It is perhaps poisonous!

357
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,750
They fall from the trees!

358
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,910
It IS WRETCHED!

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,520
Be to you a kind of
is tarantula, it well that?

360
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,480
You do not worry!

361
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,390
Since I do not irritate it
not, it will not bite me!

362
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,530
I have the practice of me
to beat with spiders!

363
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,290
What a abomination! These
small beasts are feeling reluctant!

364
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,540
With which say it you! I hate that!

365
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,810
Balance it! Immediately! Go!

366
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:00,230
Good Ah? You prefer the butterflies
and the millepede behind you?

367
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,750
NOOON! It IS STILL PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!

368
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,930
DO NOT LEAVE ME ALL ALONE!

369
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,510
I heard howls.

370
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,680
Occupy you.

371
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,680
A scolopendre.

372
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,980
He is really hefty man.

373
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,530
Avoid killing all them
creatures which one crosses.

374
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,710
The poor animals.

375
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,390
Had that with step to cause me.

376
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,520
But…

377
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,530
What still?

378
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,630
You set out again on our steps there.

379
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,930
The cry of the bird.

380
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,130
By here!

381
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,260
Caution! The ground is spongy, here.

382
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,060
Eh!

383
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,010
Await me!

384
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,770
I hold it!

385
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,040
Look at, Chopper!

386
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,240
It is an atlas!

387
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,470
An atlas?

388
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,330
Ouais!

389
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,460
In the whole world, the atlas is one of
the most required beetles with the hercules!

390
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,620
Beetles kabuto?

391
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,820
You do not know?

392
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,510
One cannot catch it by the head!

393
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,810
It is still better than One Piece?

394
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,090
Ahhh… Not easy to say!

395
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,760
Luffy! There is another here.

396
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,910
It is Miyama!

397
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,510
It CATCHES!

398
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,230
It flew away!

399
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,530
One runs to him afterwards!

400
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,230
Does not let escape!

401
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,940
A swarm! CASSOOOS!

402
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,470
It IS WHAT THIS DRILL INFERNAL?!

403
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,430
Luffy! Look at!

404
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,910
The sparrow!

405
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,630
It is him which balances us swarms!

406
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,230
Eh?!

407
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,190
T-T' ace included/understood what he said?!

408
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,290
“I would kill whoever will break
the calm one of the forest! “

409
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,930
He, frèrot, frèrot,
does not cause us!

410
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,920
You unload in the middle of the night, and
you hope that our gold will be yielded to you?

411
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,790
You bar!

412
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,440
There is bread on the board.

413
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,910
You are bodyguards?

414
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,980
Ah yes, this crowned pirate… Cricket.

415
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,440
I had wind of the tragedy
history of Montblanc to the tavern.

416
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,730
I had the tears with the eyes of it.

417
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,200
I find the fruits
labor of the others…

418
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,520
… particularly with my taste.

419
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,330
You know how one calls me?

420
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,740
The Hyena!

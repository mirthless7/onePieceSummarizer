1
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,385
<i>(The following episode is based
on Manga ch.5: "The Pirate King")</i>

2
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:55,585
<i>(...and "the Master Swordsman", ch.6:
"Number One" and ch.7: "Friends".)</i>

3
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,126
Fire!

4
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:20,804
Luffy-san!

5
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,436
The one with the straw hat!

6
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,946
They're useless!

7
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:38,694
Told you I was very strong!

8
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:41,430
Who the hell are you?

9
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,899
I am Luffy...

10
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,098
...a man who become the Pirates king!

11
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:50,739
"Morgan vs. Luffy!
Who's This Beautiful Young Girl?"

12
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,473
"Morgan VS Luffy!
Nazo no Bishoujo wa Dare?"

13
00:02:56,214 --> 00:03:00,283
What? You want to be a Pirate King?

14
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,820
Hey, do you know what it
means to be a pirate king?

15
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,389
A pirate king is a pirate king.

16
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,315
What else is it?

17
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:13,696
I was frightened when I heard that.

18
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:15,564
But Luffy is serious.

19
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:16,999
That is him.

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,736
He said he wants to be a pirate
king, and find the world's treasures.

21
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,334
That means he has to
get the "One Piece."

22
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,269
Take it it's your baby.

23
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,642
Which one? I don't know,
so I brought them all.

24
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:37,447
They're all mine I
am a three-swordsman.

25
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:40,423
If you cooperate with me,

26
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:44,716
you will become the evil
party against the government.

27
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:48,117
So, are you game?

28
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,667
Are you getting yourself killed?
You are the son of the devil.

29
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:54,603
Forget it, it can't be worse.

30
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:57,201
I promise... I'll be a pirate!

31
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,759
Wonderful! So you will be my partner!

32
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,113
Alright! Fantastic!

33
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:06,483
I haven't any choice! Now untie me!

34
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:08,918
That guy... it's so magic.

35
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,480
He lets the bullets bounce back!

36
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,789
That straw-hat man is
not an ordinary person!

37
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,043
He must have eaten the "Devil Fruit".

38
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,036
"Devil Fruit?"

39
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:19,954
He ate the treasure of the ocean?

40
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,060
Devil Fruit.

41
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:28,898
<i>If you ate it, you will have the
greatest power beyond imagination.</i>

42
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,442
<i>Like the ability to spit fire...</i>

43
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:34,935
<i>...or the power to
cause the tidal waves.</i>

44
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:36,479
<i>I have heard many legends,</i>

45
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,782
<i>but they are so many,
it's hard to comprehend.</i>

46
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:44,786
<i>I heard this treasure is sunken on
the ocean floor of the "Grand Line".</i>

47
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,590
The power of that straw-hat
man must be from the devil.

48
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,929
Quick, hurry up!

49
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,731
These knots are too tight!

50
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,066
Hey, stop whining.

51
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,734
No matter who he is,

52
00:04:57,735 --> 00:05:00,337
I will kill anyone who is against me!

53
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:04,230
If the bullets can't
do, kill him with swords!

54
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:09,679
Strange, it's getting tighter.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,116
Give me the swords!

56
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:16,783
Luffy-san!

57
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:26,696
Roronoa Zoro!

58
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:29,998
Oh, cool!

59
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,309
Don't move or you'll die.

60
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,531
He's so scary!

61
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:42,544
I promise I will be a pirate.

62
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,149
I've fought the navy;
therefore, I am now an outlaw.

63
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,752
But remember this

64
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:51,354
I have to carry out my ambition.

65
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:52,622
Ambition?

66
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:56,049
I want to become the best
swordsman in the world.

67
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:59,162
If you deter me from
achieving this dream,

68
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:03,466
I will make you commit Hara-Kiri!

69
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:07,070
The best swordsman, cool!

70
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:11,074
The pirate king's partner
must have this title.

71
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,776
You are so arrogant.

72
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:18,581
From now, I will be famous
even if it means notorious.

73
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:20,750
What are you doing here?

74
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,936
Kill them now!

75
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:26,014
Crouch down, Zoro.

76
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:29,326
GOMU GOMU NO!

77
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:31,996
WHIP!

78
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:36,266
You did it! Wonderful!

79
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,301
What is that?

80
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:41,004
Because I ate the rubber fruit.

81
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,006
Rubber fruit?

82
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,574
He is a rubber man.

83
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:47,043
He is the powerful man
who ate the "Devil Fruit."

84
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:49,446
Captain, they're too much for us!

85
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:50,947
That guy is too strong!

86
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:53,763
We can't even fight Zoro!

87
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,487
Captain's orders!

88
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:01,324
Those who do not fight
must kill themselves!

89
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,976
I don't need cowards!

90
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,367
This troop got some problems.

91
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:12,326
Luffy-san!

92
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:17,596
I will vanquish this navy.

93
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,550
You guys have no identity or title!

94
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:29,819
You are not qualified to fight with me!

95
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,790
I am Naval Captain Morgan!

96
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,093
I am Luffy, nice to meet you.

97
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,359
Go to hell!

98
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:50,106
Captain!

99
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:52,099
Kid!

100
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,279
Die!

101
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,477
I don't want to.

102
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,945
Captain Morgan...

103
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:06,680
We can never win.

104
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:12,095
What a crab navy. It
shatters Koby's dream.

105
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,163
Damn!

106
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:17,203
Stop, straw-hat man, look over here!

107
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:20,770
Stop it, you moron.

108
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:24,107
Don't you see I got a hostage?

109
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:25,742
Master Helmeppo!

110
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,009
Hey!

111
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,614
If you want him to live, don't move!

112
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:34,950
I'll shoot him if you move!

113
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:46,296
Luffy-san, don't let him win!

114
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:47,831
I am easy with death.

115
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,927
Yes, I know that.

116
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,801
Give up, stupid son.

117
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:54,595
Koby is ready.

118
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:58,541
Don't move! I told you not to move!

119
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,239
I am going to shoot!

120
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:01,945
Behind you!

121
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,346
GOMU GOMU NO!

122
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:08,810
I am the Naval Captain Morgan!

123
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:10,687
Papa, kill that boy.

124
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:14,023
Pistol!

125
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,394
Fantastic.

126
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:28,404
Zoro.

127
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:31,535
No big deal Captain!

128
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,717
Captain Morgan is knocked down!

129
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:43,143
I can't believe it!

130
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:48,986
Who dare to catch us,
declare your name first.

131
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:56,165
Wonderful, wonderful!

132
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,869
Freedom... Viva la Navy!

133
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,773
What is going on? The Captain is
defeated and they seem to be happy.

134
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:08,076
Actually they are afraid of Morgan.

135
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:14,717
Zoro, what's wrong? Are you hurt?

136
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:17,516
I am starving.

137
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:27,029
Sorry, please stand still.

138
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:44,442
It is not here.

139
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:03,900
I found it! The map of "Grand Line"!

140
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:07,065
It is here.

141
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:08,972
<i>"I have the map. Captain Buggy"</i>

142
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:12,399
It is not a sail map. What is this sign?

143
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:15,854
Captain Buggy!

144
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:20,603
<i>Buggy is called "the immortal body".</i>

145
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:50,670
Ah, I am so full.

146
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:55,148
I think this is my limit. I
haven't eaten for three weeks.

147
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:01,786
You can't eat no more?

148
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,156
Why did you eat more than me?

149
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,397
It's too delicious, isn't it, Koby?

150
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:10,800
I am sorry, I ate some too.

151
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,937
It's OK, you saved this town.

152
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:17,372
Old brother is really something.

153
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:19,341
Of course.

154
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:23,579
I can be even better, because
I will be the pirate king.

155
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,481
And I got my partner now!

156
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:30,012
Tell me, who else did
you find besides me?

157
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,656
Didn't you say you are
looking for partners?

158
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:39,328
Since you are the pirate king,
you must have a lot of followers.

159
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:41,128
No, you are the only one.

160
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:42,631
You mean...?

161
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes, just the two of us.

162
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,469
You call you and me are the pirate team?

163
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,938
What's wrong with it? We are both good.

164
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,774
And the Ship? Where is the pirate ship?

165
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,642
That one!

166
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,084
That one?

167
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:06,114
We will have a ship
bigger than that one!

168
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,057
How could it be possible?

169
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,154
I want a pirate flag!

170
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:21,837
Mm, it is cool!

171
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:26,675
Maybe Luffy isn't such a good planner.

172
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:30,045
And I called this man "captain"?

173
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,248
We will find more
partners sooner or later.

174
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:34,349
Hey you!

175
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,553
Big brother, what are you going to next?

176
00:13:37,554 --> 00:13:41,890
Believe it or not, we are
going to the "Grand Line"!

177
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,526
But you have only two people!

178
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,562
It is impossible! Even if you are god!

179
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:48,963
Impossible! Impossible!

180
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:51,527
Is the "Grand Line"
such a terrible place?

181
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,035
Of course it is terrible.

182
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:57,472
You should know that there are
two big oceans in the world.

183
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:02,110
<i>The land that divides the two
oceans is the giant "Red Line".</i>

184
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,314
<i>There is a town on the Red Line.</i>

185
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:09,885
<i>Go through that town, and sail around
the land in a vertical direction.</i>

186
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:13,288
<i>You will find the greatest
route, the "Grand Line."</i>

187
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:19,394
<i>It is said that the pirate king
"Gold Roger" had all the treasures.</i>

188
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:23,432
<i>He put the priceless
treasures on the "Grand Line".</i>

189
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:26,268
<i>It is the called the "One Piece."</i>

190
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:30,005
<i>So all the pirates wish
to go to the "Grand Line."</i>

191
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:36,970
<i>Now it is a terrible battle field. People
even called it "The Pirates'Graveyard".</i>

192
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,684
I have heard some deaths mentioned.

193
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:47,255
Once you enter the "Grand Line",
you will never leave alive.

194
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:50,926
But "One Piece" is on the "Grand Line"!

195
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:52,527
We have to be there!

196
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,262
Then I can't help you.

197
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,931
Zoro, even you would say so!

198
00:14:55,932 --> 00:14:58,266
You are not going anyway.

199
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:01,336
I'm not going, but I get worried, too!

200
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:03,105
Can we not go?

201
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:06,241
Though Luffy and I don't
know each other very long,

202
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,943
we are friends after all.

203
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:09,311
Aren't we?

204
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,747
We're going our separate ways,

205
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:14,639
but we'll always be friends!

206
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:20,589
I didn't have many
friends since childhood.

207
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,559
Nobody would fight for me.

208
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,226
Because I don't have
any strength myself.

209
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:35,604
But you two let me know that
I have to live by my faith.

210
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:39,074
I finally have the courage
to realize my childhood dream.

211
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,076
I will join the navy!

212
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:44,746
You were worrying about us just
now. Are you OK with you future?

213
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:45,981
What?

214
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:47,916
I was only a cabin boy on the ship.

215
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:52,413
You have stayed on the ship
for two years, that's true.

216
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:56,091
Don't give the navy
too much information.

217
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:59,494
If they know your past,
they won't let you in.

218
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,455
You are right...

219
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:04,497
Excuse me.

220
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:12,507
I heard that you are
pirates. Is that true?

221
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:17,779
Yes, I found a partner.
We are now a pirate team.

222
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,783
You saved our base and the
whole town from tyranny.

223
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:23,018
We all appreciate it.

224
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:25,921
But you are pirates.

225
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:29,758
For the reputation of
navy, you can't stay.

226
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,162
Please leave town.

227
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:37,999
For being just and moral, we
won't report this to the base.

228
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,802
Navy, what rubbish is that?

229
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:44,740
<i>Aren't you afraid to be subjected
to the tyranny of Morgan?</i>

230
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:47,909
<i>Those people saved our lives!</i>

231
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,465
<i>That's right!</i>

232
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,683
Ok, let's go.

233
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:56,985
Thank you, ma'am.

234
00:16:56,986 --> 00:16:59,554
Big brother, are you leaving?

235
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:01,513
Yes.

236
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,031
Aren't you their partner?

237
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:13,890
What? I..I am...

238
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:21,276
Wait, what's the matter with you?

239
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:25,347
I know this guy did some bad things.

240
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:27,616
<i>Luffy, you are not...</i>

241
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:30,719
There was a really fat woman pirate,

242
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,821
Her name is Alvida, I guess.

243
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:34,890
Luffy-san!

244
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:37,092
<i>If they find out that I've
been on the pirate ship,</i>

245
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:40,028
<i>they won't let me join the navy.</i>

246
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:45,300
The woman pirate always carries an
iron mace and she is old and ugly!

247
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:49,304
That guy has worked for the
woman pirate for two years.

248
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:52,507
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

249
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,603
<i>Luffy-san!</i>

250
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:05,287
Hear me, you stinky boy.

251
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:08,623
Damn! Damn! Damn!

252
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:11,726
Stop!

253
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:15,597
You can't mess around in this town!

254
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:20,025
Hey, you are too serious! Stop it now!

255
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,976
Now I know you are not on the same side.

256
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:31,003
Please leave now!

257
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,443
Hmm...

258
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:39,577
<i>He did it on purpose...</i>

259
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:43,350
<i>He did it purpose!</i>

260
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:48,663
<i>He did it for me!</i>

261
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:53,000
He gets me angry, and have me beat him.

262
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:59,469
<i>I counted on his help, even at last!</i>

263
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:06,411
<i>I haven't changed at all.</i>

264
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:10,051
<i>I am a idiot...</i>

265
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:12,079
Please let me...

266
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:15,290
Please let me... join the navy.

267
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,493
Even if I'll only be a cabin
boy, I will be glad to serve.

268
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:22,057
As long as I can be in the navy.

269
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:27,369
Objection, Captain!

270
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,105
I can't trust this guy.

271
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:33,708
We had pirates spy in the navy before.

272
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,711
We have to investigate you first.

273
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:41,071
I am determined to be in the navy.

274
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:53,295
Many of my friends
were killed by pirates.

275
00:19:53,296 --> 00:19:56,398
Don't look down on the navy.

276
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,265
Then...

277
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,362
You are in.

278
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,400
Yes!

279
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,686
"I have the map. Captain Buggy"

280
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,152
You are too crazy!

281
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,321
It won't be strange
if we were discovered.

282
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:23,124
Koby will think of his own way.

283
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,759
Our sail has a nice start.

284
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,324
We can't look back, this
is the style of pirates.

285
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,566
You are right.

286
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,798
Luffy-san!

287
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:36,404
Thank you!

288
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:39,708
I will never forget your help!

289
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:44,443
I never heard a navy
would salute a pirate.

290
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:49,517
Goodbye, Koby!

291
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:50,418
Luffy-san.

292
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,787
Goodbye, big brother!

293
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:56,157
Sa-lute!

294
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,063
Goodbye!

295
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:05,297
I have made a good friend.

296
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,565
Yes.

297
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:16,311
We just saluted to the pirates.
We have broken the navy law.

298
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,381
All the soldiers are not allowed
to eat dinner for three days.

299
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:20,382
Did you hear me?

300
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:22,580
Yes!

301
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,187
<i>One day...</i>

302
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,691
<i>One day we will reunite, Luffy.</i>

303
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:33,728
<i>Even though we will be pirate and navy.</i>

304
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:37,826
One day we will reunite!

305
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,240
The pirate ship is going to set out.

306
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,166
There seem to be a great
adventure waiting for us.

307
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:55,147
I am determined to be the pirate king.

308
00:21:56,952 --> 00:22:02,690
Do you have any reason for the
determination of being a pirate king?

309
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:04,692
No, no reason.

310
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:07,862
Just that I have vowed before.

311
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:10,322
I vowed to someone.

312
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,333
I will find the greatest partners,

313
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:14,369
<i>and find the most treasures,</i>

314
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,398
<i>to be a pirate king.</i>

315
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:25,440
This straw-hat knows it all.

316
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,117
Really?

317
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,461
Ok, let's go!

318
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:44,663
We are sailing to the "Grand Line"!

1
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
God alone knows it.

2
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,959
Trying to escape from Upper Yard,

3
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,460
Nami and its team move towards
east coast when Eneru makes its appearance.

4
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,780
It roasts Sanji and Usopp,
before disappearing.

5
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,590
I am called Hotori!

6
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,980
I am called Kotori!

7
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,060
On its territory, the brothers triplets of Satori, Hotori and Kotori, unload in search of revenge.

8
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,310
Sometimes, it is me
who must protect them!

9
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,260
During this time, four others
southern full leader towards the ancient city…

10
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,110
are separate after their
confrontation with a giant python.

11
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,810
Their ancestors had to set it up
after the city did not fall.

12
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,880
Shandora.

13
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,980
It was the name of the ancient city.

14
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,500
Who is there?

15
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,920
Where am I?

16
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,270
I did not have anything against you.

17
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,610
I will accept the challenge:Survival.

18
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,290
What a negligence!

19
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,639
This guy is stupid or what?!

20
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,100
Each one meets an adversary and
engage in an inescapable combat.

21
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,210
During the last confrontation,
Chopper puts the Gedatsu Priest at the carpet!

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,109
KOKUTEI
[The Cross of the Sharp Shoes]

23
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,710
CROSS-COUNTRY RACE!
[The Cross of the Sharp Shoes]

24
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:41,570
Invincible capacity!
The true nature of Eneru appears

25
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,389
Is all well, Kamakiri?

26
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,959
Do not make any you for me.

27
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,130
Look at rather around you.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,880
Look at!

29
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,689
Over there, in the clouds!

30
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,850
I see Giant Jack!

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,100
The ruins of Shandora are close!

32
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,040
And Eneru is at the top.

33
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,070
What do I can for you?

34
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,280
I am just there.

35
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,200
What did you want?

36
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,190
Kamakiri, Warrior of Shandora.

37
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,190
Eneru, species of dumb!

38
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,980
With which believe you to be addressed?

39
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,630
I am God.

40
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,840
You would like to know well
why I am descended.

41
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,780
Mantra?

42
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,210
I do not need me in
to be useful! Ca is read on your face.

43
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,679
But, I do not want you.

44
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,689
In theory, I do not see
interest to face you.

45
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,650
But this time, I
take part in the play of Survival.

46
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,369
And I will leave soon these grounds.

47
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,880
I have just made
my good-byes with Gan Fall.

48
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,819
You call that a play?

49
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,390
What a connery!

50
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,680
You seem impatient to kill me.

51
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,610
Very well.

52
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,789
As you are a warrior,

53
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,790
I will reward you to have surmounted
obstacles to arrive until me.

54
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,340
An outline of the leniency of God.

55
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,869
Let us see seeing…

56
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,579
What would you say five minutes?

57
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,120
During five minutes, I
will not move of an inch.

58
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,609
What?!

59
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,730
I will not dodge your
attacks, and I will not counteract.

60
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,690
Make me pass to
pan. I am at your mercy.

61
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,299
Dumb!

62
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,990
But once these five minutes spent,

63
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,260
You will become aware by
yourself of the existence of God.

64
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,520
DUMB!

65
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,730
BURST, ENERU!

66
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,510
Moron!

67
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,840
You cannot reach us!

68
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,780
Stop!!

69
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,560
STOP IMMEDIATELY!!

70
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,829
One will not stop!

71
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,460
One will not stop!

72
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,269
I AI KNOWN AS STOP!

73
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,149
They are unconscious!

74
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,459
And then?

75
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,839
And then?

76
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,389
It is them which wounded
our brother, Satori!

77
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,569
Wounded our brother!

78
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,140
And now, they will pay!

79
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,550
Brothel!

80
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,140
Thank you for the impact!

81
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,310
An Impact?!

82
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,570
Beurk! It is what this odor?!

83
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,199
I see.

84
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,710
They use four
kinds different of Dials.

85
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,279
It is exact!

86
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,489
Impact!

87
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,719
Flavor!

88
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,140
You memorized?

89
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,639
You will not be able to follow!

90
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,989
Now, which is
Hotori, and which is Kotori?

91
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,219
That there is in
each hand?

92
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,369
It is so funny to imagine
what you will receive!

93
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,610
SURPRISED DIAL ILLUSION!

94
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,269
I know the various kinds
now. Let us not waste time.

95
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,960
I type myself of it knowledge which is which!

96
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,040
A typhoon approaches!

97
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,170
Failure!

98
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,360
Failure!

99
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,060
And now, which Dial
is in my right hand?

100
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,279
It was still my fart!

101
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,109
Imbecile!

102
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,979
You expected to see
to leave fire, not true?

103
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,350
Fire is in my right hand!

104
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,260
The gas will take fire!

105
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,030
Odd knight!

106
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,759
This imbecile!

107
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,540
He flew away!

108
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,040
Which stupid turn of kid.

109
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,010
You underestimated me.

110
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,220
Kotori!

111
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,230
Return…

112
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,340
Cyclone Tempo!

113
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,099
He! Young girl.

114
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,490
Find my glove in bottom
on the bridge and it completes.

115
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,959
Odd knight, your
was wound reopened?

116
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,140
Do not occupy you of me!
It soon will return!

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,899
A glove?

118
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,830
A glove, a glove…

119
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,529
A glove?

120
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,490
Is He, it what a glove?

121
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,409
Ouah, it is heavy!

122
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,119
It is made of iron
coming from the Blue Sea.

123
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,279
A Dial Impact was
embedded inside.

124
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,260
Use it as I have you
shown presently.

125
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,130
I included/understood how it goes, but
this trick is too heavy for me!

126
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,010
YOU WILL PAY IT!

127
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,589
I believe that I
will not have the choice.

128
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,550
Initially, my Satori big brother, and
now, my Kotori little brother!

129
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,690
Even your prayers you
will not save now!

130
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,099
It is him which makes use of fire.

131
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,010
Its body is soaked and
the air is in charge of moisture…

132
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,530
Mailbox

133
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,679
It is what?

134
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,959
It is more and more
cold… It is all?

135
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,159
Yes, completely!

136
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,009
You of fire, isn't this makes use?

137
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,239
You insane of me?!

138
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,860
Ca will not be enough with
to counter my Dial Flame!

139
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,680
I will reduce to you in ashes!

140
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,190
Hot air in contact with the cold air
will create a condensation of moisture…

141
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,660
A fog will be formed!

142
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,589
FOG

143
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,220
TEMPO

144
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,240
It is what that?!

145
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,279
Y' has fog everywhere!

146
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,649
I do not see anything!

147
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,530
What you make?!

148
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,499
What?! What you make?!

149
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,040
All my excuses.

150
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,600
IMPACT

151
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,579
AÏÏÏÏE!

152
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,789
I failed to tear off me the arm!

153
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,150
Why you made
that, odd Knight?!

154
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,619
Hold out.

155
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,240
You were superb, my expensive.

156
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,129
But, good!

157
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,160
I protected the boat and the crew!

158
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,790
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

159
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,380
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

160
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,280
Must I call you
Aisa-san?

161
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,060
You know really which road have
taken pirates of the Blue Sea?

162
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,089
Yes.

163
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,239
Which astonishing gift.

164
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,770
In spite of the distance, you can
to hear their voice since the forest.

165
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,719
But first of all, you feel well?

166
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,130
You did not stop trembling
since we collected you.

167
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,179
It is…

168
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,959
What?

169
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,780
It is because I never have
be also afraid of all my life.

170
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,909
All voices…

171
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,230
All the voices which disappear…

172
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,929
Yes, I am sorry.

173
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,949
We must hurry, Conis-san.

174
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,550
Yes, Father.

175
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,169
He! Where you go,
Odd knight?!

176
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,719
Afflicted, but I must find Eneru and…

177
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,869
What you say?!

178
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,449
You will leave one
all alone woman?!

179
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,839
I already did you my excuses.

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,120
I must know why
Eneru came in the forest.

181
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,540
It is perhaps…

182
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,590
Perhaps…?

183
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,280
When Eneru appeared, 650 Soldiers
under my command were captured.

184
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,710
I do not have time to explain you,
but my men are in danger.

185
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,340
Not, it is the country all
entirety which is in danger.

186
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,150
Can you fly, Pierre?

187
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,440
Wait!

188
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,519
I leave you the glove and
the impact which is inside.

189
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,289
You should be able
to clear up you.

190
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,800
What?

191
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,579
RETURN IMMEDIATELY!

192
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,959
SPECIES OF MONSTER WITHOUT HEART!

193
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,479
AND YOU ARE CAUGHT FOR GOD?!

194
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,749
RETURN HERE!

195
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,230
REFLECT A LITTLE!

196
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,890
I WILL CRY!

197
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,349
For the moment, I must give
first aid with these deux-là.

198
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,590
You are alive the guy, not true?

199
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,360
Chopper, hurries to return…

200
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,810
C-C-C' was
what?!

201
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,270
Nami-san! Heso!

202
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,140
Conis?

203
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,929
Heso.

204
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,340
And his/her father?

205
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,580
What you made here?

206
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,110
And you cannot
to stop this trumpet?!

207
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,119
Let leave to me!

208
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,509
Not! You must remain there!

209
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,219
Let leave to me!

210
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,199
If you venture all there
only, you will be made kill!

211
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,659
We promised
not to remain a long time!

212
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,619
Let leave to me!

213
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,069
Who is this child?

214
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,399
Ah, it is called Aisa and…

215
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,089
Does not approach you, unpleasant
girl of the Blue Sea!

216
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,449
I go you écrabouiller!

217
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,319
I am warlike of Shandora!

218
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,409
Ouais? And then?

219
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,509
You want to fight?

220
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,729
I will give you an Impact to be chewed.

221
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,269
Oh not, they are carbonized!

222
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,519
They should be looked after immediately!

223
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,869
At all events, forgive me…

224
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,630
Please, could you direct
your boat towards our way?

225
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,550
We used Milky Dial
to create this new river.

226
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,990
While following it, you will arrive
directly with the Sea of Opal…

227
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,630
before the enemy does not find us.

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,829
You could not be one
little more discrete then?

229
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,740
Ah, yes, there is something
that I wanted to give you.

230
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,080
To give me?

231
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,629
Waver!

232
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,090
I repaired Waver that you
had brought back Blue Sea.

233
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,170
Now, take it, I
you requests some. It is with you.

234
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,829
Ouah! Really?!

235
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,459
Yes.

236
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,809
Brilliant!

237
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,000
However, this Waver
is a little particular.

238
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,080
Its power is
higher than the normal.

239
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,220
I am sorry.

240
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,729
Oh.

241
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,210
Be to you still there?

242
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,100
Afflicted.

243
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,429
I had calmed down.

244
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,739
That there
does it have?

245
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,900
You seem to suffer, Kamakiri-kun.

246
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,040
As promised, I did not do anything.

247
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,990
I…

248
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,620
donot can you
v-to overcome, isn't?

249
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,150
Yes, it is right.

250
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,879
You included/understood, now.

251
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,320
I am the lightning.

252
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,860
No matter what they make, men
nothing against the lightning will never be able.

253
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,520
Having always lived in the sky, you
ace inevitably already considering a flash by far.

254
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,440
Since old times, the men have
allocated with God the mysteries of nature.

255
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,190
As all that they could not
to include/understand and which frightened them.

256
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,680
All that humanity underwent
was allotted to the will of God.

257
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:55,160
The men accepted their impotence
vis-a-vis the natural disasters.

258
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,359
And I am myself one.

259
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,350
I am regarded as
God. You include/understand?

260
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,819
Oh.

261
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,260
[Note:Breath = breath]

262
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
burn blade!

263
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,999
I must inform Wiper!

264
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,270
We cannot
to gain this battle!

265
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,520
It is suicide!

266
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,160
Even if it is sacrificed, it
Reject will not have any effect!

267
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,390
It is a little late to flee.

268
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,879
We must revalue the danger!

269
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,169
If not…

270
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,700
If not!

271
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,350
You believe capacity to move
more quickly than the lightning?

272
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,740
Your five minutes are past.

273
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,040
It is my turn.

274
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,560
1.000.000 Vari volt

275
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,770
FLEE, WIPER!!

276
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,380
It was what?

277
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,849
NOT!!

278
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,309
What? What?!

279
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,599
What did it occur?

280
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,839
What is there?

281
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,379
Voices…

282
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,820
The voices disappeared…

283
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,239
Thin then.

284
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,030
My electricity seems to be
propagated in Milky Road.

285
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,390
20 other voices disappeared
after the electric shock.

286
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,010
The poor imbeciles.

287
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,519
On Upper Yard,

288
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,640
81 people started
play of Survival.

289
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:52,770
Two hours are
run out and 56 fell.

290
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,850
There remains 13 of my holy guard about it…

291
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,820
5 of the crew of Straw hat…

292
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,750
and 7 in the Shandia rows.

293
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,090
What wants to say that they
are nothing any more but 25.

294
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,980
It is more than I had envisaged.

295
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,979
It does not matter.

296
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,780
I must pay attention
with the figures.

297
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,340
Who will join me finally?

298
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,909
This collar is out of gold!

299
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,090
The Gold City is perhaps
in this cave!

300
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,520
I hope to find some yakiniku…
[Yakiniku = Flat meat Japanese]

301
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,710
Good go!

302
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,760
Where I am?!

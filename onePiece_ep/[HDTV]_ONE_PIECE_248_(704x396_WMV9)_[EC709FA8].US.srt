1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,350
Mozu!

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,650
Kiwi!

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,950
Forgive my intrusion.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,349
These two women did not let to us enter.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,550
What do you foutez there, you?

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,850
TEKKAI!

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,150
What you want, hein?!

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,450
Does Blueno, what that want to say?

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,850
What do you intend to make?

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,950
Small impertinent! For which you take to me?!

11
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,950
You know with whom you rub?

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,250
Usually, with the bar, you are not so sharp!

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,249
It is what this getup?!

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,450
You acted not as usual, hein? He!

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,750
Stop, Blueno.

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,750
Does Oi, that go?

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,349
Seized again!

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,849
How it is made if you kill it now?

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,250
Do not forget our mission.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,349
Afflicted.

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,850
Q - What it occurs?! Oi!

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,149
They is not the guys of the building site?!

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,950
What? It is him which has just struck me?

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,649
For what a reason?! You behave as if you had super-capacities!

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:40,350
Good-for-nothings, how dare you to attack my unmarried poor small?!

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,950
But initially, how did you find this place? It is my secret base!

27
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,949
It does not matter.

28
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,350
Let us make simple…

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,450
Listen well. To live here was only one cover for us.

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,050
Our true identitée is agent secret world government.

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,150
You must certainly know what that wants to say…

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,250
And why we are there.

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,450
Franky, we know already all.

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,350
Cutty Flam…

35
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,650
The other disciple of Tom, that died since eight years…

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,750
It is you.

37
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,150
I do not know how you are with the current, but cheer.

38
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,950
At the same time, I suspected it oddly.

39
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,749
And is this imbecile of Iceberg, it well?

40
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,950
We killed it.

41
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:40,490
Past of Franky!
The day of the first departure of Umi Ressha

42
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,550
Do not play the innocent one with us.

43
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,450
We know already all.

44
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,350
It is only one matter of time before making me locate.

45
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,749
Take-that with you and leaves this island, Franky.

46
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,849
Of Tom with Iceberg, Iceberg to you…

47
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,650
They were transmitted.

48
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,250
You two, come-there! I have something of important to say to you.

49
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,149
Our long mission touches finally at its end.

50
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,150
Now, sketches of the Ancestral Weapon, Pluto…

51
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,150
Give them to us, Cutty Flam.

52
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,050
Flam?

53
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,750
Which funny of name.

54
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,150
Is Franky, it better, of agreement?

55
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,650
It does not matter.

56
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,650
You hear me?

57
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,250
I said to you to give it to us, Cutty Flam!

58
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,350
I do not have anything to give, puffiness!

59
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,150
What did it occur?

60
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,650
It was too fast, I do not have anything considering.

61
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,950
Are Oi, you well?

62
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,050
What is this thus?

63
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,350
What is it, Lucci?

64
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,550
Which is this feeling reluctant part?

65
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,550
A workshop of drawing?

66
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,750
The perfect place for hiding sketches.

67
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,750
Find them.

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,350
It is what?

69
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,650
Personal plates.

70
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,950
Cutty Flam.

71
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,549
Iceberg.

72
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,850
Tom.

73
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,050
These names are…

74
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,650
And that?

75
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,950
Do not touch!

76
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,649
Do not touch with our memories with your dirty hands!

77
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,349
It is there that we grew.

78
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:58,750
It is there that lived Tom' S Workers, the largest carpenters of the world!

79
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,440
Toilets 7,22 years earlier.

80
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,749
IT WILL PUFF OUT ME!

81
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,750
PRENDS-that!

82
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,450
Release from there, Iceberg!

83
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,150
Maaa! What you insane, Franky?!

84
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,150
Cretin!

85
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,849
Maaa! What you factories instead of me to help?!

86
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,150
Always making dangerous tricks!

87
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,650
The farm, that do not look at yourself Bakaburg!

88
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,449
It is my invaluable boat of combat “Battle Franky”!

89
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,550
Anything, destroy to me that before wounding somebody!

90
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,649
Deal with your business!

91
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,249
This island is a discharge!

92
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,149
You will see! The next time, my boat of combat will be able to overcome a monstre marin!

93
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,849
Maaa, in your dreams! To make you devour rather!

94
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,649
I can overcome it!

95
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,649
Maaa, you cannot!

96
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,349
I can!

97
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,050
Maaa, you cannot!

98
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,950
If you are a man…

99
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,050
Do it with a “GIFT”!

100
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,150
Ceremony of launching finished.

101
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,150
This robust boat was built the time of a “GIFT”!

102
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,950
Not true, Yokozuna?

103
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,550
We will make the completions tomorrow. Go, one returns.

104
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,750
Ahh, I am hungry.

105
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,250
I wonder what one eats this evening.

106
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,950
He, await us, Tom-san!

107
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,650
Is Franky, which the number of the last Battle Franky?

108
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,649
Number 8. It is almost finished.

109
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,549
Do not pack you, cretin. It is because Tom-san helped you that it is so well!

110
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,349
You made only artillery!

111
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,149
Close it, Bakaburg!

112
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,350
What arrives to you, BAKANKY?!

113
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,749
Yes, yes. Stop to you chamailler, both.

114
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,050
But Kokoro-san, it…

115
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,550
Cretin…

116
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,150
Tom-san, you laugh too extremely. What is there of so funny?

117
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,750
Ouais, another merchant ship charged with wood was done plundered by the pirates.

118
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,550
Since the execution of the Lord of the pirates, the pirates multiplied.

119
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,450
This city is foutue. It will not resist this era of piracy.

120
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,450
We are submerged concern.

121
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,850
Because of Aqua Laguna…

122
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,950
We are obliged to make import the wood and the iron of the other islands.

123
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,950
The trade is blocked by the sea and the pirates.

124
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,250
The building sites which miss customers beat between them.

125
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,849
Brawls burst.

126
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,150
Manpower decrease.

127
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,450
If nothing is done, Water 7 will become obsolete, subjected to the floods.

128
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,150
The same Toilets 7 which were transformed into legend with the passing of years.

129
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,450
It is true. And then, Tom-san did one terrifying boat of pirate.

130
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,050
He, show me the sketches of boat pirate!

131
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,850
Why do you laugh?

132
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,150
Franky, of the preset sketches of pirate boats, that does not exist.

133
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,249
If the sailors hoist a flag of pirate, then it is a pirate boat.

134
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,150
If they hoist a seagull, it is a boat of the navy.

135
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,450
It does not matter how you reach that point…

136
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,150
A man must be to trust of his boat with a GIFT!

137
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,050
Won't Tom-san, you lay down you?

138
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,750
What do you draw?

139
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,450
Ah, it is the last hope of this island.

140
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,350
Hope?

141
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,450
With this…

142
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,750
I hope that with that, Water 7 will find its splendor.

143
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,150
Let us lie down now.

144
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,850
The boat of the governmental court arrives!

145
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,850
The court?

146
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,550
It is a mobile court. Who do they come to judge?

147
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,749
He, wait! What made Tom-san?

148
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,750
You push! You over there, slacken Tom-san!

149
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,950
All is well, does not worry you.

150
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,150
Tom-san! TOM-SAN!

151
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:37,750
The construction of Oro Jackson, the boat of the Lord of the pirates, recently the construction of Oro J

152
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,250
Like an important international crime.

153
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,450
Tom, the manufacturer of ship, will be led to Enies Lobby…

154
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,750
To be carried out there.

155
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,650
It is horrible! Tom will be carried out!

156
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,950
It is shown to have built the boat of the Lord of the pirates!

157
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,350
Then they finally came.

158
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,250
The whole world was persecuted by this pirate. It deserves it.

159
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:24,650
Usually, to sell a boat with anyone is not a crime, but for the Lord of the pirates, it is different.

160
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,349
Whoever having helped it in its acts…

161
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,350
Will be regarded as dangerous…

162
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,450
In other words, the capital punishment!

163
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,650
Take along the culprit.

164
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,450
Yes.

165
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,950
Allons-y.

166
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,150
Hurry!

167
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,049
What there is?! Hurry!

168
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,449
Oi, What you make?!

169
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,450
In this moment, I…

170
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,250
I develop the plans of a steam engine which will move on the sea with a GIFT.

171
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,149
He, you! What you tell?!

172
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,049
You…

173
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,850
I would wish to put a term at this bloquage commercial on the island.

174
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,150
Lately, population…

175
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,050
Is made concern for this island which is inserted in the sea.

176
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,150
The presence of Umi Ressha…

177
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,550
Will be without any doubt, of a great utility.

178
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,249
Excuse us. We will transferrons it immediately.

179
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,750
Not, wait.

180
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,650
Umi Ressha, do you say?

181
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,750
It is a steam train which will move on rails of island in island.

182
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,049
It will transport momentary, goods and boats, some is the weather.

183
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,450
Each one will be able to cross the sea freely.

184
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,350
He dreams?

185
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,249
The rails will be destroyed by Aqua Laguna.

186
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,949
Ouais, and the ocean is full with monstres marins!

187
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,250
The rails will not need to be repaired in the sea.

188
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,550
The waves will not have any effect because they will float at water surface.

189
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,450
Umi Ressha will have only to follow the rails to travel.

190
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:09,250
I also hope to create ultrasounds between the rails and the wheels in order to make flee fish.

191
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,350
Thus, the monstres marins will not approach.

192
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,550
It is possible, that?

193
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,550
St Poplar, Pucchi, San Faldo. If we connect these islands enter they…

194
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,150
They will be able to start again the trade and to make grow industry.

195
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,450
Marvellous!

196
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,850
The sketches are ready, but ordinary workmen do not have competences.

197
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,850
Could Enies Lobby be connected?

198
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,750
Well-sure that yes, obviously.

199
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,549
When this project is finished and that we will have exceeded the ocean…

200
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,650
The exchanges between the islands will change with GIFT.

201
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,550
Umi Ressha is the last hope of Toilets 7!

202
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,450
How long will that take?

203
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,849
Ten years.

204
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,649
Then with work.

205
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:01,850
The sentence of Tom, the manufacturer of boat, is suspended during ten years in order to build Umi Ressha!

206
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,949
Brilliant!

207
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,749
In you to play, Tom!

208
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,550
Save Water 7!

209
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,450
GIFT, and I am still in life!

210
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,350
It is not worthwhile to laugh at it, Tom-san.

211
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,850
I was petrified, believer that your hour had sounded!

212
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,550
With a little chance, if all occurs well, they will pass sponge for Roger.

213
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,849
Maaa! Tom-san, you are really brilliant…

214
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,849
When it comes you from the similar ideas!

215
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,650
All were amazed.

216
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,050
After all, I…

217
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,750
Thank you for the meal! Come, Yokozuna, I will teach you the crawl!

218
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,650
Oi, Franky, what it arrives to you?! You will not be annoyed for that!

219
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,950
Close it! All irritates me!

220
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,849
The boat of Gold Roger was the only one with being able to cross Grand Line!

221
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,550
Why Tom-san, who manufactured this splendid boat, should be carried out?!

222
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,249
Ca with the obvious air for everyone!

223
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,550
These imbeciles, even not able to build a raft!

224
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,950
I know it!

225
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,649
The reason for which our company is under a bridge…

226
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,850
Is how we were expelled of the city because of the boat of Roger!

227
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,850
Why the best naval engineer of the world should undergo that?!

228
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,649
What there is the funny one, little rat with horn?!

229
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,650
For which you are caught, Bakanky?! I do not allow myself!

230
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,850
I cannot support only itself of foute.

231
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,450
Not, not, not like that!

232
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,450
Strike more extremely with your legs!

233
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,350
NOT, NOT! Push more extremely in water, like that!

234
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,450
What does it arrive to him? It would be enough to transfer it, this cretin!

235
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,349
Let us go, do not say that. It is our companion, he builds boats with us.

236
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,650
Its competences in naval construction are quite higher than that of the craftsmen of the island.

237
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,150
Even if its constructions are a little dangerous.

238
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,450
He always goes from the front one.

239
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,549
Two years ago, I were surprised by this kid which had emerged…

240
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,150
Discharge with GIFT, and which was able to create a gun with refuses.

241
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,550
Ossan! Adopt me! My father gave up me!

242
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,949
I intended to say that his/her father had given up it because it was unbearable.

243
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,150
Surely a pirate of shoddy goods.

244
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,249
What a connery!

245
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,350
Tom-san.

246
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,350
Isn't strapping man?

247
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,450
Despite everything that, it resisted.

248
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,149
Both, you will become one day of famous manufacturers of ship!

249
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,950
You respect.

250
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,050
It is genetically impossible for Franky.

251
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,049
Now, when the sketches are finished, construisont Umi Ressha!

252
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,849
Ah.

253
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,550
Ca would astonish me that it helps us.

254
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,750
It does well what it wants.

255
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,150
A suicide?

256
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,250
It is the chief of the building site n°4. Because of the accident.

257
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,449
They do not have any more raw material, then they took the sea to buy themselves of them.

258
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,950
50 perished in the ocean.

259
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,550
The building site soon will close.

260
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,150
The human existance is fragile.

261
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,550
Is this island foutue?

262
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,350
Ooi! You heard the rumor which comes from the discharge?!

263
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,049
O-oi! It is true?

264
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,750
Tom' S Workers finished Umi Ressha?!

265
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,149
Whoa! A boat as that can really travel?

266
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,749
A criminal manufactured this boat. They is dangerous.

267
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,749
I will go up on board!

268
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,349
Then, I will go too!

269
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,250
Tom, no explanation?

270
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,550
Imminent departure, go up on board!

271
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,549
It moves!

272
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,850
The wheels turn on the rails!

273
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,850
Ten years an old history.

274
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,150
For the first time…

275
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,549
The doors of silvering had been closed…

276
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,250
In the obsolete city.

277
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,750
Heating the heart of people…

278
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,050
Umi Ressha, “Puffing Tom”, had exceeded the ocean.

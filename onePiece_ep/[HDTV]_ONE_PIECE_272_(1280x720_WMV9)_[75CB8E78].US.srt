1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,050
One Piece Treasure Present! The first keyword is... this!

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,270
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:22,320
Pursuing Luffy, the four Straw Hats and the Franky Family were approaching the Courthouse Plaza.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,820
We'll leave it to you, Gomorrah!

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,980
To the Courthouse!

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,270
Gomorrah!

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,490
Shit!

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,800
Who's that guy?

9
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,940
It won't go so easily!

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,020
Pieces of trash.

11
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,200
We did it! We beat the second one!

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,440
If we get encircled in such a place, they'll kill us!

13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,110
On the other side, Sogeking made a comeback at the Main Island Front Gate.

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,730
We did it!

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,270
Oimo and Kaashii are back on their feet!

16
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,790
How can this be?

17
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,800
I don't have enough stamina left to fight those guys...

18
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,220
Is this the end?

19
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,840
How could you...

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,020
Dare to...

21
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,330
CHEAT US!?

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,080
Before we celebrate the safety of our bosses!

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,840
Before we mourn the wasted time!

24
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,190
Until we're satisfied, we'll rampage everything to our anger's content!

25
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,490
Let's go together!

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,350
King of the Snipers!

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,560
Hand in hand with Oimo and Kaashii,

28
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,850
he's on Luffy and the others' tracks.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,980
There's nothing to fear.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,480
This time, we'll raise the signal of a counterattack!

31
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,030
Let's hurry to our comrades!

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,260
Tastes bad.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,200
You'll realize the extent of the changes very soon.

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,920
This is the birth of new Devil Fruit users.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,810
It's going to be fun.

36
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,240
Try to at least get a hold of your abilities while you can.

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,900
Meanwhile, Luffy was on the top of the Courthouse, as his intense fight with Blueno was starting to unfold.

38
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,400
There was a door in the floor just now!

39
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,460
W-What? What's this?

40
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,540
Were there such small doors here before!?

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,260
Damn!

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,480
I'm stuck, shit!

43
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,010
What's happening!?

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,840
My eyes are turning!!

45
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,680
W-W-Which way is the front!?

46
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Make it stop!

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,510
Oi, cook!

48
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,950
Yeah, I saw.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,510
Luffy is already fighting with the CP9.

50
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,650
There's only one way remaining!

51
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,300
Yeah...

52
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,330
We'll cut through them to the Courthouse!

53
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,340
We can't do otherwise.

54
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,070
Alright! Let's go, guys!

55
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,080
Wait!

56
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,210
Don't get off, everybody!

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,630
Chopper?

58
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,380
Hold on tight!

59
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,740
Gomorrah is...

60
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,780
Gomorrah is saying this!

61
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,600
GO, GOMORRAH!

62
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,900
Oi, Gomorrah!

63
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,690
Why are you banging your own body against the walls!?

64
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,040
Why!? So it really was overdoing it?

65
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,190
T-That's not it...

66
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,660
He's become blind!

67
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,600
His retina were damaged and he's lost his eyesight!

68
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,760
What? So your eyes can't see?

69
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,580
He started charging like crazy!

70
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,180
Don't just stand there!

71
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,900
Stop that gigantic monster!

72
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you doing!?

73
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,690
Hurry and shoot him down!

74
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,140
Stop, Gomorrah!

75
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,880
You can't go on with your body in this state!

76
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,910
He said that he made a promise, to Sodom.

77
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,850
'Leave the rest to me.'

78
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,090
'I'll do your share and carry everyone on my back!'

79
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,400
Gomorrah...

80
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,670
They were inside the stomach?

81
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,720
I can't eat anymore.

82
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,330
I'm completely stuffed.

83
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,040
Let's take them home as emergency food.

84
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,180
Aniki! This is bad!

85
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,260
Sodom and Gomorrah got beaten by pirates!

86
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,630
Don't you have a lot of guts, daring to touch my comrades!?

87
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,600
Oi! You're injured, so don't start dancing!

88
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,430
Sodom! Gomorrah!

89
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,600
It's a dead end ahead!

90
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,590
We'll crash into it and die!

91
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,120
Gomorrah, stop!

92
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,530
Don't rush in recklessly!

93
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,730
Stop!

94
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,690
A dead end?

95
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,370
Do you see such a thing?

96
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,300
No.

97
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,960
I can't spot one anywhere...

98
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,660
It's the Courthouse! Gomorrah!

99
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,010
We're there!

100
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,590
Gomorrah!

101
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,080
Message to all personnel!

102
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,360
The Kingbull ridden by the pirates has passed through the D-block,

103
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,210
and has now arrived at the Courthouse Plaza!

104
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,070
I repeat!

105
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,390
The pirates are...!

106
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,100
Look, Funk Freed.

107
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,420
A Golden Den-Den Mushi.

108
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,070
If you think about it, this Den-Den Mushi is just the same as holding the Buster Call's authority,

109
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,830
as it is unusable without the permission of at least a Headquarter's Admiral.

110
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,820
A valuable method that is forbidden to hold otherwise.

111
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,350
In order to launch the Buster Call,

112
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,030
Ao Kiji placed it under my care.

113
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,170
Look at how it is now!

114
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,600
If the revival of the weapons becomes a reality,

115
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,130
without even having to get it from an Admiral,

116
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,130
I will control this little thing all by myself.

117
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,120
I'll certainly become a man who'll command the troops at will.

118
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,800
The Buster Call.

119
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,150
We will now launch the Buster Call.

120
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,010
All ships may commence attack!

121
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,830
We will now turn all of this island, Ohara, into ash here and now!

122
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,990
With a single push of this button,

123
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,610
a whole island disappears...

124
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,350
Authority is the same as a weapon again.

125
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,660
Chief Spandam!

126
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,040
You surprised me!

127
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,880
What's your problem!?

128
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,340
Can't you knock!?

129
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,960
I almost pushed the button!

130
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,810
I-I'm really sorry.

131
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,450
But since this is an emergency...

132
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,390
This is a Den-Den Mushi from Enies Lobby's Main Island.

133
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,620
What!?

134
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,310
If it's a Den-Den Mushi, they could just directly call this room!

135
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,480
And... Oi!

136
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,650
Isn't that receiver off the hook!?

137
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,170
Who's doing that all the time?

138
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,270
You just said something about an emergency matter...

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:07,940
Yes!

140
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,080
Spanda...

141
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,200
Oi, Nico Robin.

142
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,110
It seems like there is an urgent report incoming from Enies Lobby's Main Island.

143
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,010
It's probably nothing too urgent, though...

144
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,970
You can anticipate a lot.

145
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,630
They tried their best and succeeded in beating five of our soldiers.

146
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,650
What became of Straw Hat Luffy?

147
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,610
In front of the best gatekeepers, Oimo and Kaashii,

148
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,340
I wonder in which horrible way your nakama were crushed...

149
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,440
Let's ask together about the fate of those idiots...

150
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,900
Those who opposed the World Government!

151
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,730
You're the worst kind of person!

152
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,100
Shut up, hoodlum!

153
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,420
Oi, soldier!

154
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah, this is Spandam.

155
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,980
Yes! Is this Chief-dono?

156
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,250
That's great...

157
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,460
I can finally report!

158
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,610
Wha... What should I begin with?

159
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
Calm down, fool!

160
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,250
It's about the Straw Hat crew, right?

161
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:26,950
What about them?

162
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,330
Ah, wait, wait.

163
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,170
Listen well.

164
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,970
Resume the information at the main point,
 and yell it out loud and clearly.

165
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,100
Yes!

166
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,090
Did you kill them all?

167
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,910
The intru-

168
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,160
Yeah, that's because the opponent was weak!

169
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,030
The intruders consist of about sixty pirates!

170
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,500
This is actually Enies Lobby's Main Island's worst ever situation!

171
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,540
They have invaded up to the Courthouse Plaza!

172
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,230
To all personnel on Enies Lobby's Main Island!

173
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,140
All hands! Get to the Courthouse Plaza at once!

174
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,710
Good job, Gomorrah!

175
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,040
We won't let the hard work of you two brothers...

176
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,540
...go to waste!

177
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,790
We're breaking in, guys!

178
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,360
We're going to save Franky aniki!

179
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,420
The pirates have arrived at the Courthouse Plaza!!

180
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,900
Can you see Luffy?

181
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,770
No...

182
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,240
If he's on that roof, there's no way we can climb up there for him.

183
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,260
We're not made of rubber too...

184
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,930
How many CP9 did you see up there?

185
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,730
We only saw the big guy with horns.

186
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,170
It's hard to believe that they would all be gathered there after bringing Robin-chan and Franky to such a place.

187
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,720
Anyway, we must hurry to catch up to Luffy...

188
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,630
We must hurry to save Robin.

189
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,670
Hurry!

190
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,000
To the front of the Courthouse!

191
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,230
The bridge hasn't been lowered yet!

192
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,130
Let's catch up!

193
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,870
Oh, that's awesome, frog!

194
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,900
That's the steel ball that defeated Gomorrah! What is that frog!?

195
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,040
Where are they? They're running away! There are three of them!

196
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,580
Why are they running away?

197
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,480
They attacked first...

198
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
Idiot! 

199
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,060
If we start following the enemies that are escaping all day long, it'll just be a waste of time!

200
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,970
Shut up, it's confirmation.

201
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,220
It's also good to know what kind of enemies will come at us.

202
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,110
What happened?

203
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,110
Awesome...

204
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,420
What is that guy?

205
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,140
He must have quite the superhuman strength to be able to swing that thing around!

206
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,250
Is this a special unit like the Houbantai?

207
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,690
He may still be hiding something.

208
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,320
Be careful.

209
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,930
Alright, let's hurry!

210
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,700
The other soldiers are coming this way.

211
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,020
We've gotta catch up!

212
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,210
At least they won't be able to open the Courthouse's heavy rock door!

213
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,710
Stop them at the Plaza!

214
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,570
Now that they say that...

215
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,930
How are we gonna...

216
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,340
...open that...

217
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,570
...huge door?

218
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,110
Don't fall behind, we'll be going in first!

219
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,770
He... He just cut through that thick stone!

220
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,440
Zanbai!

221
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,830
Us two will separate ourselves between the left and right tower!

222
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310
We're gonna pull that drawbridge's lever.

223
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,040
U-Understood.

224
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll leave that to you.

225
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,360
Alright, we'll divide ourselves into three teams.

226
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,150
The guys coming with me are gonna help clean the Courthouse's insides.

227
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,230
I only need a few of you.

228
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,830
Good luck in your fights!

229
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:53,850
Dismiss!

230
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Then there's the gatekeepers at the Main Island's Front Gate.

231
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,620
Oimo and Kaashii have joined with the pirates.

232
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,260
At the moment, they're destroying the middle part of the Main Island!

233
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,580
Open the way!

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,620
The damage report for our soldiers here is exceeding...

235
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,150
Two thousand men!

236
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,190
W-Wasn't it five people?

237
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,940
Meanwhile, their captain, Straw Hat Luffy, who took down a thousand of them by himself,

238
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,890
has suddenly disappeared!

239
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,500
Research is still being carried out!

240
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,170
This is probably...

241
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,020
the first time a situation as bad as this has occurred since Enies Lobby's history began!

242
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,550
Blueno...

243
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,170
What are you doing over there?

244
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,180
What's happening?

245
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,190
Now, on this island...

246
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,680
WHAT'S HAPPENING!?

247
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,780
That door on my face closed!

248
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,520
Of course.

249
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,180
Doors will always close after being opened.

250
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,680
You did well on dodging my rankyaku.

251
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,550
Yeah, no big deal.

252
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,170
How unexpected.

253
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
You!

254
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,580
He jumped!

255
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,850
He's perfectly caught up to my speed.

256
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,400
He even changed the course of my rankyaku!

257
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,500
His physical abilities are hard to believe.

258
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,210
That's no good!

259
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,400
If I stay like this, it's no good.

260
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,660
When I lost to Ao Kiji, I thought about it.

261
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,180
If strong guys like this are going to appear on our road later...

262
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,640
If I don't get stronger...

263
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,080
I won't be able to protect my nakama.

264
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,810
That's because even if they aren't strong...

265
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,620
I have nakama I want to keep with me.

266
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,890
If I don't get stronger than everyone else,

267
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,470
I'll lose them all!

268
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,720
Then what do you want to do?

269
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,550
I thought about a way to fight at my fullest.

270
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,230
So that I don't lose anyone...

271
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,610
So that I don't let anyone drift away...

272
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,490
What is he doing? 

273
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,890
What's happening inside of his body?

274
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,410
You won't be able...

275
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,660
To keep up with me anymore.

276
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,550
What?

277
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,140
All of my techniques...

278
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,470
are going to evolve by one step!

279
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,830
Gear Second!

280
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,800
It's a good thing I met with you here.

281
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,180
What kind of bluff is that?

282
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,780
Next time, One Piece: All for the Sake of Protecting My Nakama!
Gear Second in Motion!

283
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

284
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,400
Here's how you can get your treasure present!

285
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,910
Write the four letters that appeared in the show, your address, your full name, your age,

286
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,210
your opinion of the show and you may win a lot of prizes!

287
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,920
The last keyword is... this!

1
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,590
Who dares to rub in Franky Family?!

2
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,709
Return to me the money!

3
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,450
“To me the money”, say you Return?

4
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,370
Does that want to say that you are a man of Straw hat?

5
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,520
It is him, Aniki! I wanted to know if a man of Luffy to the Straw hat were so strong that!

6
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,650
But it is only one weakling!

7
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,990
Ca does not concern you!

8
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,400
Oops!

9
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,540
I appreciate your courage to want to bring back only the money, but I cannot you leave it.

10
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,740
Return it to me.

11
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,780
It is…

12
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,320
It is the money which we will use…

13
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,640
To repair our boat.

14
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,780
With this money…

15
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,920
We will be able…

16
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,550
We will be able to finally look after the wounds of Merry!

17
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,680
I you… will not leave it!

18
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:34,960
With the help of a companion!
The attack against Franky House.

19
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,540
Why so much of rage?

20
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,630
You seem to adore this boat.

21
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,680
It does not matter the state of your boat.
This money is with us henceforth.

22
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,490
Unfortunately, in this world, to conceal with the pirates is not a crime.

23
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,450
It is probably of the dirty money which comes by far.

24
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,620
Then, gives us.

25
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,100
If not, you can go to beg the Navy. You will be alone to make you capture.

26
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,330
This time, the unlucky person, it is Luffy with the Straw hat.

27
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,790
Because of a poor useless servant…

28
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,730
Incompetent to protect his money correctly.

29
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,490
The guy, you of him occupy!

30
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,450
I will do a little shopping with all this money.

31
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,379
I will give myself pleasure.

32
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,379
Wait!

33
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,650
HISTSU KUSHI

34
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,430
Remember this, Length-nose:My name is Franky.

35
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,910
If you want to survive in this city… Never cross my way, some is the reason.

36
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,740
What you made?! Leave me!

37
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,310
A poor weapon like that one hurt?

38
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,510
With more, Length-nose!

39
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,260
Thank you for the 200 million.

40
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,550
Wait! Return it to me!

41
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,910
Return it for Merry!

42
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,540
Return it to me!

43
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,880
Return it to me!

44
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,920
Return it to me!

45
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,510
Return it to me.

46
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,150
Return it to me!

47
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,890
Return it to me, please!

48
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,250
I must have patience until the return of Robin.

49
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,840
If I find myself wedged, I will have problems.

50
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,520
I am not reassured.

51
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,490
At all events, I will protect this boat and the 100 million.

52
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,300
I count on you,

53
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,040
the guy.

54
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,330
St-stop!

55
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,600
If I remember well…
It is the place about which Nami spoke.

56
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,660
Included/understood? The street of the market east here.

57
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,669
Then you will borrow this channel for the moment.

58
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,920
There, Usopp is here.

59
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,980
Of agreement.

60
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,330
Another Nami-san thing,

61
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,040
The reference mark of the disassemblers of boats, Franky Family?

62
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,089
Usopp!

63
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,450
Usopp left.

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,029
Be sure for you? One is at the good place at least?

65
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,029
I AM NOT LIKE YOU, WHORE! Your mouth!

66
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,940
Usopp!

67
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,979
What you ace known as?!

68
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,710
What?

69
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,310
Look at, blood.

70
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,230
This cretin started from itself.

71
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,180
Do not say to me only it…

72
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,380
Usopp…

73
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,380
Luffy!

74
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,050
What you insane? From where you come like that?

75
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,570
Shipyard.

76
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,120
I tried to jump like the naval engineer to seek Usopp.

77
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,170
You are well?

78
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,770
I failed to forget! The guy, it is horrible!
Usopp was made choper with the money!

79
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
Ouais, I know.

80
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
Oi, we are not far from their cushy job.

81
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,330
Usopp was made tabasser and they stole the money.

82
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,500
It had to feel responsible… and had to only leave to the meeting Franky Family.

83
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,430
Then all our excuses for today.

84
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,330
Which heading that one.

85
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,259
We do not even know if it has it or not.

86
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,720
I hope that they will show me a little more respect, I must remain discrete by here.

87
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,370
It is Kalifa.

88
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,410
Nmaaa, enters.

89
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,360
Otsukaresama, Iceberg-san.

90
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,170
Do you want to drink something?

91
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,050
Yes…

92
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,469
I would take a little tea today.

93
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,660
I made some.

94
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,850
Maaa, I was sure, Kalifa.

95
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,300
I am grateful to you.

96
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,070
Mr. Kogi always leaves from here while being furious.

97
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,520
Which was the subject of the discussion?

98
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,100
They seek a thing which I hold, then they continue to make me proposals.

99
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,990
It of important, isn't this is something?

100
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,930
Such a thing. I always denied to know anything about it.

101
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,990
These people are tiring.

102
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,790
It breathes, Chopper?

103
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,710
It is frozen…

104
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,440
But he did not die.

105
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,150
They is good, it will be left there.

106
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,240
Remain here…

107
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,000
Usopp.

108
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,650
One will shave this hut immediately.

109
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:47,450
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

110
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,930
Oi, buy to puff out!

111
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,369
One has money, much of money!

112
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,480
Now, one is stuffed of money!

113
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,480
When I was young, I often made the decoration of the houses of people.

114
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,540
Thank you! You found my binoculars!

115
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,080
Yosh, I will tell you the time where I fought against a monstre marin on Calm Belt.

116
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,360
They was largest of all!

117
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,040
I have 8000 men at my sides!

118
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,040
They took all the money,

119
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,760
Nami.

120
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,150
How will I tell that with the others?

121
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,829
Bottez them the bottom…

122
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,790
the guy.

123
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,610
I play that.

124
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,489
Look at, you lost.

125
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,489
Go, will buy more provisions!

126
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,719
Buy all the store!

127
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,220
There is money!

128
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,480
Whore, you will see! I will put a beating to you while returning!

129
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,420
How, that it occurred?!

130
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,450
There is somebody over there!

131
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,620
Who be you?!

132
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,130
It is…

133
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,000
It is…

134
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,870
Luffy with the Straw hat!

135
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,760
You returned to seek the dough? Imbeciles!

136
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,740
Look at how much one is.

137
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,420
What do you hope to four?

138
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,579
But now that you are there,

139
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,590
Give us your settings at price.

140
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,420
It is the captain of this poor Length-nose.

141
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,120
They did not understand that they did not have any chance.

142
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,540
Come, I await you, dead losses.

143
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,350
GOMU GOMU NO…

144
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,380
What you insane?

145
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,530
They is punches? Even a warship could not anything against this armor!

146
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,220
It is delirious!

147
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,300
If you want to play, I will reduce to you out of pulp!

148
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,850
GUN!

149
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,150
It transpierced its giant armor!

150
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,290
Oi!

151
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,279
Wait a little, the guy!

152
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,440
Listen to what one has to say!

153
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,540
To say…

154
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,690
Di…

155
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,730
Draw with the gun!

156
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,940
SANTOU RYU!

157
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,040
KARA SUMA!

158
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,070
Battle song of the demon to the three swords.

159
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,960
… The boulets de canon are out of steel, are to you with the current?

160
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,939
Guns too!

161
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,490
They are… They are insane furious!

162
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,600
We break! We by the door of behind break!

163
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,570
Assume a little bit…

164
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,170
when you must fight.

165
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,090
PARBLE

166
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,650
KICK E

167
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,129
One cannot pass any more by the door of behind!

168
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,440
Windows… By the windows!

169
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,630
RUMBLE

170
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,940
HORN NOT!

171
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,880
ROSEO COLONNADE!

172
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,969
At-At-At-At-await a little, the guys!

173
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,599
It is the money which you want, hein?!

174
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,980
The 200 million which the greenhorn kept!

175
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,309
Ca fears, the money is not there!

176
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,879
Our chief, Franky-aniki, left to make shopping with all the dough!

177
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,770
And we do not know by where it left!

178
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,140
Ca is not used for nothing foutre the brothel, the 200 million will not return!

179
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,640
Zambai!

180
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,560
Close it.

181
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,020
One of fout.

182
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,330
Yes,

183
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,980
it is too late now.

184
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,190
The guy, one will not leave only one crumb of this place.

185
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,559
And us with?!

186
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,819
Baka, seized again!

187
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,479
It is us, Franky Family,…

188
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,929
Who will not leave a crumb of it?!

189
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,359
Show them!

190
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,860
The Speciality of Franky House!

191
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,730
Fire at will!

192
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,019
Here they are! With the attack!

193
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,449
No pity!

194
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,879
Destroy all that falls you under the hand!

195
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,500
They are only four!

196
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,719
It is what this noise? A fire of artifices?

197
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,560
Ca comes from Franky House.

198
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,390
Still them? What do they still prepare us?

199
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,940
And well…

200
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,570
They listen to us!

201
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,710
Oh cherished, they cannot play in silence.

202
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,640
Never, they will include/understand.

203
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,290
They is good, that did not last a long time.

204
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,199
It is splendid…

205
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,160
day.

206
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,330
Does one have to continue Franky?

207
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,130
But where?

208
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,829
Good, they do not seem to know where is the money.

209
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,590
Even if one ends up catching this Franky,

210
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,360
he will have already very spent.

211
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,760
What will one make?

212
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,970
While remaining here, one can await it still a long time.

213
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,539
Oi, I finished first aid!

214
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,980
We will transfer it onto a stretcher, then come to help me please!

215
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,370
Ca is not used for nothing to chatter longer.

216
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,159
In any case, let us turn over to the boat.

217
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,290
Nami-san remained all alone.

218
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,190
It misses Robin-chan, too.

219
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,090
There is also the problem of the boat.

220
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,990
Oi, Luffy!

221
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,260
About the boat…

222
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,680
I made my decision…

223
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,940
It is time to separate from Merry…

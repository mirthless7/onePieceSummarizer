1
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,150
The war of Arabasta!

2
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,150
The city of the dreams:Rainbase

3
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,480
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,030
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,680
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,190
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,170
To stop the madness growing in the kingdom of Arabasta,

8
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,040
princess Vivi hurries to catch up with the army rebels in order to dissuade them.

9
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,590
However…

10
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,200
I want to beat this refuse of Crocodile!

11
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,870
If one stops the rebels, Crocodile will it stop?

12
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,550
Try to risk our lives at the same time as holds it!

13
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,450
We are your companions!

14
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,740
Say to me.

15
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,740
Where is Crocodile?

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,940
Vivi made its decision!

17
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,550
You all.

18
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,850
Luffy-San rightly.

19
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,150
I had a reason.

20
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,620
We must go where Crocodile is.

21
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,470
Ouais.

22
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,210
It is certainly the best thing to be made.

23
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,350
Super, and not of turning to nut this time.

24
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,290
Ah yes?

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,820
Where is this dumb of Crocodile?

26
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,870
Let us see…

27
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,690
Here the Alubarna capital, where my father controls.

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,910
Here the road which Alubarna will borrow the rebellious army to attack.

29
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,860
Therefore, one has just to beat Crocodile before they are there.

30
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,330
And Crocodile…

31
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,790
… is there.

32
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,490
Rainbase.

33
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,790
Rainbase?

34
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,260
While going towards North, one will be there within one day or more.

35
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,440
Hey, I already said you to stop with your “Aaah”!

36
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,680
Close it! It is easy to say for you who voyages to back of camel!

37
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,510
Ouais, lets go up to us too!

38
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,080
Woman-camel!

39
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,170
Nami-camel!

40
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,500
Not badly!

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,440
Chopper, you have just been beaten.

42
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,070
Yes, will be necessary that I involve myself.

43
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,170
Vivi will, be there water with Rainbase?

44
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,930
Yes, this place is very prosperous.

45
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,240
The city was saved by the rebellion and is recognized for its casinos.

46
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,760
Casinos!?

47
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,490
Do He, He, of what you think?

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,340
There remains at least a merry city in this kingdom.

49
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,740
“Da Lady” means “Not question”

50
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,840
Nan!

51
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,340
Nan!

52
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,690
Nan!

53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,360
I said not!

54
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,800
Give the-me!

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,720
Go! Just a mouthful!

56
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,060
It gave it well to us to drink it, not?

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,070
Ossan spent one night to be dug for this water!

58
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,160
Then one will not drink it of only one blow, moron!

59
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,360
Can't Waoh, you remain quiet a little?

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,330
Of course that I can!

61
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,720
But it is hard!

62
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,570
VERY HARD!

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,510
I can take one step more.

64
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,670
Of… of water…

65
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Then one arrives at Rainbase or not?

66
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,130
Luffy-San.

67
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,340
Thank you.

68
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,980
I would never have been so determined without you.

69
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,830
Give me to eat.

70
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,820
After having exploded Crocodile, you will give me to eat until I die about it.

71
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,970
Yes, I promise it to you!

72
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,390
Katorea - Camp of the Army Rebels

73
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,850
Please, Kohza!

74
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,150
Let join the rebellious army to me!

75
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,190
Not question.

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,620
Why not?

77
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,410
I have the right to join the rebellious army, not?

78
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,890
I hate the King!

79
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,620
Let fight to me with you!

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,350
Falafra, shows him.

81
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,970
It had that during a battle by protecting me.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,930
You want to throw an eye with the infirmary and the cemetery too?

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
I…

84
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,010
AI NOT FEAR!!!

85
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,600
The King stole the rain, the cities are dry and much of people died.

86
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,730
My friends are falls ills!

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,740
It is the fault of the King!

88
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,630
I want to fight too!

89
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,780
I am not afraid to be wounded or to die!

90
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,830
Then returns at home.

91
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,290
Because you are mistaken.

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,140
Everyone is afraid and nobody wants to fight.

93
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,200
Then why do you fight?

94
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,110
One does not want to fight.

95
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,180
But it is owed.

96
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,220
It is what the country wanted.

97
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,490
I insane that you understand or not.

98
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,630
Release!

99
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,570
I said to you to release.

100
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,690
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR the CHILDREN!

101
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,180
What doesn't go, Kohza?

102
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,190
To howl on a kid, that does not resemble itself.

103
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,670
He resembles to me, when I was small.

104
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,360
Ca irritated me.

105
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,110
I did not change much.

106
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,350
Do you have the weapons?

107
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,400
Not, that takes more time than envisaged.

108
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,370
Send a message to our troops in each city.

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,330
As soon as we have arm, we will attack Alubarna into simultaneous.

110
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,000
Your Majesty, it is nothing any more but one matter of time before the rebellion does not attack Alubarna.

111
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,760
We must attack as long as we can it!

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,090
THE FARM!

113
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,800
Not question!

114
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,560
You want to fight like kids or what?

115
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,440
You are struck, you strike?

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,030
But in this case, the kingdom will be in danger.

117
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,740
And then?

118
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,720
Since the incident of Dance Powder,

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,200
there is no more doubt about the fact that somebody wishes to destroy this country.

120
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,230
Without knowing do its identity, you want to exterminate your people?

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,720
It is what would destroy this country.

122
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,080
You understand? A country it is people.

123
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,690
But there is no idea of the identity of that which scheme all that.

124
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,250
If it is waited until it destroys the country gradually, it will be too late!

125
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,270
Your Majesty!

126
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,630
Not question!

127
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,130
understand me.

128
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,180
The King will not let to us attack.

129
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,870
One can remain both nothing to make.

130
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,880
So only Igaram-San was there…

131
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,490
Does Igaram take a short leave?

132
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,830
Igaram-San must have joined Vivi-Sama.

133
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,260
To discover the identity of the plotter.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,870
Or can they be well?

135
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,770
Chaka-Sama! Pell-Sama!

136
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,490
What is there?

137
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,330
Karu is of return!

138
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,240
Karu?

139
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,280
Majesty, this letter…?

140
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,720
It is without any doubt the writing of Vivi.

141
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,770
Majesty, you want to say that…

142
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,420
Did Karu come to deliver this letter of Vivi-Sama?

143
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,500
Father, all that is writing is the truth.

144
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,340
The man who upset our country and brought suffering and destruction to us…

145
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,080
… is not other than Crocodile!

146
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,570
Igaram fell vis-a-vis Crocodile.

147
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,880
He died.

148
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,590
Crocodile…

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,430
I relied on him, because he is member of the government…!

150
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,900
Who could the suspecter have wanted to reign on our country?

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,750
Igaram-San is…

152
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,480
It gave its life to protect Vivi-Sama and our country.

153
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,450
And now, I am with people who gave me a capacity without limits.

154
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,590
If we can continue together, something will change in this country.

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,440
A glimmer of hope is there.

156
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,970
Arabasta will be surely saved.

157
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,580
Believe in us, father, please.

158
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,750
Vivi.

159
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,880
It is written that you also risked your life in the battle.

160
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,900
Karu, you are courageous.

161
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,070
You are wounded?

162
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,230
Show to me.

163
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,580
No matter what it arrives now…

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,760
… this left arm proves that we are companions!

165
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,010
Chaka!

166
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,850
We know the enemy, now.

167
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,960
Joined together soldiers for the battle.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,660
One should not leave the efforts of Vivi reduced to nothing and the unpunished death of Igaram.

169
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,820
We will immediately tackle the base of Crocodile with Rainbase.

170
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,310
Wait, your majesty!

171
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,680
Even if one leaves now, Rainbase is far from here!

172
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,960
Moreover, Crocodile is regarded as the defender of the people!

173
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,690
Forgive what I will say,

174
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,020
but think there.

175
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,920
If one attacks Rainbase now,

176
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,980
the rebellious army will jump on the occasion to attack and occupy the palate.

177
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,290
If that arrives…

178
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,670
And then, if the palate falls to the hands from the rebellious army?

179
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,600
I said it presently to you, a country it is people!

180
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,490
If the royal army is devastated,

181
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,310
if one beats Crocodile,

182
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,050
the country will reappear with the hands of its people.

183
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,910
But if we remain here to discuss the army rebels…

184
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,990
… that which will laugh the last will be Crocodile!

185
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,760
Your Majesty…

186
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,720
You went so far…

187
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,220
If we are likely to stop the army rebels…

188
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,500
If we can beat Crocodile, I of it will be satisfied.

189
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,380
Our adversary is one of Shichibukai.

190
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,650
Crocodile is not insane.

191
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,060
This battle will not be completed without sacrifices.

192
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:12,930
Chaka!

193
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,060
Convene your officers for a conference of war!

194
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,110
Pell!

195
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,420
You leave in front of and make a recognition of the enemy camp.

196
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:19,980
Majesty.

197
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,550
It seems that this time still we underestimated this man.

198
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,180
What a incredible will!

199
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,330
We will leave to fallen the night.

200
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,710
Majesty!

201
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,850
All the soldiers will walk on Rainbase!

202
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,530
One is there.

203
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,770
One succeeded?

204
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,010
Rainbase?

205
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,160
One is there!

206
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,650
Crocodile!

207
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,930
YOSH!

208
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,870
I WILL EXPLODE You the MOUTH, CROCODILE!

209
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,520
Then it is that, Rainbase.

210
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,790
Do Hey, you think that Baroque Works knows that we are there?

211
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,390
It is possible.

212
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,860
One met Mr. 2 while coming here.

213
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,280
It is more advisable to be said than they know than we are there.

214
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,430
And then?

215
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,460
They will recognize us.

216
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,680
One will not be able to run to hide in Rainbase.

217
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,710
WHY NOT?

218
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,640
Because if they find us in first,

219
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,140
one will not be able to put the hand on Crocodile.

220
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,180
The assassination is their speciality, after all.

221
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,320
OUAIS! LEAVE, CROCODILE!!!!!

222
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,620
Did you listen, stunned!?

223
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,780
It does not matter which tries to stop us.

224
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,640
I will protect Nami-San and Vivi-Chan!

225
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,090
You can call me Prince, both!

226
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,270
Prince.

227
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,260
I WILL KILL YOU, DUMB!

228
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,670
Prince!

229
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,900
Water!

230
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,510
Close it, you two!

231
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,310
Above all, I need water!

232
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,770
ME TOO!

233
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,050
Water, water!!!!

234
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,790
Wait, Luffy!

235
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,060
Ah! Take money with you!

236
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,750
Colonel Smoker?

237
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,140
You think that the pirates of Straw hat will come in Rainbase?

238
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,900
Surely.

239
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,010
Just a feeling.

240
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,400
ONE CAN FINALLY DRINK WATER, USOPP!

241
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,400
Water!!

242
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,870
There is something which does not go in this country.

243
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,990
As if a shade hid behind all that.

244
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,900
Excuse me.

245
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,090
Excuse we, can one have water, please?

246
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,830
Water! Give us the barrel!

247
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,960
Five! Five barrels! Five!

248
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,180
But you are sure that Baroque Works is related to the pirates of Straw hat?

249
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,530
Here.

250
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,660
All that I know…

251
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,390
… it is that this Straw hat is after Crocodile, one of Shichibukai.

252
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,910
Ca it is water! Name of god!

253
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,540
Sacrament good, this water!

254
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,450
One should hurry and bring back some to the others!

255
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,230
I will make a turn.

256
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,830
One does perhaps not should have sent these two zigotos for that.

257
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,060
It is not hard, they can do it.

258
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,530
You believe?

259
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,570
They surely will run while bringing problems with them.

260
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,740
One would make better prepare.

261
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,870
COURSE!

262
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,400
OUAIS!

263
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,790
TAKE THE BARRELS!

264
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,060
OUAIS!

265
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,690
Shit!

266
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,910
Join the men, Tashigi!
They are continued!

267
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,630
Yes, Colonel!

268
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,040
How much does one owe you?

269
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,700
If they are your friends, it will be necessary to pay for them too.

270
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,190
O- Yes, sorry for the disturbance.

271
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,810
What the Navy fout here??

272
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,680
How I would know it??

273
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,250
Continue to run!

274
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,460
They are made courser by the Navy once again…

275
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,020
I hope that it is a joke????

276
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,480
Then why it runs by here?

277
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,260
But Tony-Kun did not return from the toilets!

278
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,440
Then let us leave it!

279
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
He can take care of itself!

280
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,610
THE GUY, THE MARINE EAST!!!

281
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,740
BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW YOU, JERK!

282
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,250
ONE WILL CATCH YOU, THIS TIME!

283
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,430
These goods with nothing are good to run, at least!

284
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,170
One would not have

285
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,410
to run in the city,

286
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,630
if not Baroque Works will see us!

287
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,660
I believe that it is too late.

288
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,040
Then there are not the choice!

289
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,700
Allons-y!

290
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,360
What?

291
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,210
In Crocodile!

292
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,930
From agreement, Vivi?

293
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,450
Yes!

294
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,790
You see this building with the crocodile on the roof?

295
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,150
It is the casino of Crocodile, Rain Dinners!

296
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,570
Then it is that…

297
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,530
It is there that Crocodile is!

298
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,230
One would make better separate!

299
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,610
It is a beginning of plan.

300
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,400
Well! One finds oneself over there!

301
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,690
Yes!

302
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,880
At Croco!

303
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,160
They separated!

304
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,360
Do not let escape!

305
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,280
Come me to seek, Smokey!

306
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,370
Be courageous for you!

307
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,660
But do not believe to be able to run without end!

308
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,380
It was right…

309
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,950
Shit!

310
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,000
Ah it is really pretty.

311
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,810
Where are parties?

312
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,410
Odor of Luffy!

313
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,330
Odor of Zoro!

314
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,230
But Sanji left by there!

315
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,600
What occurs?

316
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,280
MOVE OF!

317
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,380
Stop!

318
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,280
Mr. Bushido, they arrive by here too.

319
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,920
Look at, it is well them!

320
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:34,930
Kill them!

321
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,680
The Million Works Baroque!

322
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,970
Tiger in front of, wolf behind, hein?

323
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,730
Passes in front.

324
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,240
Grouille!

325
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,040
O- Yes!

326
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,770
Usopp!

327
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,630
Take care of Nami-San!

328
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,450
What?

329
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,370
I will deal with these.

330
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,990
Of agreement, shows them who is the Boss!

331
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,730
Sanji-Kun!

332
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,230
Leave!

333
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,120
One breaks!

334
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,720
Without this dumb of smoker, you are only small fry.

335
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,340
My condolences.

336
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,520
I hope that Mr. Bushido will draw some!

337
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,120
Not good enough!

338
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,540
Still test.

339
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,510
Roronoa Zoro.

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,720
One still meets.

341
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,440
This voice…

342
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,920
Ca makes a lease that I seek you.

343
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,170
To attack the innocent ones does, what that want to say?

344
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,640
I have my reasons!

345
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,890
And looks at, I do not want to fight against you.

346
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,710
Our duel finished in Logue Town.

347
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,970
Not it is not it.

348
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,100
We did not really cross iron!

349
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,900
It resembles to him, it resembles to him too much!

350
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,000
DECREE TO RESEMBLE TO HIM AS MUCH!

351
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,820
What you say?!

352
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,200
You continuous to insult me?

353
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,760
I will not forgive you your spite!

354
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,420
Shit, it is the only one which I cannot fight!

355
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,520
Wait!

356
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,630
Dumbs!

357
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,290
Remain here!!!!

358
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,980
Nooooooooooon!!!

359
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,630
No the problem, it is well them!

360
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,960
I have… I succeeded!

361
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,620
Super, Usopp!

362
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,290
Look at, it is there!

363
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,770
The entry of Rain Dinners!

364
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,290
It built it in the middle of a lake!

365
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,000
Didn't the others arrive yet?

366
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,160
Well! Aim and draw!

367
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,430
One will start with these deux-là!

368
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,750
ENEMIES!!!!!

369
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,800
Zoro!

370
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,390

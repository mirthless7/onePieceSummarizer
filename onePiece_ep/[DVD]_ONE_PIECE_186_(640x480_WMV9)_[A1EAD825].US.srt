1
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,629
Nami was trapped on the Maxim Arch until the arrival of its two savers…

2
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,510
Sanji and Usopp.

3
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,760
One already had to be made locate
by the enemy since one moment.

4
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,140
They know that one is there?
How one makes now?

5
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,470
Useless to worry some!

6
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,859
When one is inside, one
separate and one goes on the bridge.

7
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,770
Nami-san
find over there!

8
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,150
During this time, after Eneru took with the trap its arm in a gold ball…

9
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,280
and made it fall from Maxim
in the Ruins of Shandora,

10
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,280
Luffy is raised again
to regulate its accounts!

11
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,279
Good!

12
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,329
Shit!

13
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,499
I do not manage to remove
this gold testicle!

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,990
Do not speak about testicle!

15
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,199
Usopp arrives in time for
to save Nami of this mud pit,

16
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,929
but it is not size with
to face the power of Eneru…

17
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,170
and it is on the point
to remain there, when…

18
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,080
EL

19
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,290
Sanji-kun!

20
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,769
You bar!

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,210
THOR

22
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,140
I sought fire
to light my cig.

23
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:22,600
Capriccio of the Destruction
The imminent destiny of the celestial island!!

24
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,530
Chialer?

25
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,480
Really?

26
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,570
What?!

27
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,440
The Arch!

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,189
Bastard!

29
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,100
You would have…

30
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,819
Ouais.

31
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,810
Prepare with chialer.

32
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,480
Dumb!

33
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,069
What you have…

34
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,940
fact in the boat?!

35
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,439
Species…

36
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,110
of bloody nuisance.

37
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,749
One of the gears was moved.

38
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,740
I must position it back.

39
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,170
Good, it left.

40
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,260
Do not make any you.

41
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,020
Nami fell without
damage on the ilonimbus.

42
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,360
C-C' is high!

43
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,179
JSe do not have to fall into the jungle.

44
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,699
I should not fall on the ruins.

45
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,860
It is necessary just that I concentrate
to reach the ilonimbus.

46
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,329
usopp

47
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,870
[Note:Hopping = Scintillation]

48
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,759
I have S-S-sautée
too much far!

49
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,330
I jumped too far!

50
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,389
NOOOOOON!!!!

51
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,389
Oh not! I fall!

52
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,809
I will be crushed! I will be crushed!

53
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,470
I will be crushed and creveeeeer!

54
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,980
I forgot to detach it!

55
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,709
Usopp! Sanji-kun!

56
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,049
Is Oh, it you, Nami?

57
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,679
It would be said that you left yourself there!

58
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,250
What a relief!

59
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,259
He, Sanji!

60
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,549
Are Sanji-kun, you well?

61
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,959
You ace be heroic presently!

62
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,810
I am sorry that you would be
still wounded because of us.

63
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,969
He, you ace not interest of clamser!

64
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,099
He!

65
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,419
J-J' chokes!

66
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,979
I choke!

67
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,010
N-Nami! Quickly! Hurry
to leave me from there!

68
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,300
Oh, sorry.

69
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,479
In any case…

70
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,310
it is necessary that one leaves from here!

71
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,109
Why I am not able to release you?!

72
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,270
I die.

73
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,540
Cursed living Blue Sea.

74
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,260
You believed that my Arch
would be so easy to destroy?

75
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,060
I know perfectly its
mechanisms of propulsion.

76
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,189
Even without electrical energy,

77
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,859
there is a back-up system
coming from my terre natale, Bilka…

78
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,230
who uses the power
from two hundreds Jet Dials…

79
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,290
and it can maintain the Arch
in the airs one hour whole.

80
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,870
You can resist
as much as you want!

81
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,010
The end of this country is imminent!

82
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,139
Look at this giant bean.

83
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,809
If it is the same one as
I saw since the ruins,

84
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,399
then this ilonimbus
is just above.

85
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,439
Ruins…

86
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,729
L it Quoted of Gold?!

87
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,800
You found it?!

88
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,069
Yes.

89
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,430
But, Eneru took all gold.

90
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,469
In any way, ruins
are in lower part of us.

91
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,319
Ruins of Shandora

92
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,589
Zoro and others
are surely over there.

93
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,339
Current location

94
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,089
Current location

95
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,670
Current location

96
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,940
I am not sure of what
you say in connection with the ground…

97
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,620
but I have the feeling which it goes us
to arrive of the trifles if one remains there.

98
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,289
Completely. Go up!

99
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,079
The others should be found
and to draw from this island.

100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
D-D' agreement!

101
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,050
There is no more no place
with the shelter on Skypiea.

102
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,640
Luffy, pay to!

103
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,310
It is too fast!

104
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,819
L-Luffy, wait!

105
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,869
It is not by there!

106
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,070
Goes on the left! On the left!

107
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,780
Mr.-MR.-but I cannot
to turn also quickly!

108
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,360
[Note:Hook = Hook]

109
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,790
DO NOT DESTROY THE ISCED OF MY ANCESTORS!

110
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,889
One can see Giant Jack up there!

111
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,420
I know, but…

112
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,880
DECREE ALL TO BREAK!

113
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,700
HE!!

114
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,439
Yes.

115
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,930
The clouds of flashes are
quite again charged.

116
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,310
The rat gave up.

117
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,730
Really shameless.

118
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,579
But it does not matter.

119
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,280
No matter what it arrives,
my official reception will be magic.

120
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,690
Hein?

121
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,499
Robin is not there any more.

122
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,989
Zoro and Chopper either.

123
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,330
Neither Wiper and nor God.

124
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,540
Where did they pass?

125
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,340
They had to climb.

126
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,509
Oh, Robin had to take them along.

127
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,340
Good, allons-y.

128
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,050
He, Aisa?

129
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,770
I do not know.

130
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,229
Listen well.

131
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,569
If nothing is done, this country…

132
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,709
Skypiea will be destroyed.

133
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,240
The celestial island?

134
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,740
Our village too?

135
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,950
All.

136
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,879
Each man, woman and
child in the sky…

137
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,170
will turn over to surface.

138
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,540
Luffy…

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,389
Ouais?

140
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,510
The celestial island…

141
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,050
really will be destroyed?

142
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,940
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

143
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,340
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

144
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,040
As soon as one is
left, I will see Wiper.

145
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,380
I suspected it, the arch
direct towards the Large Belfry.

146
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,559
What it arrived at Madam
Navigatrice and others?

147
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,890
I really hope that they
are not on this arch.

148
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,850
One succeeded!

149
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,279
Up there!

150
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,570
Luffy! Stop! Stop!

151
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,369
Robin!

152
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,490
What you make?!

153
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,400
Deal with
these deux-là!

154
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,360
Stop! Stop!

155
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,160
Luffy!

156
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,050
It has arms which push!

157
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,719
From which does this gold leave which hangs with your arm?

158
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,020
Robin, the Bell of Gold is with
is top of bean, it that?

159
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,430
Does Eneru want the bell, not true?

160
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,729
If the Belfry exists,

161
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,130
GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

162
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,319
G Y HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS

163
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,239
But, even if…

164
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,630
OK!

165
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,850
Luffy!

166
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,230
It left.

167
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,310
Then, young girl.

168
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,199
Did you see Madam Navigatrice?

169
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,579
A girl with orange hair.

170
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,410
You speak about Nami?
She is on the arch.

171
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,200
Hein? I hear only one
only voice in the sky.

172
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,330
Here they are!

173
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,010
He, Robin!

174
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,459
Madam Navigatrice!

175
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,519
Long Nose-kun!

176
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,830
Cook-san!

177
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,890
Aisa!

178
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,389
Good!

179
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,510
I am content that you are well!

180
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,390
Nami!

181
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,479
Zoro!

182
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,569
Chopper!

183
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,099
Odd Papi!

184
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,139
E-and the warrior!

185
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,480
Brothel, everyone is K.O. !

186
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,829
So only I had been there!

187
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,489
Oh, Aisa. Where is Luffy?

188
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,070
It was not with you?

189
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,820
Luffy left to save you, Nami!

190
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,620
It climbed bean
to face Eneru!

191
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,629
What?

192
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,490
Has Zut, one just missed it?

193
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,859
Just at the moment.

194
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,960
I tried to stop it.

195
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,899
This guy never reflects!

196
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,259
There are not any more time!

197
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,130
If one does not draw quickly from here…

198
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,650
Ok, I will follow it with Waver.

199
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,309
You, find a means
to reach Merry!

200
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,460
What?

201
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,979
Shit!

202
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,310
This boat is fast!

203
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,070
ENERU!!

204
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,279
Go up on board boats!

205
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,440
The sky becomes completely black!

206
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,999
That there
does it have?

207
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,789
It is quickly necessary to leave.

208
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,879
Chief…

209
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,790
Aisa is always over there!

210
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,820
It did not return yet?

211
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,799
Aisa is an intelligent girl.

212
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,639
Let us hope that it is
with one of the warriors.

213
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,090
Yes.

214
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,759
Go! Made quickly!

215
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,910
Captain!

216
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,939
If we do not use
boats on the quay,

217
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,520
there will not be enough
of place for all!

218
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,819
It would be too long to reach them…

219
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,739
You!

220
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,449
Use emergency Dials
to create a river!

221
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,430
Yes, Chief!

222
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,539
You all, please! You must join Cloud End on bank of the cloud…

223
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,990
and to flee towards
Blue sea immediately!

224
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,419
Eneru God with the intention
to destroy this country!

225
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,200
While remaining here, NONE
will not survive us!

226
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,919
Since six years,

227
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,960
over all, we know that Eneru…

228
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,599
the capacity of us has
to bring despair!

229
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,590
And this time, it is for soon!

230
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,800
What good is it to await a miracle?!

231
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,779
Before requesting,

232
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,769
before closing the eyes on reality,

233
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:27,520
we must initially make
what is in our capacity!

234
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,480
We cannot hide us
behind its victims to survive!

235
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,279
If we do not do anything,

236
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,029
it does not matter with which it fault,

237
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,860
we will have lost our lives!

238
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,500
Now,

239
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,030
you must be solved
to leave this country!

240
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,789
How much inhabitants left?!

241
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,500
Almost half.

242
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,049
Do not let them take luggage!

243
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,879
Evacuate the island all
whole towards the sea!

244
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,330
Yes, Chief!

245
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,699
Wait!

246
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,310
Each one must pay the tax of unloading of 2.000.000 000 of Extols before leaving!

247
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,609
Amazon-san!

248
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,720
You must flee you too!

249
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,560
Join Cloud End
as quickly as possible!

250
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,770
This country…

251
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,320
will be destroyed!!

252
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, the wind stopped.

253
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,670
Will run! Will run!

254
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,010
The hour came.

255
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,220
And now, the official reception.

256
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,180
It is time to start.

257
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,340
[Note:God of the thunder of
aboriginals of central Australia]

258
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,249
You move away from the island!

259
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,950
You do not turn over!

260
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,969
The flashes are increasingly large!

261
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,929
They attack also the quay!

262
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,549
Go on the west coast of the beach!

263
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,969
As quickly as possible!

264
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,349
There remain still boats!

265
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,880
Flee towards the West!

266
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,389
As quickly as possible!

267
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,340
Drop your luggage!

268
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,359
Chief!

269
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,980
We must make you go up on board!

270
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,840
Yes.

271
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,150
Large Karugara Warrior!

272
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,860
Please, protects to us all!

273
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
These flashes are enormous!

274
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,460
If one remains there, it will not remain of
us that ash in the sky!

275
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,929
The guy, turn over to the boat!

276
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,439
I will seek Luffy
and I catch up with you!

277
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
O-Ok! Included/understood!

278
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,060
Quickly, Robin!

279
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,239
It is necessary to find a means of
to carry to the boat!

280
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
Wiper!

281
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,060
Mister Epéiste!

282
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,829
Odd Papi!

283
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,839
Brilliant, you are awaked!

284
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,580
He, one does not have any more it
time! You can walk?

285
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,540
Did Eneru start?

286
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,179
We dispatch.

287
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,880
There are not only us
let us can make here.

288
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,510
Wiper…

289
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,839
Even Luffy cannot anything against
an enemy who can fly!

290
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,449
I must reach it before
total disappearance of this country!

291
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,270
It is necessary to flee from here!

292
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,910
Splendid!

293
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,639
Do not believe to draw you like that,

294
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,810
Eneru!

1
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,690
Fact of shitting! Fact of shitting! Fact of shitting!

2
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,950
Why is it necessary that one is made attack by the Navy now?

3
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,300
If you want to remain in life, keep silent yourself and row!

4
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,040
ONE GOES MOURIIIR!

5
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,110
He, Luffy!

6
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,280
You would not come to give us a knack!?

7
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,730
I cannot. I am tired too much…

8
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,180
I did not eat anything since the breakfast.

9
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,390
You ace hunger now!?

10
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,290
Major!

11
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,290
Major Pasqua!

12
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,050
Please please go on the bridge immediately!

13
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,180
Major Pasqua!

14
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,410
Major Pasqua!

15
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,830
Stop jacasser, cretin.

16
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,610
I had already heard the first time.

17
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,380
My excuses, Major.

18
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,280
But the man whom one continues is infamous Monkey D. Luffy!

19
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,200
What?

20
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,620
You were quite long.

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,190
You failed to miss this historical event.

22
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,720
Ouais, gives me the binoculars.

23
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,380
That is not any doubt.

24
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,730
It is undoubtedly the flag with the straw hat of Luffy.

25
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,980
Of course.

26
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,000
This idiot…

27
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,760
We sent shootings of warning,

28
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,030
But they do not have the air not decided to yield.

29
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,090
Major, if you could, please.

30
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,700
Me, hein?

31
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,240
You are only incompetents.

32
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,140
It left.

33
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,330
Wah, it will do it!

34
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,860
The infallible attack of the Major!

35
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,960
Known legendary technique to have run innumerable pirate ships, Finger Bomb!

36
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,720
Euh.

37
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,300
What do you make, Major!?

38
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,770
It was what that?

39
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,620
They ran their own ship?

40
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,790
Take that, stupid Navy!

41
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,820
I had planned all that since the beginning!

42
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,330
When had planned you that?

43
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,650
Yosh.

44
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,630
Now one can use the side which this ship covered to escape!

45
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,020
Help the men of the vessel in perdition!

46
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,940
Are He, you well the guy!?

47
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,460
Going Merry is already out of sight.

48
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,820
Yosh!

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,450
It is not a good thing!!

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,840
It seems that the wheel of the destiny changed camp

51
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,840
We were so close to capturing Going Merry!

52
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,740
Yes, all occurs as he was written.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,540
And now he escapes, Major Pasqua!

54
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,570
All the crew! This ship will carry on its road towards Ruluka

55
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:49,580
The legend of Rainbow Myst!

56
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:49,580
Old the Henzo of the island of Ruluka.

57
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,530
You see the Navy?

58
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,240
It seems that they were sown.

59
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,010
The combat by here are really dangerous.

60
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,840
With two sought criminals on board this ship,

61
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,580
It is not astonishing that the eyes of the Navy turn to the red when they see us.

62
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,290
Nico Robin 79 million Berrys.

63
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,900
Monkey D. Luffy 30 million Berrys (100 million actually)

64
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,450
Roronoa Zoro (60 million Berrys actually)

65
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,550
Luffy…

66
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,850
That is to say careful.

67
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,560
It with the air to have there many rocks immersed in the corner.

68
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,490
A port!

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,950
Really!? A port!?

70
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,910
Look at! One can see the headlight!

71
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,190
A port…

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,340
Ca wants to say that one finally will be able to eat!

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,390
Hein?

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,550
I do not have the impression that it is a headlight.

75
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,040
It is really a large tower.

76
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,580
One of insane! Let us seek to eat!

77
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,220
To eat!

78
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,940
I have already all that I need.

79
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,810
Essuie dribble on your figure!

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,630
You there, halt!

81
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,410
If you intend to drop anchor in the port of the island of Ruluka, or even on the rock funds,

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,830
You must pay the harbor tax!

83
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,210
The harbor tax?

84
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,010
Well, he says that one will have to give money to leave the ship here.

85
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,040
He!

86
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,580
Why does one have to pay for only leaving our ship here?

87
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,030
Because it is the rule!

88
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,030
Will you pay, yes or not?

89
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,080
He.

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,040
Do not point that on an young girl.

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,710
What!?

92
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,260
To eat!!

93
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,980
To eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat!

94
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,860
This moron…

95
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,830
Does that go?

96
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,040
Yes, I am perfectly well!

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,860
Well, then allons-y.

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,470
I want to buy paper for my charts.

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,280
I will accompany you, Nami-san!

100
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,250
J I come too!

101
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,600
H-He wait! I come too!

102
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,330
He, you there!

103
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,510
I will like to ask you something!

104
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,520
A new kind of actor, perhaps?

105
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,150
Ca could be a false merchant.

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,090
You are wrong both!

107
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,870
One among you T it has seen a Rainbow of the Fogs during your voyage?

108
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,390
What?

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,100
A Rainbow of the Fogs?

110
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,760
Ca is useful has anything. It is an idiot.

111
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,970
You judges right from that?

112
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,750
Is He, what there!?

113
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,950
It is you who put the question! It is what this attitude!?

114
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,030
Could you please explain us that of which you want to speak?

115
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,080
Ossan, another!

116
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,820
Of course.

117
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,960
Special for Mister.

118
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,290
One second for me too!

119
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,740
Here for you, speciality of the day.

120
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,410
He, you would make have money better.

121
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,240
Ouais, it is occupied some.

122
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,580
He, why ME!?

123
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,210
I will tell you the secrecy of the Rainbow of the Fogs.

124
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,100
It is right that you pay.

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,300
It is not even me which required!!

126
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,540
My name is Henzo.

127
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,310
I am a brilliant scientific genius, which studies the Rainbow of the Fogs.

128
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,890
Who will dare to qualify genius?

129
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,540
It is generally those which are called themselves of the geniuses which appear finally as finished idiots…

130
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,290
Mr. Henzo.

131
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,430
Call me Professor.

132
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,490
He.

133
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,650
Did you hear of this book?

134
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,020
This book…!

135
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,400
I obtained it in Arabasta.

136
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,540
It is true.

137
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,190
I said myself well that I had heard of the Rainbow of the Fogs…

138
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,710
It is the title of the book which Robin read.

139
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,300
This book was written there is more than 40 years, and the author is unknown.

140
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,990
If one believes the book of it, the Rainbow of the Fogs leads to the Country of the Gods… and the Gold City, El Dorado.

141
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,450
It is only one legend.

142
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:02,760
Many adventurers came here, with the research of the Rainbow of the Fogs, because of this legend.

143
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,000
But not only one did not return from there.

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
Yes, even some of my friends.

145
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,380
It is thus for that you study the Fog…

146
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,160
He, Mister.

147
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,210
You should not take as much with serious what this type tells.

148
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,120
What do you want to say?

149
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,780
It is only the dog of the Whetton Mayor.

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,920
Dog?

151
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:29,860
Ouais!

152
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,960
It obtains financings by the Mayor, and it saw that.

153
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,420
It is only one impostor!

154
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,840
The team of collection!

155
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,430
The team of collection is there!

156
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,640
What is what…?

157
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,300
He, dispatch to finish your glass!

158
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,100
Well, well, citizens.

159
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,650
Do you appreciate your meals?

160
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,420
You there. It is good beer which you are drinking.

161
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,180
When you drink, you must pay the tax on drinks.

162
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,530
He, wait one minute, please!

163
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,670
The money in this wallet is useful to me has to nourish my wife and my children!

164
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,460
You must pay the taxes as a citizen.

165
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,740
Whoever does not satisfy this obligation…

166
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,520
No right to life in this city has.

167
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,040
What does it have this type?

168
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,970
It is the son of the Mayor Whetton, Philippe.

169
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,580
It is a species of dumb who puts taxation of all that one makes.

170
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,240
Well, well, wouldn't this be Professeur Henzo?

171
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,180
My father sought you.

172
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,660
He worried about the advance of your research on the Fog.

173
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,580
As usual.

174
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,750
Considering one does not know when nor where the Fog will appear.

175
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,060
Which pity.

176
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,940
Your research is financed by the taxes of these brave men citizens.

177
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,280
The tower of the Rainbow is also in construction according to your research.

178
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,870
Did you forget that the more you will spend time, the more you will annoy these poor citizens?

179
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,990
Well, excuse me.

180
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,360
Well, well.

181
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,940
You there. You a large dish of spaghetti, isn't this eats?

182
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,690
Ouais.

183
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,520
I was famished.

184
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,900
People who eat large dishes must pay great taxation of food.

185
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,090
Ben, it is him which pays today.

186
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,630
Why me!?

187
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,570
Why was it necessary that I pay?

188
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,440
Fact of shitting…

189
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,190
Thank you!

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,080
You are well foutu of me!

191
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,100
Now you saw your own eyes.

192
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,750
Unless you do not want to be rejected by the population…

193
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,140
You do not approach Henzo.

194
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,290
Thank you for the warning.

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,570
But it is not me which will decide.

196
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,450
It is our Captain.

197
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,720
You are…

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
You are still buying tricks?

199
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,240
Of course!

200
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,590
Ca would be terrible if I did not have any more paper whereas we are on the open sea!

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,310
But it would be said that you buy a ton of useless things…

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,770
I will be able to make shopping until the depths of the hell if it is with Nami-san…!

203
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,940
You are!

204
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,020
It is them, just there, Mister!

205
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,010
Then it is you the poor cretins which refused to pay the harbor tax.

206
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,790
I am the small son of the Mayor Whetton, Reik.

207
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,130
I will have to force you to pay the tax.

208
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,010
If you cannot pay, you will have to leave!

209
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,390
I do not know what occurs, but…

210
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,460
If you intend to stop our amusing session of shopping,

211
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,760
I would make you regret it.

212
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,500
Sanji!

213
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,240
Shit! What does it make?

214
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,760
I do not know…

215
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,890
At the time or I touched his body, I felt an electric shock.

216
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,020
It is useless.

217
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,400
It is what arrives at all those which try to raise the hand on me.

218
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,010
Electricity?

219
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
I see, it with the one of the capacities of a Fruit of the Demon!

220
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,540
It uses a generator!?

221
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,360
Equip with Dynamo, send the juice!

222
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,070
You know what? Ca does not feel good.

223
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,770
Now you will test the true power of my electric combination!

224
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,340
Rolling Thunder!

225
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,340
[Waves of flash]

226
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,370
Hein? Flashes?

227
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,820
It was right…

228
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,380
You have chance to have avoided it.

229
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,070
But the next time you will not be also lucky!

230
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,610
Chopper, take care of Nami-san.

231
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,360
Included/understood!

232
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,200
Sanji-kun, is careful.

233
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,670
Yes, rams Me! You do not have with you to make some for me!

234
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,360
In fact I worried for that.

235
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,130
Oh, that?

236
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,440
It… it is démoniaque…

237
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,720
Y does not have to be done some.

238
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,380
Not a trace of dust will not soil these bags.

239
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,730
This Mayor seems really to be a horrible type.

240
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,130
To impose taxes for all and anything…

241
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,870
Why is necessary that there is this rotten tax for the large dishes!?

242
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,320
I excuse myself…

243
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,320
Hein?

244
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,660
Near you.

245
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,720
Why you excuse yourself, Ossan?

246
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,050
You ace not heard what the type of presently did say to us?

247
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,910
Nan, not a mot.

248
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,940
Listen!

249
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,490
It makes party of these official robbers!

250
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,570
Because of its odd project, the taxes of everyone are wasted.

251
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,300
Es you able to include/understand that?

252
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,740
Nan, nothing the whole.

253
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,700
Be really long for you with the Luffy relaxation!

254
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,370
Does He, what it occur here?

255
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,750
A galleon appeared suddenly in the port.

256
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,730
A galleon?

257
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,550
It is not possible!

258
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,580
Ca with the cool air! Allons-y!

259
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,730
He, wait one minute, Luffy!

260
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,350
OAU, it is immense!

261
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,220
It is rather old ship.

262
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,280
Tyrielshin!

263
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,820
Tyriel-

264
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,830
Q-qu - What… H-He, Ossan!

265
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,140
OAU! Impressing!

266
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,420
They is too cool!

267
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,370
It is so brilliant! If cool! I want it! I really want it!!

268
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,580
I knew that you would say that…

269
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,490
Rolling…

270
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,120
Useless!

271
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,140
Sanji!

272
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,960
My bags of races!

273
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,060
It is insane…

274
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,440
I was sure to have avoided it…

275
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,540
It is you the insane one.

276
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,090
Sanji, it is metal!

277
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,620
Metal conducts electricity! Balance all that you have on you the metal one!

278
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,460
Not!!

279
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,460
Ca was expensive!

280
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,230
You know what I will do to you if you balance them!

281
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,420
But if somebody of normal had received as much electricity…

282
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,360
He would be already

283
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,750
It is not normal! He is well!

284
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,650
WHAT!?

285
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,130
They is not good.

286
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,610
None of my attacks goes…

287
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,960
He, it flees!

288
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,950
Wait!

289
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,140
Reik-sama!

290
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,820
It is our chance!

291
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,090
You had interest to keep my bags of races!

292
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,730
Yes, rams Me!

293
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,230
If they are so important, why YOU do not carry them?

294
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,160
Isn't Ca gone?

295
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:03,950
If…

296
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,150
Lapanui!

297
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,030
Isoka!

298
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,210
Longo!

299
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:09,990
Pukau!

300
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,970
Akibi!

301
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,140
The guy!

302
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,300
THE GUY!

303
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,440
He, Ossan!

304
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,760
GOMU GOMU NO!

305
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,830
ROCKET!!

306
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,950
Are arm!

307
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,740
Ossan, it is necessary that you give me this boat!

308
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,270
You… ate a fruit of the demon…

309
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,640
Me? I ate the fruit Gomu Gomu.

310
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,470
I am a man rubber!

311
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,200
This machine…

312
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,040
H-1 is something which I cannot give you.

313
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,750
Oh go, are not like that! Give it to me!

314
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,690
It is as if there were somebody it is not a long time.

315
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,430
But there is not a being on board.

316
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,090
This ship… left to the drift 50 years ago.

317
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,060
50 years!?

318
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,290
One would really not say.

319
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,260
Now, I am sure.

320
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,710
It is exactly in the same state as this day there.

321
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,530
He… About what you do speak, Ossan?

322
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,320
Q-what?

323
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,100
This signal…

324
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,660
The radar detected something!

325
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,430
I never saw such strong statements!

326
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,830
It is that the Rainbow of the Fogs?

327
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,160
Shit…

328
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,060
H-1 cannot leave so far…

329
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,380
What I must make…

330
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, of course!

331
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,690
I borrow that!

332
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,400
WHAT!?

333
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,250
Do not take our ship!

334
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,240
Why you do not take this galleon to go over there?

335
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,540
The bar of Tyrielshin is broken.

336
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,890
Whetton made it fly in glares.

337
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,150
D-of what you do speak, Ossan?

338
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,790
How do you know that?

339
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,510
50 years ago, I were on board Tyrielshin.

340
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,160
It disappeared!

341
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,330
Going Merry left!

342
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,490
He… It is what this brothel!?

343
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,060
These types, they had to confiscate it to cover the tax!

344
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,440
We do not have other choices only to excavate the port.

345
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,750
Shit! This dumb of Marimo is really useless!

346
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,280
He… One really will enter there inside!?

347
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,410
None the adventurers who entered there from it are come out!

348
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,350
One will enter.

349
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,440
I have continued my research during all my life while waiting for this day.

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,530
Are you afraid?

351
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,690
J-J I am not afraid!

352
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,070
I am more the great man on Large Line!

353
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,430
The Usopp Captain!

354
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,110
One enters the Rainbow of the Fogs!

355
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,560
Is professor, which this place?

356
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,950
It is Ape' S Concert.

357
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,810
Ape' S Concert!? Would this be…!?

358
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,050
What is it?

359
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,120
A place from where one will be able to never arise now that we entered there.

360
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,550
A cemetery of boats.

361
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,600
Q-QUOI!?

362
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,380
Ouaouououaouououa!

1
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:06,001
If you value your lives, return to the Blue Sea.

2
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,839
If you get any stupid ideas about trying to start something on this island...

3
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:14,802
Then we'll eliminate you like we will Enel!

4
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,305
Who were those guys?

5
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:31,986
Just fo using that one whistle blow he gave us for free, he fought this hard for us.

6
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:40,077
Well, pirates can't pass up a chance to steal some treasure.

7
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:44,248
And there's plenty of enemies out there. This is gonna be about survival.

8
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,128
Yosh!

9
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,880
Gold, here we come!

10
00:02:52,921 --> 00:03:00,097
EVE OF GOLD FESTIVAL!
AFFECTION OF VEARTH!

11
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,528
That beast is causing us some trouble.

12
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,864
We have to find some way to separate them.

13
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,451
Okay, I'm going in!

14
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:42,306
Two... Three attackers.

15
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:02,618
Laki!

16
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:05,329
What are you doing?

17
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,248
You're going to die if you just hang there.

18
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,879
Is this stuff worth dying over?

19
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,473
Laki!

20
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,021
Run, Kamakiri!

21
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,234
You saved my life, Kamakiri.

22
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:40,781
Kamakiri!

23
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,913
Wiper, kamakiri's down!

24
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:49,665
What'd you say!?

25
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,921
Damn it!

26
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,839
We're so close to victory!

27
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,009
Close to victory?

28
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:05,389
It will soon be night, and our advantage will only increase.

29
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:15,607
Help the injured!

30
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,692
We're moving out!

31
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,777
Retreat to the rendezvous island!

32
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,573
You think I'll let you escape?

33
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,409
Wait, Ohm.

34
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,120
Why should I?

35
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:31,665
God Enel has summoned us.

36
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:44,803
What's wrong?

37
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,391
It feels like the rumbling is getting farther away.

38
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,438
Yeah. The guerillas and Priests must be heading home for the night.

39
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,107
We should head back too, while it's still light,

40
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:59,318
W-Wait for me, Zoro!

41
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,111
Hurry up or I'll leave you behind.

42
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,031
YOU DON'T KNOW THE WAY BACK!

43
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:32,559
This is boring!

44
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,686
Who told you to stare at it?

45
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:39,107
Once the purified water collects in the dish in there, pour it into canteens.

46
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,026
That's all i asked.

47
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,696
We have to make sure everyone has enough water for tomorrow.

48
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,700
But...

49
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,869
Sanji, we got a lot of stuff!

50
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,329
Oh, thanks. I appreciate it.

51
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,413
What did you get?

52
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,832
Walnuts and aloe. Bananas and garlic.

53
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,000
Rats and frogs.

54
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,252
Yosh, toss it all in the stew!

55
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,380
Wait a second! Some of those ingredients were really gross!

56
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,634
Oh, silly me! How careless...

57
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,135
You don't like garlic?

58
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,929
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!

59
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,472
What didn't you mean?

60
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,265
Miss Navigator?

61
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,184
Wow, Robin!

62
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,895
What's that blue thing? A jewel?

63
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,063
Beautiful, isn't it?

64
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,356
But it's not what you think.

65
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:24,069
Hey, is that a salt crystal?

66
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,196
I found it beside the lake.

67
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,031
I thought it might come in handy.

68
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:32,953
Well of course! It's the key to life in a survival experience!~

69
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:37,165
I'll keep half the garlic and aloe.

70
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,678
I can make some burn medicine and disinfectant.
That should help the Knight of the Sky get better.

71
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,248
Need any frogs?

72
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:44,548
No, absolutly not...
Need any frogs?

73
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,757
Oi, hey, Zoro.

74
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:48,510
You're not doing anything. Gimme a hand.

75
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:55,642
Hey, my katana aren't supposed to be used like this...

76
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,521
Quit whining! Disobey the cook and you go without dinner!

77
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,735
What!? We're gonna eat a rock!?

78
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,903
Is it good?

79
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,239
You don't eat it, This is Hot Rock Stew.

80
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,242
The heat from the rock helps to boil the Stew.

81
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,120
Stew's a great dish.

82
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,331
It keeps all the nutrients of the ingredients, so they don't go to waste.

83
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,457
I see.

84
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,236
Wow, so tonight...

85
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,836
Dont thik about it...


86
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:27,257
But, Sanji I'm hungry...

87
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,800
IT HASN'T BOILED YET!

88
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,430
Dindn't you just eat a whole skysharks!?

89
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,014
Well...

90
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,349
Yeah, that was an appetizer.

91
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,728
Jeez, what kind of stomach does he have?

92
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,979
It's beyond calculation.

93
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:46,651
What're you up to, Usopp?

94
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,445
It's almost dinnertime.

95
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:54,617
Yeah, I was just going to bring this wood over to the ship so i can repair it tomorrow.

96
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,910
And were you planning to swim across?

97
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,454
Huh? Yeah.

98
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,789
Those huge sharks are still lurking in there.

99
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,173
Repairs can wait 'til morning! Let's go eat dinner, Zoro!

100
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,676
Yeah, Whatever.

101
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,973
Yosh, it's finished!

102
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,809
Ladies first, understand?

103
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,435
Yeah.

104
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,146
Yosh, everyone take your seats!

105
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,648
I'll pass out the plates, so eat up before it gets cold.

106
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:30,570
Okay, guys! I'm gonna explain how we should plan to move tomorrow!

107
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,530
Hey, this looks good!

108
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,283
Everyone... Oh, thanks.

109
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,494
You can keep eating, but listen up!

110
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,829
Okay!

111
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:43,708
Alright! A heart-shaped carrot!

112
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,212
I appreciate it, Sanji!

113
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,423
Well?

114
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,552
Was my Stew of Love delicious?

115
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,470
Huh?

116
00:09:56,219 --> 00:10:04,187
Everyone ready? First off, let's review Norland's picture book.

117
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:08,066
But, a few years later, when he visited Jaya again,

118
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,401
The golden ruins had disappeared.

119
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,113
This stew is really good!

120
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,074
Hey, are you listening?

121
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,451
But, Nami-san, he started it!~

122
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,327
That Sky Island packed lunch was really good too!
But, Nami-san, he started it!~

123
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,747
That Sky Island packed lunch was really good too!

124
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,916
Let's move on.

125
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,252
That means, at some point during those few years,

126
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,588
Jaya broke apart, and this island was shot into the sky.

127
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,551
It was brought here by the Knock-Up Stream?

128
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,428
Yes, that's the only plausible explanation.

129
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,683
Cricket-san said that the explosions occur at different places on the ocean floor every time.

130
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,270
That thing was pretty big. Even an island would get blasted up.

131
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:52,318
But from the looks of it, this forest is completely different from the one we went through on Jaya.

132
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,739
That's probably due to the composition of the Sea Cloud and Island Cloud here.

133
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:02,829
The environement seems to abnormally affect the rate and degree of growth of the plants and animals.

134
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:07,166
If that't the case, it would explain how the forest had overtaken that civilisation.

135
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,377
Mellorine has failed.

136
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,503
That reminds me...

137
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,903
The Southbird who helped us out of the lake was THIS big!

138
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:17,927
Yeah i never see a bird this big...

139
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,054
But, what I want to know is...

140
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,474
Why would that huge Southbird save you?

141
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,144
Well, I don't know.

142
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,940
But all of the Southbirds were calling the Knight of the Sky, ''God''.

143
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:32,400
God!?

144
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,320
Then I should kick this Ossan's ass!?

145
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,072
OF COURSE NOT, YOU SCATTERBRAINED IDIOT!

146
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,617
Okay, that's enough! Settle down, scatterbrains!

147
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,576
There, see?

148
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,119
What's a scatterbrain!?

149
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:43,745
You are!

150
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,079
Anyway!

151
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,667
Does anyone recall what was written about the City of Gold in Norland's logbook?

152
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,252
I do! ''I saw gold!''

153
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,884
No shit, dumbass! If you're just gonna state the obvious, then keep your mouth shut!

154
00:11:54,884 --> 00:12:00,136
And then the stuff about the Southbirds...

155
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:04,599
There was a rather peculiar statement on the last page of the book.

156
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,685
The final words Norland wrote before he died.

157
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,605
''The skull's right eye is where I saw the gold.''

158
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,439
Exactly.

159
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,149
Look at these.

160
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,404
I put the map Robin picked up on Jaya over part the old Skypiea map.

161
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:24,369
It's a little rough, but if you bring the coasts of these two maps together...

162
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:26,621
Look at this.

163
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,873
This is the topography of Jaya, 400 years ago.

164
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,001
Wow, a skull!

165
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,503
It looks like a skull!

166
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:35,797
Well?

167
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,881
Cool!

168
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,800
That's brillant, Nami-san!

169
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,426
Yay! Yay!

170
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,513
So then, the skull's right eye...

171
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,099
Here...

172
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,908
Norland was referring to the island as a whole.

173
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:56,117
That's why we couldn't solve the mystery.

174
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,027
I see!

175
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,987
So that's why!

176
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:01,739
I get it.

177
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,034
TREASURE!!

178
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,954
All we have to do is head straight for that point.

179
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:13,084
We can't leave the ship unguarded, so tomorrow we'll split up into two teams.

180
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,295
No doubt about it.

181
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,674
There's a fortune in gold just waiting for us!

182
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:35,106
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

183
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:44,448
Wiper.

184
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,577
Genbou, how are Kamakiri's injuries?

185
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,286
Yeah...

186
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,622
He's being treated over there.

187
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,748
Is it bad?

188
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:54,250
Yeah.

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,336
I didn't think he'd be injured so easily.

190
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,379
It was Ohm.

191
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,881
A fearsome opponent indeed.

192
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,008
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,762
It was...

194
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,765
It was my fault!

195
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:21,310
Man, I'm stuffed!

196
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:24,396
There'll be gold tomorrow!

197
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,401
You think tomorrow'll be sunny again?

198
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,568
Sure! We're on top of the clouds.

199
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,237
It's getting late.

200
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,614
There's no need for the fire, so we should put it out.

201
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,825
We'll give away our location to our enemies.

202
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,661
What a stupid idea.

203
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:39,995
You hear that, Usopp?

204
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,705
Can you believe what she just said?

205
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:42,832
''Put out the fire.''

206
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:45,751
It can't be helped.

207
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,086
Don't be so hard on her.

208
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,130
Robin's a woman who has lived her entire life in darkness.

209
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,173
She just doesn't know.

210
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,260
What do you mean?

211
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,181
We're SUPPOSED to have a campfire!

212
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:05,062
It's human nature to have a campfire when camping, even if it costs us our lives!!

213
00:15:05,062 --> 00:15:07,523
You're the stupid ones!

214
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,568
Hey, that's enough fooling around!

215
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:14,280
You know how dangerous this forest is, right!?

216
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,114
Don't care!

217
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,408
There are Priests out there! And guerillas too!

218
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:21,745
And even without them, forests like this are still dangerous at night!

219
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:24,456
There's probably fierce beasts or monsters lurking out there!

220
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,791
Monsters!?

221
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,043
Sky Island scary... Sky Island scary...

222
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:29,295
Oi, Luffy!

223
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:32,464
Is this enough wood?

224
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,758
YOU GUYS ARE IN ON THIS TOO!?

225
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:37,219
Don't worry, Nami-san!

226
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:40,764
Wild animals are naturally afraid of fire.

227
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,433
Behind you! Behind you!

228
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,268
There's something there!

229
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:53,611
Oi, he's saying something.

230
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:54,570
Come translate, Chopper!

231
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,618
''You puny pests have been keeping us awake!''

232
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,878
''Go to sleep, you dumbass humans!''

233
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,171
WHAT WAS THAT!?

234
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,090
I didn't say it!

235
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:11,929
''Hey, you'd better not be trying to move in on our territory.''

236
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,057
No, we were forced to come here.

237
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,976
''This is our land!''

238
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,895
''You think you can just barge in and start a fire?''

239
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,480
Ah, sorry...

240
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,942
''Everything in this forest, from the trees to the weeds, is ours!''

241
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:32,449
I'm not giving up my treasure!

242
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:37,496
Hey, look! You pissed them off...

243
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,957
What do we do now!?

244
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,041
Me!?

245
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,920
''Shut up.''

246
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,591
''The whole lot of you couldn't take her on.''

247
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:53,637
''Babe, didn't know you had such a nice punch.''

248
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,889
''I like you.''

249
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,144
So things are under control?

250
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,395
Looks like it.

251
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,648
Then, let's have our campfire!

252
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,942
AYE!

253
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:14,491
Come aboard! Come aboard!

254
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,577
It's the Eve of Gold Festival!

255
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,791
What is this? It's good!

256
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,044
Did you guys make this juice?

257
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
It's delicious! I'll have some more!

258
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,470
OI!

259
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:42,353
What is this wonderful drink?

260
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,313
We're getting that treasure!!

261
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,314
GOLD!

262
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:46,273
GOLD!

263
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,489
Have they tamed the clouds as well?

264
00:17:55,197 --> 00:18:00,371
I know of no others who could cause such an uproar on Enel's land.

265
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,748
Oh, you're awake. Are you sure you should be moving already?

266
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,188
I had intented to help you,
but im such a bother.

267
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,545
You did plenty.

268
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:12,716
Thanks for saving Chopper, and our ship.

269
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,842
What?

270
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,928
I think there's some stew left.
Would you like some?

271
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,306
No, no, I appreciate it, but I think that I had best not.

272
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:23,936
Oh, the weird Ossan's awake!

273
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,896
Thanks a lot! Let's dance!

274
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,690
Let's dance, Knight of the Sky!

275
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,024
Aren't you the doctor!?

276
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,362
Hey, Ossan, how's Conis-chan?

277
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,029
Is she safe?

278
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:38,659
Yes, she and her father are at my house. You need not worry.

279
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,660
Really?

280
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,787
That's great! I was worried!

281
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,915
I'm glad they're both safe!

282
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,209
Yosh, let's throw Chopper!

283
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,127
Why?

284
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,062
I heard a little of what you were talking about before.

285
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,232
Did you say that this island used to be called Jaya?

286
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,108
Yes.

287
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:15,028
But I belive that you have yet to hear...

288
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:18,657
...how it came to be known as holy ground.

289
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:28,917
Having this is what caused your folly in battle!

290
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,920
Are you here just to get in our way, Laki!?

291
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,925
I have done something awful to kamakiri.

292
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:38,886
We're fighting the Priests.

293
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,780
If we lack key military strength, we'll never reach God's Shrine!

294
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,347
I know apologizing won't fix it!

295
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,183
I know apologizing won't fix it!

296
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,726
But please give that back!

297
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,978
That's Aisa's treasure!

298
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,105
I made her a promise!

299
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,799
I promised to bring her back some Vearth!

300
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,399
Forget it!

301
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,485
Forgive me! Don't throw it away!

302
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:58,822
Kamakiri...

303
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,741
What about your injuries...?

304
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:03,243
I can still fight.

305
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,456
You're right.

306
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,708
If there's any time to take out Upper yard, It's now.

307
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:18,133
In today's battle, the effects of Satori's absence were clear.

308
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:22,346
Tomorrow morning, we must attack again, Wiper!

309
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:36,026
For you Blue Sea dwellers, the earth here must seem natural.

310
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,778
Huh? Yeah, it does.

311
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,614
I see.

312
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:46,889
But this is something that does not naturally exist in the sky.

313
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:51,917
Island Cloud is able to support plant life. but unable to bear it.

314
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,253
Green plants and earth are not naturally found in the sky.

315
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:06,139
We call this Vearth.

316
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:13,647
The eternal yearning of all things living in the sky.

317
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:17,859
Once we take out Enel,

318
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,863
There will be no reason to yearn for a bag of Vearth.

319
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,075
You know it, Wiper.

320
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:34,001
Because we'll be returning to Shandia, our home from 400 years ago!

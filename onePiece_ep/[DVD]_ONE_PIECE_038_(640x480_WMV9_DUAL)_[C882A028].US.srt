1
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:35,922
LUFFY IN TROUBLE!
MERMEN VS LUFFY PIRATES!

2
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,722
What's going on?!

3
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,622
Which one's Arlong?

4
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:07,922
Arlong...

5
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,422
Arlong... That is my name...

6
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,722
Me I am Luffy...

7
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:16,922
Luffy...

8
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,422
And who are you?

9
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:20,922
PIRATE!

10
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,622
Oh! lt's him!

11
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:28,622
He's here!

12
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,022
The ni-chan who likes to take walks!

13
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:33,222
Not so fast there, you.

14
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:36,222
Where do you think you're going?

15
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:40,822
You got some explaining to do to us first, ni-chan.

16
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,120
C'mon, hey...
lf you don't stop...

17
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,330
GET OUT!

18
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,980
And what does a pirate want with me?

19
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,360
Who the hell are you?

20
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,310
Luffy !

21
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,880
Help-me...

22
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:53,846
DON'T YOU DARE MAKE MY NAVlGATOR CRY!

23
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:57,016
You bastard!

24
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:57,183
You bastard!

25
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:59,643
How dare you hit Arlong-san!

26
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,190
You weaklings stay out of this!

27
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,153
Honestly...

28
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:11,655
Bursting in alone like that...

29
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:14,283
lt's not like l'm going to lose even if I was alone.

30
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,618
Idiot.

31
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:18,454
Since when did I say I was worried about you?

32
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,166
I'm just telling you not to hog all the prey.

33
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:23,167
Oh, okay.

34
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:27,129
U...uh... l don't really mind,

35
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,089
if you hog them all...

36
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,717
That's some bravery you got there.

37
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,721
That's him! lt's that guy!

38
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:37,848
The unknown swordsman!

39
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,517
That's Roronoa Zoro.

40
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:42,269
As l thought, l knew it!

41
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:44,730
He's the one that tricked me!

42
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:49,527
He rode me... I mean, I gave him a ride...

43
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,278
Look, that long-nose!

44
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:56,909
Huh?! But Nami killed that guy!

45
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:58,410
He's alive...

46
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:59,787
Which means...

47
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,082
I knew it! l was right all along.

48
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,459
That woman's a traitor!

49
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,293
That woman's a traitor!

50
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,220
Hey, who are those guys?

51
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:17,972
Hold up.

52
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:22,393
He blew Arlong away?

53
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,894
Unbelievable!

54
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,065
That's not something a normal human can do!

55
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,400
Those guys...

56
00:06:30,442 --> 00:06:33,028
You still wanna fight?

57
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:33,863
If you guys join in, you'd just
make things worse for them.

58
00:06:33,863 --> 00:06:34,738
If you guys join in, you'd just
make things worse for them.

59
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:36,949
If you guys join in, you'd just
make things worse for them.

60
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:38,951
You'd just get in their way.

61
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:39,118
You'd just get in their way.

62
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:40,703
But, why are they fighting?

63
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,705
But, why are they fighting?

64
00:06:42,705 --> 00:06:45,166
What reason do they have to fight them?

65
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,750
A reason?

66
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,172
Nami-aneki was crying.

67
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,676
She risked her life.

68
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,803
Do we need any other reason?

69
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:04,310
Pirates, eh? l see.

70
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,311
So that's the relationship between you guys.

71
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,354
So that's the relationship between you guys.

72
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,108
I thought you were just Nami's victims.

73
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,109
But...

74
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,156
But what can four inferior beings possibly do?

75
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:20,326
You guys are idiots.

76
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,912
You think Arlong-san will waste
his time with the likes of you!?

77
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:23,996
He'll be enough for the job!

78
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:24,622
He'll be enough for the job!

79
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,468
Could it be?

80
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:38,385
It's coming...

81
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,261
That is...

82
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,768
Wha... Wha... What's going on?!

83
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:59,573
You guys can be his next meal!

84
00:07:59,573 --> 00:07:59,740
You guys can be his next meal!

85
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,368
Come out! Mohmoo!

86
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,085
It... lt's a monster!

87
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:14,922
The monster from the Grand Line
that crushed Gosa Village!

88
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:27,268
It's huge!

89
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:28,936
It's huge!

90
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:31,564
That's...

91
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,566
It's the sea bull, Mohmoo!

92
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:40,739
Oh, it's just him.

93
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,741
So he was a nakama of the mermen?

94
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,675
Hold on! Mohmoo!

95
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,135
Where do you think you're going?!

96
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:04,847
Hey! Wait! Wait, l tell you! Mohmoo!

97
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:07,600
Mohmoo...

98
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,435
What are you doing?

99
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:14,315
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

100
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:14,607
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

101
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:14,982
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

102
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:15,649
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

103
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:15,983
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

104
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:16,317
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

105
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:16,650
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

106
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:16,901
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

107
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:17,234
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

108
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:17,485
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

109
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:17,818
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

110
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:18,194
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

111
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:18,652
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

112
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:18,986
Well, if you wanna run away, I won't stop you...

113
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:21,197
Would I , Mohmoo?

114
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:21,655
Would I , Mohmoo?

115
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:22,781
Would I , Mohmoo?

116
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:33,417
It's coming!

117
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:33,667
Yeah! Get 'em! Follow Mohmoo!
It's coming!

118
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,504
Yeah! Get 'em! Follow Mohmoo!

119
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:42,510
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

120
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,177
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

121
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,807
I'll take care of him!

122
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,099
This is a waste of time!

123
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,736
What the hell is he gonna do?

124
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,489
l've got a bad feeling about this.

125
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:23,300
His arms stretched!?

126
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,721
He possesses the power of the Devil's Fruit!?

127
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:29,140
What?!

128
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:29,932
Who cares!

129
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,850
Let's go!

130
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,936
Oi! Run!

131
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,896
What? What's he gonna do!?

132
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,023
I dunno, but it's not gonna be pretty!

133
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,397
GOMU GOMU NO...

134
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:50,353
KAZAGURUMA!

135
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:22,276
I didn't come here to fight these guys!

136
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,279
The one l want to take down...

137
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:27,907
IS YOU!!

138
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:31,202
That's just perfect.

139
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:36,373
I was just thinking about how
I'd like to kill you now too.

140
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,793
That was dangerous, you idiot!

141
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:41,629
Did you want to kill us too?!

142
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,421
Huh?

143
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:48,360
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

144
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,367
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

145
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:35,875
Such destructive power...

146
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:40,421
It's unbelievable that a human who can
throw a monster like that even exists!

147
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:43,507
Is this battle of this world?

148
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:56,896
What the hell did you think you were doing?!

149
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:57,396
Huh?

150
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:00,316
How dare you do that to our crew!

151
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,195
Looks like we have to get our hands dirty now...

152
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:05,237
Looks like we have to get our hands dirty now...

153
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,991
I think we need to teach them the
difference between our species.

154
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,536
So, the main forces have finally shown themselves...

155
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:18,626
Arlong-san, please stay right where you are.

156
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,045
lf you fought out of rage,

157
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,715
Arlong Park would turn to dust.

158
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,389
We'll take care of them!

159
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,724
Yeah, do whatever you like.

160
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:37,561
Scary...

161
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:40,481
Hey, um... wait...

162
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,571
Looks like the octopus is up to something.

163
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:50,950
First, you boil the octopus in salt water, slice,

164
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,244
then flavor with olive oil and paprika.

165
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:55,140
It makes a great appetizer.

166
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,832
Um, wait, can you hear me out?

167
00:13:57,915 --> 00:13:58,749
Take this!

168
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,000
SHlKAI-ZERO!

169
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,203
TAKO-HACHI-BLACK!

170
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,552
You moron! Why didn't you dodge it?!

171
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:13,556
Aah!! I can't see!!

172
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,600
And to finish you off...

173
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,564
Hey! Luffy, run away!

174
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:24,525
Yeah, that's just the problem.

175
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,486
I can't seem to move...

176
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,156
Huh?

177
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:32,700
My feet won't come out!

178
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,495
Idiot! Didn't you stick 'em into
the ground in the first place!?

179
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:38,539
What was he thinking...

180
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:43,335
TAKO-HACHI-BLACK On the Rocks!

181
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,443
This is just great...

182
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:08,986
Ooo! Sanji!

183
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,821
Nice one! Nice one!

184
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:15,084
Looks like I ended up with a complete
moron for my captain.

185
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:16,702
We're on the same boat.

186
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,505
He's... Awesome!

187
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:23,626
Well, at least it's a hundred times better

188
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,295
than being with a low-life bunch that hurts a lady.

189
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,048
A lady?

190
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,220
You came here all the way here
for ''that kind'' of woman?

191
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,515
You guys make me laugh.

192
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,684
''That kind'' of woman?

193
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:42,896
Say that again, and I'll cook
you in a buttered frying pan.

194
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:46,360
Making you into a Meuniere, Fish-man!

195
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:54,240
But a pirate who fights by chivalry
can only be mediocre.

196
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:59,704
Why don't you see for yourself,
if my chivalry is mediocre?

197
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:03,249
l was raised by an unbeatable pirate.

198
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:11,132
Seems like you're really unfamiliar with
the superiority of the mermen race.

199
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:25,104
I still ain't getting free.

200
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:28,357
Not yet? Can't you pull 'em out yet?

201
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,152
Not yet.

202
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't think l can get out just by stretching.

203
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,280
Are you even trying?!

204
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,865
Are you even trying?!

205
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,533
Do you even want to free your legs?!

206
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:39,869
What are those two fooling around for?

207
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,788
This is Arlong Park for crying out loud.

208
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,498
I'll kill you!

209
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,792
Crap, Crap.. Come on, dammit, get 'em out!

210
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:48,169
We gotta get outta here!

211
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:51,756
Wait!

212
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:52,006
Hey, Octopus.

213
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:52,590
Hey, Octopus.

214
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:55,342
Those two are busy.

215
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,345
l'll be your opponent.

216
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,223
Nyu, Roronoa Zoro!

217
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:02,433
I almost forgot about you!

218
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,019
I almost forgot about you!

219
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,611
That's right! Then you also killed
some of my brethren!

220
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:16,113
l'm not interested in any of that old news.

221
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:19,700
Your reason for wanting me dead...

222
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,077
I don't care about it.

223
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:23,913
The situation's changed.

224
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:27,041
It's not you who want to kill us.

225
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,835
It's us who want to kill YOU!

226
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,053
Alright, Zoro...I'll let you have that octopus.

227
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:39,470
Nice.

228
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,640
Ahh! Luffy!!

229
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:43,524
Huh?

230
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,022
I'm back to where I started.

231
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,694
Bastard!

232
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:57,071
Goodbye...

233
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:01,325
Looks like you really want to be killed...

234
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:10,251
lsn't that the guy who saved Gen-san?

235
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,005
Aren't you guys from Cocoyashi Village?

236
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:21,095
Seeing that you have all these weapons,
I can assume you guys are rebelling?

237
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,250
You guys are all...

238
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,732
KAENBOSHI!

239
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:25,850
Usopp-aniki!

240
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:32,565
Your opponent, is ME!

241
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,403
lf you wanna die so badly, I'll kill you right now!!

242
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,366
What's with that guy?

243
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,412
He stands up to fight, and then he
runs away... He's a strange one.

244
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,333
Get back here, you long-nose!

245
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,586
Hey, same with your mouth!!

246
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,797
Why did these guys become pirates?

247
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,097
Same old, same old.

248
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:06,057
Move!

249
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,521
This is getting boring. l just can't stand watching.

250
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:12,646
Arlong-san, I thought we asked
you not to get violent here.

251
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:17,134
I'm not going to, I just thought
of an interesting game.

252
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:19,111
A game?

253
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,531
l'm gonna

254
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,117
DESTROY YOU!

255
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:29,997
Do you guys seriously think you can win against us?

256
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:31,957
So what about it?

257
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,251
Of course we think that, you idiot!

258
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:35,628
Let go of my hand!

259
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:37,546
Seems like he wants to say something.

260
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,768
Whoa! What the, what's going on?!

261
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,898
People who possess the power of
the Devil's Fruit are dead-weights!

262
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:58,693
Well, even if you didn't have those powers...

263
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,403
You'd still sink in this situation!

264
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:03,864
He can't be thinking.. into the sea?!

265
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:05,449
GOMU GOMU NO...

266
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:05,700
GOMU GOMU NO...

267
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,159
GOMU GOMU NO...

268
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:08,077
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

269
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:13,040
OUCH!!

270
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,250
ldiot!

271
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,753
Why you!

272
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,380
Useless.

273
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,469
Luffy!

274
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,679
Bastard!

275
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:37,973
l'm coming to save-!

276
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:38,315
Idiot! Don't get worked up!

277
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:39,567
Idiot! Don't get worked up!

278
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:42,653
If you jump in, you'll be right
where they want you to be!

279
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:46,657
The mermen have the upper hand underwater!

280
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:49,994
There's only one way to save Luffy.

281
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,331
Take care of these guys quickly
and then jump in the water?

282
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,751
Let's do it!

283
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:57,793
We don't have much time.

284
00:20:58,335 --> 00:20:58,419
Right!

285
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,713
How many seconds do you think he'll last?

286
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,465
That rubberman.

287
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:04,425
Ah, so this is the game you were talking about.

288
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:05,509
I see.

289
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:10,347
The fish is yours.

290
00:21:11,474 --> 00:21:13,225
You got the octopus.

291
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,333
I'm in troubIe.

292
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,085
I don't have any strength to move!

293
00:21:40,086 --> 00:21:40,836
Oh no!!

294
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:42,797
He can't do anything by himself like that!

295
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:44,799
Luffy-aniki is gonna die!

296
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:55,518
You can't even breathe underwater.

297
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:58,396
Humans are such inferior beings.

298
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:01,649
Come on!

299
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:03,401
I'm your opponent, you freakin' octopus!

300
00:22:08,072 --> 00:22:09,532
Game! A game!

301
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:10,199
I'll finish this up in 5 seconds...

302
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:11,742
I'll finish this up in 5 seconds...

303
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:14,120
No, 3 seconds.

304
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,122
Don't be in such a hurry!

305
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:18,868
No matter what happens,

306
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:21,335
you have no hope of living after this!

307
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:39,979
TAKO-HACHI-BLACK!

308
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,773
Hold on! Luffy!

309
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:52,950
I'M DOOMED!!

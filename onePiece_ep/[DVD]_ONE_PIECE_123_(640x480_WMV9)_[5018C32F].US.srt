1
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:13,300
Ca feels Croco!

2
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:13,300
Course towards the tomb of the royal family, Luffy!

3
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,850
What?

4
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,050
Will the place be the target of a bomb in 10 minutes?

5
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,600
Yes, the explosion is planned for 16:30!

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,540
16:30?

7
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,940
You were found, Princesse Vivi!

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,510
We will obtain a large promotion thanks to your death!

9
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,650
One leaves in front!

10
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,320
In front of!

11
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,820
10 minutes!

12
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,890
One arrives at the last limit!

13
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,960
The destiny of the country…

14
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,610
will be decided…

15
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,340
in 10 minutes!

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,890
It is out of the question that I let to you pass!

17
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,770
Release from my way!

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,940
Staff sergeant! This woman…

19
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,080
It is Nico Robin!

20
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,240
That made 20 years that there is a beautiful reward on its head!

21
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,690
My right hand spreads the dryness with all that it touches.

22
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,700
It was right.

23
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,770
He does not laugh with his right hand.

24
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,230
The garden was transformed into true desert.

25
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,600
Where it slipped by?

26
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,860
You pushed me with end once too.

27
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,160
Missed.

28
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,630
Once more,

29
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,270
you lost.

30
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,630
Luffy with the straw hat, which suitable death.

31
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,090
In 6 minutes, the place and its garden will be destroyed in an explosion.

32
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,620
Afflicted, but I am in a hurry.

33
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,570
You have only to remain here and celebrate…

34
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,280
the advent of the new King of the Country of Sand.

35
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,200
Well…

36
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,560
I must leave, now.

37
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,780
She said that the zone of the tomb was in the West from here.

38
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,480
WOA! It WAS LIMITING!

39
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,670
I believed that I was going to remain there!

40
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,210
This dumb…

41
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,480
He left.

42
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,910
I saw it to fly away by there.

43
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,560
You will not leave yourself there so easily!

44
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,830
Salt Croco!

45
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,420
West of the Palais Royal -
Zone of the Tomb (Royal Tomb)

46
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,380
Here the tomb of the royal family.

47
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,830
The place where the kings of the past sleep for eternity.

48
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,420
Where is the Ponéglyphe?

49
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,200
A secret staircase!

50
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,790
Ponéglyphe rests inside the underground room.

51
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,010
Nobody is supposed to know the existence of Ponéglyphe.

52
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,670
Do not underestimate the underworld.

53
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,310
Even as a sovereign of a nation member of the World Government,

54
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,980
you cannot say that you and they know all on all.

55
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,260
But I do not throw you the stone.

56
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,690
You undoubtedly did not think that there remains still somebody on ground able to read it.

57
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,750
You can read Ponéglyphe?

58
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,500
Yes.

59
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,970
Therefore Crocodile agree to cooperate with me.

60
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,780
It is as for this reason as it cannot kill me.

61
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,580
I believe that… the site of Pluto is engraved in Ponéglyphe of this country.

62
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,990
Am I wrong?

63
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,310
I do not know.

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,680
During generations, the royal family of Arabasta carried the load to protect it.

65
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,570
That does not mean anything more for us.

66
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,490
To protect?

67
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,980
Made me not laugh!

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,950
The place of Imperial mourning.

69
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,620
It rests beyond these doors.

70
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,560
You told truth.

71
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,780
I… will not let to you pass…

72
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,550
How much time will you have to make me front face be satisfied?

73
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,730
Nico… Robin…

74
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,380
I… will capture you…

75
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,440
Croco… dile!

76
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,320
It would be said that you fell on it.

77
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,870
Who would have believed that the Navy would continue me up to now, downtown?

78
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,920
What did it arrive at your Boss?

79
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,370
Did this coward of smoker leave the tail between the legs?

80
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,680
The dogs which flee to lick their wounds do not have any right to speak about Justice.

81
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,530
It is one of the rules of the sea.

82
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,610
You have to only turn over to your HQ of the Navy for there papoter of justice!

83
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,590
Crocodile!

84
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,430
Useless!

85
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,450
WHAT YOU INSANE?

86
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,640
According to you?

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,810
I try to put to me in the skin of Crocodile!

88
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,430
How that, I will be able to find from which the attack will come!

89
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,800
Close and seeks it! There are only 5 minutes!

90
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,070
Still 5 minutes!

91
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,360
In 5 minutes, a million people will die!

92
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,520
Quickly!

93
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,750
It is quickly necessary to find these bomb planters!

94
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,530
Chopper! Why you do not use your sense of smell to find them?

95
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,530
Impossible! The gunpowder odor downtown hiding place all the others!

96
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,950
Ah, Ben…

97
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,840
Try to feel the odor of bomb planters which would try to make jump the place!

98
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,030
AND It Of ODOR IS WHICH TYPE, CA??

99
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,850
How I would know it? Test!

100
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,450
A gun which draws a bomb whose diameter of the explosion is of 5 kilometers?

101
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,820
One minute!

102
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,340
A trick of the kind must be particularly large…

103
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,460
And to draw it with a gun…

104
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,840
it is necessary to be near the target.

105
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,150
Thus that must be beside the place!

106
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,590
Pas le time to make the turn!

107
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,440
Here is a short cut!

108
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,500
You saw something, Pell?

109
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,140
I checked the roofs of all the buildings in the neighborhoods of the place!

110
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,520
No sign of a gun.

111
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,800
Then it must be in one of these buildings!

112
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,530
I will check in each one of them!

113
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,310
Yes!

114
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,740
Straw hat!

115
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,260
By where it left?

116
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,290
The croco!

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,180
The place of the palate where the rebellion gathered…

118
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,470
will be destroyed by an explosion with exactly 16:30!

119
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
It should be prevented!

120
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,830
The life of million my subjects is concerned!

121
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,940
The dogs which flee to lick their wounds do not have any right to speak about Justice.

122
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,120
It is one of the rules of the sea.

123
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,070
You have to only turn over to your HQ of the Navy for there papoter of justice!

124
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,100
Say the-me!

125
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,380
Where it left, the croco?

126
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,540
Towards the zone of the tomb.

127
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,080
By there?

128
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,890
Thank you!

129
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,150
Which justice?

130
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,940
Which General headquarter of the Navy?

131
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,680
Hein?

132
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,440
I can move more…

133
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,800
It is odd…

134
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,320
I ate all this meat…

135
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,820
It is that a scratch.

136
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,840
Perhaps that I am tired a little.

137
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,820
What you seek is engraved here?

138
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,160
Oh, I see.

139
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,870
A secret staircase.

140
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,380
Still…

141
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,100
Still 4 minutes!

142
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,940
Are there others of them?

143
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,280
It is the only one which your country hides?

144
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,350
Disappointed?

145
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,410
I held my promise.

146
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,610
It is true.

147
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,040
Here is a place extremely adapted for the greatest secrecy of this country.

148
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,870
Even by using all my resources,

149
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,570
I was not able to find this place without knowing where it was.

150
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,530
Then here is Ponéglyphe, Nico Robin.

151
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,910
It was fast.

152
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,480
It is a quite curious artefact which we have there.

153
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,830
Were you able to decipher it?

154
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,730
Yes.

155
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,020
Perfect. Read the-me.

156
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,510
Ponéglyphe interests me.

157
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,140
Kahira falls to the hands from Arabasta.

158
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,090
This is Old Paradise, in year 239.

159
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,410
The dynasty Bitein de Taymar begins its reign.

160
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,350
The construction of the large Temple of Taph with Erumalu is finished.

161
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,450
The hero of Oltea, Mamudin…

162
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,800
Hey, hey, wait, wait!

163
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,820
It is that which we want to know?

164
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,740
I contrefous of the history of this country!

165
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,350
Say to me where, in this poor wretch country, the most alarming military power of the world is hiding place!

166
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,150
Where is Pluton?

167
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,910
It is not mentioned.

168
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,130
What?

169
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,560
Only the history of the country is engraved above.

170
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,550
You are sure?

171
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,360
Pluto…

172
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,060
It is not mentioned nowhere.

173
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,040
I see.

174
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,220
It is thus that.

175
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,740
Which damage…

176
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,670
You were an advantageous partner, but…

177
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,670
I decided to kill you!

178
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,970
Qu…

179
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,110
The pact that we concluded four years ago is now accomplished.

180
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,080
This day, you said to me…

181
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,910
that if I brought you until Ponéglyphe, you would reveal me the site of the weapon.

182
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,200
During your 4 last years with Baroque Works,

183
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,120
your intelligence and your commands were exemplary.

184
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,760
It was sufficient for me.

185
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,650
You were a useful woman that it was necessary to keep within reach.

186
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,840
And yet…

187
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,250
at the end, you reconsidered your word!

188
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,790
Ponéglyphe of this country does not contain any information concerning the site of Pluto!

189
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,270
Or…

190
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,040
even if it is registered here, you did not have any intention to say it to me?

191
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,290
However…

192
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,020
I do not feel any anger towards you.

193
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,320
Do you know why, Nico Robin?

194
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,060
Imbecile!

195
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,740
I have worked with you for 4 years!

196
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,880
I always knew that you would do that!

197
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,400
Water?!

198
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,340
I can wound you with a knife when you are wet!

199
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,640
It avoided it!

200
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,200
Where is…

201
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,880
I forgive you all, Nico Robin…

202
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,920
Because…

203
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,990
I never trusted anybody since the beginning!

204
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,940
Considering the reaction of Cobra, I am persuaded that Pluton exists indeed.

205
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,790
It only remains me to find it without the assistance of Ponéglyphe.

206
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,740
Once this country will be mien, that will be only one question of time.

207
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,620
What was it that?

208
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,960
It is too early for the explosion of the place.

209
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,630
It was you. What did you make?

210
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,330
What? Not large thing.

211
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,260
This underground room is…

212
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,630
protected by a mechanism causing its collapse if I actuate a very small pillar.

213
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,510
You will die both with me.

214
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,100
I swear it on my name, as 12th King of the Nefertari dynasty,

215
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,030
I will never leave you the Country of Sand.

216
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,550
Where is this?

217
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,120
There remain only 3 minutes!

218
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,780
An enough large bomb to make jump a 5 kilometers broad zone!

219
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,680
There are no so much places where it could be!

220
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,240
We sought so much!
Why didn't we find it?

221
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,240
An enough broad place to shelter a gun there…

222
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,860
Woa! A stray bullet!

223
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,670
A rather broad place!

224
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
It is not right, Kohza!

225
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,480
You ace not right to hide you here!

226
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,100
Leader, it is not right!!!

227
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,900
Yes!

228
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,140
It is inevitably there!

229
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,310
They is dangerous, species of moron!!

230
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,810
A rather broad place where nobody would check…

231
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,480
I am not a rebel, species of idiot!

232
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,240
Do not seek me, ball!

233
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,230
Good blood, they take to me for which?

234
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,770
Be not astonished when you will hear that…

235
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,640
Heu not, be surprised!

236
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,440
I am the infamous CAPITAAAIIN…

237
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,650
Oh, Vivi!

238
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,110
You ace found the bomb planters?

239
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,920
I know where they are!

240
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,050
They cannot be elsewhere!

241
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,220
What? For truth?

242
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:28,800
Well!

243
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,290
It left!

244
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,090
I will prevent the others.

245
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,580
Be sure for you of you?

246
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,540
I slept well!

247
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,670
Hein?

248
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,410
Ah yes!

249
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,130
My body did not answer any more…

250
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,870
Then I had a change of course and I had to make a nap.

251
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,120
And…

252
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,890
Now I feel better, therefore…

253
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,280
THE CROCO!

254
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,350
I GO HIM FAIRE SA CELEBRATES!

255
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,980
This hole…

256
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,530
it feels the croco!

257
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,880
Eh well, you one are crowned sovereign!

258
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,130
You had envisaged to carry out me here to bury me alive, here with you?

259
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,810
For your country?

260
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,380
But…

261
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,200
You cannot kill me!

262
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,680
If I transform all these rocks into sand, I will be able to escape!

263
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,260
You sacrificed your life for nothing, Cobra!

264
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,590
Still 3 minutes.

265
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,510
With the destruction of this tomb and the explosion on the place,

266
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,440
all those which are drawn up across my road will be exterminated in one moment!

267
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,000
And then,

268
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,400
this country will be mien!

269
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,430
CROCODILE!

270
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,850
OR YOU HIDE?

1
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,443
Ah! She's laughing.

2
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,953
They raised the price again?

3
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,208
Don't you think that's a little too high? Why you...

4
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,337
Next time the price is raised, I won't buy it, hear?

5
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,429
Geez, it's just a newspaper!

6
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,973
But if you get it all the time, it adds up!

7
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,098
But if you get it all the time, it adds up!

8
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,854
Well, you don't have to save up to buy
your village from Arlong anymore...

9
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,481
So why keep worrying about money?

10
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,649
Dummy! That's exactly why!

11
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,818
I don't have that obligation anymore,

12
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,236
so from now on, it's all for myself!

13
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,779
so from now on, it's all for myself!

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,322
I can't go around being some kind
of cheapskate pirate, can I?

15
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:36,698
I can't go around being some kind
of cheapskate pirate, can I?

16
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,242
I can't go around being some kind
of cheapskate pirate, can I?

17
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,119
Hey, keep it down!

18
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,539
I'm in the middle of formulating my
''Hissatsu Tabasco-Boshi'' here!

19
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,712
With this, if I shoot it into the enemy's eyes...

20
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,046
With this, if I shoot it into the enemy's eyes...

21
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:51,212
With this, if I shoot it into the enemy's eyes...

22
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,969
What? Come on, just one?

23
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,803
Never!

24
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,556
This is Nami-san's tangerine grove.

25
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,017
I won't allow you to lay a finger on it!

26
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,063
NAMI-SAN! THE SECURITY GUARD
OF LOVE IS ON DUTY!

27
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,190
Thank you, Sanji-kun.

28
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,735
She uses him like a tool, that dork Sanji.

29
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:20,325
What the hell? It's just one little tangerine!

30
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,576
Stingy Sanji.

31
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,078
I SAID NO!

32
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,290
Oh well, whatever. I'm in a good mood.

33
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,878
The world's in such chaos right now.

34
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,047
There was another coup-de-tat in Villa.

35
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,801
Hm? A flyer?

36
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:57,445
BOUNTY! STRAW-HAT
LUFFY BECOMES WORLD FAMOUS!

37
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:57,529
BOUNTY! STRAW-HAT
LUFFY BECOMES WORLD FAMOUS!

38
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:28,101
So, it seems to me, that what
you are saying is that they...

39
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,309
won't be defeated by simply
dispatching a military force.

40
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,477
Correct.

41
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,813
Since their formation,

42
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,734
and subsequent defeat of Captain Axe-Hand Morgan,

43
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,029
they have been quite active.

44
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,073
Clown Buggy, 15 million.

45
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,744
Pirate Fleet Leader Don Krieg, 17 million.

46
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,039
And Mermen Pirate Leader ''Saw
Nosed Arlong'' 20 million.

47
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,835
Keeping in mind that the average
bounty in East Blue is 3 million...

48
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,340
These are big-league pirates that
are worth over 10 million.

49
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,007
And he's taken them all out.

50
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,883
And he's taken them all out.

51
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,303
The initial price on his head will be $.30,000,000,

52
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,347
which is a record figure,

53
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,474
but a reasonable one.

54
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,643
It would be wisest to take care of them quickly.

55
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,229
To pluck this seed of evil before it takes root.

56
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,067
Absolutley.

57
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,548
Anyone who wants to run, do it now!

58
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,967
For there is no room for weakness,

59
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,804
here in this fortress of peace during the Pirate Age!

60
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,890
It is not a crime for civilians to be weak.

61
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,642
We are the heart of Justice!

62
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,144
If there is deadly evil upon the seas,

63
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:58,274
we, the Marines will exterminate it!

64
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,861
In the name of ABSOLUTE JUSTICE!

65
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,237
In the name of ABSOLUTE JUSTICE!

66
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,789
Oujousama!

67
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,918
Kaya-oujousama!

68
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,922
Oujousama!

69
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,590
What's the matter, Meri?

70
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:22,924
Please, look!

71
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,425
Please, look!

72
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,426
Please, look!

73
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,888
Usopp-san!

74
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:28,972
Usopp-san!

75
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,684
That back profile...

76
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,811
is definitely Usopp-san!

77
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,939
It does seem to be, yes...

78
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,869
Hey, you look a lot healthier today, Kaya.

79
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,538
What story should I tell you today?

80
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:53,580
What story should I tell you today?

81
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,876
Usopp-san is pursuing his dream...

82
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm studying to become a doctor,

83
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,305
so that I can help people.

84
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,350
My dream and Usopp-san's dream...

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,187
The day when they'll meet again
and become one will arrive someday.

86
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,287
I'm sure of it.

87
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,495
At last...

88
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,454
At last...

89
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,455
At last!

90
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,250
Luffy-san is moving on with his dream!

91
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm Luffy!

92
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,255
The man who's gonna become the Pirate King!

93
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,602
See yaa!

94
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,514
But...

95
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,684
The next time we meet, we may be enemies!

96
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,582
CAPTAIN!!

97
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:57,579
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

98
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:57,829
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

99
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,079
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

100
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,455
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

101
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:58,705
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

102
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,164
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

103
00:08:59,164 --> 00:08:59,706
The one who's gonna become the Pirate King is ME!

104
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,418
Seems like there's a lot of stupid dreams around.

105
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,547
I'll go for my own sake.

106
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,491
Hey! Old man...

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,194
You ever heard of All Blue?

108
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:29,444
You ever heard of All Blue?

109
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,280
For all this time...

110
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,491
I owe you a hell of a lot!

111
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,137
Check it out, we're WANTED!

112
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,099
Wanted... Dead or Alive...

113
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,226
$30,000,000?

114
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,812
$30,000,000 YEAH!

115
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,606
Check it out!

116
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,276
Even my back is famous now!
Damn, I've got it goin, on...

117
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,154
They don't have my picture,
yet they have Long-nose's?

118
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,659
Oi- where, where? I don't see you.

119
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,244
Seeeee?

120
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,163
It's just the back of your head.

121
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,915
It doesn't count.

122
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,417
Hey now don't be jealous!

123
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,626
Someday you could get one too,

124
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,004
and be famous like me, even
if you aren't the captain.

125
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,963
Really?

126
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,090
Well, if you work hard...

127
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,886
All right crew! We're goin, to the GRAND LINE!

128
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,470
All right crew! We're goin, to the GRAND LINE!

129
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,221
YAAAY!

130
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:38,680
YAAAY!
You guys...

131
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,305
You guys...

132
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,642
Once again you really don't understand
the seriousness of this situation!

133
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,354
Don't you see this means they're
coming for our heads?

134
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,356
After this...

135
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,693
I don't think we'll be able to lounge
about in East Blue anymore.

136
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,282
30 000 000 $

137
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,160
With a huge bounty like that even the
top Marines will be Iooking for us

138
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,872
And tough bounty hunters after the money.

139
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,167
From now on, we'II be in a whoIe new Ieague.

140
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,713
Let's Go! Let's Go! To The Grand Line!

141
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,592
Let's Go! Go! Go! Go! To The Grand Line!

142
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,187
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

143
00:11:29,998 --> 00:11:34,294
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

144
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,468
Crap.

145
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,887
Cheap wine tastes like shit.

146
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,186
How I miss the days when I used to sample
fine vintages, with lovely ladies...

147
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,116
One bad waiter ruined my whole life!

148
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:31,209
I was demoted from my high position of Captain,

149
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,755
Captain Fullbody!

150
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,049
What? You're so noisy.

151
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,468
Um. it's the new wanted list.

152
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,846
Yeah, whatever. Put it there.

153
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,099
Not like it'd have anything to do with us, anyway.

154
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,230
That face... I've seen that face somewhere before.

155
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,274
I've never seen that pirate flag before.

156
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:01,239
I am Boat Captain ''Iron Fist'' Fullbody!

157
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:01,489
l am Boat Captain ''Iron Fist'' Fullbody!

158
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,159
Who is your Captain?

159
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,688
I'm Luffy!

160
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,288
I'm Usopp!

161
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,750
The flag was made just a couple of days ago!

162
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,377
Oh yeah, I remember that time.

163
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:19,591
Yes! He's given me a chance to
escape this boring, lousy post!

164
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,969
That kid will be so easy to catch!

165
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,807
I'll use him to get my position back!

166
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,268
ALL HANDS!

167
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,822
MEN, WE'RE SETTING OFF!

168
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,701
Settin' off, um, where to?

169
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,037
Um... er...

170
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:51,915
Well, they should be near the sea restaurant...

171
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,458
OOH! Restaurant!?

172
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,085
Oh Boy! Yummy!
OOH! Restaurant!?

173
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,795
Oh Boy! Yummy!

174
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,213
Whoo-hoo!

175
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,589
No! I...

176
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,766
It's him!

177
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:14,604
Full stop! Hard to starboard, 180 !!

178
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,818
Are those pirates?

179
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,820
Using a scrapped military boat?

180
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,905
How wasteful, the Marines are.

181
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,116
Just throwing them away as scrap...

182
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,618
WE ARE NOT SCRAP!

183
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,662
Are you idiot's blind?

184
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:33,998
How could you forget Fullbody the ''Iron Fist''?

185
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,876
Ah! It's that Marine ossan!

186
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,129
Are you in trouble? Do you need us to save you?

187
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,589
Stop kidding around!

188
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,009
Destiny has placed you into my hands.

189
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,677
MONKEY D. LUFFY!

190
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,470
You are under arrest!

191
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,848
Cool! My picture looks good!

192
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,850
And the back of my head looks good, too!

193
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,103
DEAD OR ALIVE.

194
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,896
Dead or Alive.

195
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,648
LOAD CANNON!

196
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,278
They're so noisy!

197
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,112
What's going on?

198
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,158
What're they doing? Attacking us?

199
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,493
They're aiming right at us...

200
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,620
This is not goood!

201
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,582
Alright! Lemme at 'em, I'll bounce it right back!

202
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,625
Luffy, I'll handle it.

203
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,502
Right, right. You stand back.

204
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,587
W-w-why? Why?
Right, right. You stand back.

205
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,546
W-w-why? Why?
Don't get involved.

206
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,297
Don't get involved.

207
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,965
Hey, this way, this way...

208
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,633
Sink them.

209
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,309
Woooo, Awesome!!

210
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,394
No way, that's crazy!

211
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,398
What? It's been so frickin' noisy out there...

212
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,279
You shouldn't bug people trying to take a nap.

213
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,616
How many shots can you stand!?

214
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,700
Fire!

215
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,495
Er... not good.

216
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,746
Not good?

217
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,674
See? The cannon had a crack in it.

218
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,467
Yeah, that's definitely not good.

219
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,179
Listen, you brats!

220
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,807
Do not look down upon an
Ex-Captain of the Marines!

221
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,101
We'll defeat you in close combat.

222
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,894
Let's go, men!

223
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,356
I'll have your head!

224
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,654
GOMU GOMU NO...

225
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,254
How dare you interrupt a cook
in the middle of his work.

226
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,797
You frickin' jerk.

227
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,091
We're not serving soup today.

228
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,093
You wanna lick the deck?

229
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,139
Why is that waiter here!?

230
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,190
Huh? It's over already?

231
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,192
Hmph. He's all talk.

232
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,029
That guy's still a jackass.

233
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,407
You guys are so noisy!

234
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,493
Can't I get some peace and quiet to read?

235
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,995
NAMI-SAAAN!

236
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,122
THE FOOD IS READY!

237
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:19,414
Really? I'm starved!

238
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,249
Really? l'm starved!

239
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,169
Food! Food! Foo-food! Food!

240
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,302
Huh?

241
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,637
What the hell's that?

242
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:35,930
Huh?

243
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,224
Lemme see.

244
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,069
Hawk-eyes! What are you doing here?

245
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,612
Shut up.

246
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,530
I have no business with you.

247
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,532
Where are your superiors?

248
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,912
Camping on an island such as this...

249
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,830
He's much too casual.

250
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,920
Boooss!!

251
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,308
Hawk-eyes!

252
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,648
Yo, Hawk-eyes.

253
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,066
Long time no see.

254
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,319
I'm not feeling too good right now.

255
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,154
You come for a match?

256
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,242
I have no interest in challenging...

257
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,370
a one-armed man like yourself.

258
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,581
However, I came across some interesting pirates.

259
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,460
And it reminded me of something
you told me a long time ago.

260
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,296
A story about a small village,

261
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,424
and an amusing little kid...

262
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,467
No way...

263
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,685
So you've come, Luffy!

264
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,648
Well then, Hawk-eyes.

265
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,279
I can't let you go just like that.

266
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,078
So, Hawk-eyes!

267
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,205
C'mon, drink up! Drink, drink!

268
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,166
We're gonna party today!

269
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,501
You seem to have already done so.

270
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,587
Don't mind me. This is a time to celebrate!

271
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,505
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

272
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,633
CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!

273
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,138
I like it! PARTY! PARTY!

274
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,432
But, boss!

275
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:46,111
You just said you had a hangover
from drinkin' too much!!

276
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:49,257
Idiot, Don't ruin this good pleasure

277
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,857
Don't you think it is rather early?

278
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,941
Don't worry about it!

279
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,195
Let's get WASTED!

280
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,994
Hey, did you hear? There's a price on Luffy's head!

281
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,913
Whoo! Way to go!

282
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,083
Hah, this village might get known
for producing an infamous pirate.

283
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,417
Not bad!!

284
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,127
YOU FOOLS!

285
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,087
Stop all this racket!

286
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,380
S-Sonchou!

287
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,258
What's to be happy about a villain
coming from our town?!

288
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,677
A toast!

289
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,887
Yeah!

290
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,472
Geez...

291
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,890
Everyone's getting into it.

292
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,477
Look, Sonchou-san.

293
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,396
Luffy looks so happy.

294
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,564
A pirate is a pirate.

295
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,652
I'm gonna be a pirate!

296
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,531
But, that's his dream.

297
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,283
Are you worried?

298
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,828
A dream?

299
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,288
Or fate?

300
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,757
We're getting very close to the Grand Line.

301
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:02,470
The only way to get there, is to
go through 'Reverse Mountain'.

302
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,972
That's a pain in the ass.

303
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,433
Can't we just go straight there, from the sea?

304
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:07,559
Nope.

305
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,519
According to the old man's stories,

306
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,563
it's the only way to get into the Grand Line.

307
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:13,815
Why's that?

308
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,358
It's extremely dangerous.

309
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,193
That's why I asked! Why?

310
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,612
I don't know any more than that!

311
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,864
The reason is...

312
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,532
OK! I got it.

313
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,784
Let's go head-on through the front!

314
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,662
Are you even listening to me!?

315
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,873
Because, won't it be more interesting?

316
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,209
It'll definitely be more exciting that way!

317
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,378
Argh...

318
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:38,923
Trying to explain things to you is driving me insane!

319
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,426
But what's most important is,

320
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,595
we should stop at an island and buy some meat.

321
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,721
Meat, meat!

322
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,642
On this island, there is a famous city.

323
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,019
Loguetown.

324
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,687
Loguetown?

325
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,982
Are they famous for their meat?

326
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,943
It's also called, ''The Town of
the Beginning and the End.''

327
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,571
Or so I've heard.

328
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:06,701
It's the place where the Pirate
King, Gold Roger, was born.

329
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,870
And also the place where he was executed.

330
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,542
The city where the Pirate King died...

331
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,295
Wanna go?

332
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:19,589
Yeah. I want to see it.

333
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,342
The man who owned One Piece.

334
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,011
The man who had everything in the world.

335
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,181
The place where he was born and died...

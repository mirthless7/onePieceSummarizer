1
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,359
There is a frog which makes crawl

2
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,420
What?

3
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,799
Turn and looks at!

4
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,649
Really?

5
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,300
Oi, Luffy.

6
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,499
You believe really what this idiot of admiral said?

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,800
It is impossible that a frog which makes crawl exists!!!

8
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,499
This frog makes crawl!

9
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,299
Everyone, let us follow!

10
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,400
Aye!

11
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,300
There is a headlight why here?

12
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,000
There is somebody over there?

13
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,469
It flew.

14
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,760
Yosh! The frog stopped, stop it as long as we can it.

15
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,599
We are wedged on something.

16
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
It is what this sound?

17
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,939
Back, behind, turn of approximately 180 degrees.

18
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:11,860
The train sailing on the sea
The watery city Seven Toilets

19
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,199
It is what that?!

20
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Go quickly! Turn on the right, quickly!

21
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
It is what?

22
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
What is what it is that this scrap heap?

23
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
A boat?

24
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,050
Not!

25
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,700
It could not sail at sea with this form!

26
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Eh, Frog, leave from there! What is what you insane?

27
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,990
It had it?

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
This boat was raising smoke?

29
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,300
Pirates?

30
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,269
Gran' my! Gran' my! They are pirates!

31
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,940
What? Is Ish it true Chimney?

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,030
Yosh! Come with `ze den-den mushi~!

33
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,780
It is a problem, somebody left the building.

34
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,230
It will call of the assistance?

35
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,090
Hold, Gran' my!

36
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,410
Ah, hello?

37
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,690
Um… What is what it was? I forgot it…

38
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,370
A drunkard?!

39
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,170
It is a good snack with saké.

40
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,970
Wow, delicious!

41
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,569
I am Chimney…

42
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,390
Here my cat, Gombe…

43
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,330
And it is Kokoro, my grandmother.

44
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
You are not robbers of train, is not this step?

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,349
I am Luffy, that which will become the Lord of the pirates!!!

46
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,999
Really?

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,750
Ouais!

48
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,640
Which interesting man.

49
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,780
Is Eh Chimney, a bateau a vapor?

50
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,440
But, normally, it should not be able to sail with this form.

51
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,999
You never saw it front, not true?

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,539
It is the only place in the world where will find it to you…

53
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,660
This Umi Ressha, we call it Puffing Tom.

54
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,299
Puffing Tom?

55
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,360
He turns his pallets and advances thanks to the vapor, and travels along a way on the sea.

56
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,509
A way?

57
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,380
Ouais!

58
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,339
It transports passengers of island to island.

59
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,349
Using a way under water surface.

60
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,740
He traverses the same road each day.

61
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,040
He transports also postal boats and articles.

62
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,480
It is true, there is a way!

63
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,260
Then it advances there above?

64
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,469
Indeed.

65
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,199
It is dangerous to enter a sector with marks and signals!

66
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,920
You should put the signal on other side. We did not know anything on this subject!

67
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,730
Even with all this danger of which you speak, he would not realize any!!!

68
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,600
It was cruel, you struck it with force! It was OUR prey.

69
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,430
Euh? You speak about Yokozuna?

70
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,200
Yes, the frog which makes crawl?

71
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,310
Yokozuna will not die of that. It is the major problem of Shift Station…

72
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,560
He adores to test his force against Umi Ressha. He will return…

73
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,720
To test its force?

74
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,980
For this reason he did not flee. He has some in the belly.

75
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,200
Stop joking! He disturbs us!

76
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,059
The pilot was destroyed several times.
[Pilot:bar of front fixed at the engine.]

77
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,180
To each time it comes, it causes wrong to the customers!

78
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,740
Then it is as that which it is.

79
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,850
Yosh, I will not eat it! I do not eat people who are given thoroughly in what they make.

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,370
You should think like that in any event, it is a frog.

81
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,940
Then now, where do you want to go?

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,120
If you want to take Umi Ressha from here, it will take you along.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,700
“The city of the queen of Spring”, Holy Poplar…

84
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,500
“The city of the gourmet”, Pucchi…

85
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,270
“The city of the carnival”, San Faldo…

86
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,000
All these places are funny.

87
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,550
For the authorized people of the government, there is also another special route.

88
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,660
The island of the gourmet, Pucchi?

89
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,600
I see, it is from here the ossans not-populated islands came.

90
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,340
Yes, now that you mention it…

91
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,300
Ouais, let us go to the city of the gourmet.

92
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,450
Not question!

93
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,270
We have a boat, then we will not travel by the train…

94
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,790
We will follow the log poses.

95
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,830
Towards where it points?

96
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,499
In the East from here.

97
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,150
I see, then you move towards Water Seven?

98
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,610
The train comes from this island “Blue Station”.

99
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,990
It is a good place called “the watery city Water seven”

100
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,729
Seven toilets?

101
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,710
It is the best of all, a city filled with shipyards.

102
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,789
The engineers are best world there!

103
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,619
It is the principal supplier of the boats of the world government!

104
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,640
Impressing, isn't this?

105
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,770
Then there must be exceptional naval engineers too!

106
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,800
It is sure that there is! It is a difficult task for the best carpenters of the world.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,260
Usopp!

108
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,129
Yosh, it is decided!

109
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,199
We will go over there and will find we a carpenter for our crew there.

110
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,900
I see, I see…

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,410
Then, wait one moment!

112
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,100
I return!

113
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,499
What?

114
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,600
Wait…

115
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,950
Hold… it is a simple chart of the island and an invitation letter!

116
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,820
Give that to the man named Iceberg and ridges to repair your batea well…

117
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,710
Water Seven is a very vast city. Then do not lose you there!

118
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,940
It is super sympathetic Kokoro-san! You are very nice.

119
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,420
We will also return to the house to Water Seven, before a long time.

120
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,150
Ouais, it is right!

121
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,220
If we meet again, I will show you my preferred store!

122
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,030
Oh really… Then I hope that we will still meet…

123
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,090
The log installation takes one week to be reloaded in Water Seven. You will have time to see certain things.

124
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,190
Ok, thank you!

125
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,859
Yosh, everyone! Loans for the departure!

126
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,669
Ouais!

127
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,320
Well we leave, thank you for information Kokoro-san, Chimney!

128
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,990
Made attention!

129
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,390
Attention with people of the government!

130
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,450
Allons-y!

131
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,940
The city of the meat!

132
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,350
What are you listening?

133
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,820
Which good breeze.

134
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,640
Perhaps what will we arrive at Water Seven earlier?

135
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,590
I hope for it.

136
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,379
Luffy, leaves me the task seek a naval engineer.

137
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,599
I will find a tempting beautiful woman!

138
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,440
Baka, it is a naval engineer!

139
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,130
That must be a man as large as a mountain!

140
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,350
5 meters!

141
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,169
If it is so large, it will not be able to remain on the boat!

142
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,450
It is not serious, as long as it is qualified.

143
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,140
The question is:Does somebody among them want to go up well on a boat of pirates?

144
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,340
I cannot wait any more… We will have another Nakama!

145
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,269
We are lucky to be arrived at the station in first…

146
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,980
Because one has this chart now!

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,599
If we follow this chart and return visit to this person called Iceberg.

148
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,769
Not far from there…

149
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,730
I see…

150
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,250
I INCLUDE/UNDERSTAND NOTHING THERE!

151
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,999
This drawing is same style as Luffy.

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,149
5 meters

153
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,030
Good let us seek a guy like that!

154
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,280
If ever there exists, I leave!

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,820
Me also, if I could find a boat, I will leave at sea!

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,470
But it seems to have octopus blood, it will drive out me probably also sea!

157
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,620
About what speak?

158
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,000
You all, come here!

159
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,019
I will distribute the money for the week!

160
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,270
Really?! Waaah, me initially!

161
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,309
Which chance.

162
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,520
Oh, remains on line!

163
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,200
Go, on line!

164
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,665
What is what does not go, Usopp?

165
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:05,454
These plates of iron and these parts rafistolées

166
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:08,205
still in memory of our adventures.

167
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:13,045
When I think of the way in which they will be completely repaired, the emotion gains me.

168
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,725
I include/understand, but!

169
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,725
More especially as since we entered Grand line, Merry underwent large damage!

170
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:23,125
The platforms squeak and the hold flees…

171
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:27,065
If we leave it like that, they will be dangerous as well for us as for the boat.

172
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:30,224
Ouais, but now we have much money.

173
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:32,264
We can renovate still best!

174
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,935
We can also improve it.

175
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:36,064
Yosh, let us add some guns!

176
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,595
Ouais, let us add a bronze statue!

177
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:40,205
Is Oi, it well here?

178
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,695
There is an island, I see an ISLAND!!

179
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,434
Yosh, that everyone rows!

180
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,325
There is enough wind, do not spend our energy unnecessarily!

181
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:04,875
Marvellous.

182
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,295
Narcotic!

183
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,275
It is what Ca?!

184
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:27,335
What a énooooooorrme fountain of water!

185
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:31,054
It is large, surely an industrial island!

186
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:32,974
There is Umi Ressha!

187
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:35,825
Impressing! All this water.

188
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,625
From where is what all that comes?

189
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:44,905
Very interesting… from the fountain, water descends all the channels towards the sea!

190
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,234
Oh, do we have to make a race in this water slip?

191
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:53,115
A race?

192
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,494
Not question…

193
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:04,204
Aho, leaves it. Be stunned for you or what?
[Aho:idiot.]

194
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:05,265
Ah, it is true!

195
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,305
But what wants to say this number?

196
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,705
Where that?

197
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:13,164
On this wall?

198
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,015
Where it is.

199
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:17,624
It is probalement an entry for the large naval engineers of 5 meters!!!

200
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,895
Does Y' have some as much as that?

201
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:22,095
Isn't the thing in front of us, it is the station?

202
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,725
It indicates “Blue Station”.

203
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,024
Very well the port is.

204
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,625
It is not this road?

205
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,095
Oi, you all!

206
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:35,955
It is not good that the pirates enter by front.

207
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,325
Turn to the bottom of the alley, over there!

208
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:41,425
Haaai! Thank you!

209
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:50,274
Wow, Marvellous! A city on water!

210
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:54,455
Impressing! It is brilliant here, what a beautiful city!

211
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:07,265
But the city is flooded, the houses are in water!

212
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:11,645
Not, the city was built on ground!

213
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,465
Look at!

214
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:17,954
It is true, the pillars are built in height!!

215
00:15:17,955 --> 00:15:20,725
I see, therefore one calls that a “watery city”.

216
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:23,705
Oi, let us dispatch, and will visit this wonder!

217
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:30,415
Oh! Oh you, no pirate boat is authorized here!

218
00:15:30,835 --> 00:15:32,854
Why did you come here? You come to make a plundering?

219
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:35,434
Not, we want to repair our boat!

220
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,735
Do they ask normally if it is for a plundering?

221
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:42,625
Good, there is a course a little further, you can remain over there for the moment!

222
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,215
Haai!

223
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:45,904
Thank you.

224
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:47,274
Not yet!

225
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:49,705
If one cannot be helped, we are pirates!

226
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:54,024
Here would not be a sure place?

227
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:57,625
Although it is not a very pleasant place.

228
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:59,855
Yosh, raise the sail!

229
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,534
What is what you ridges?

230
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:13,895
Not, I just drew the cord!

231
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,395
It was unexpected…

232
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,785
Is Going Merry if damaged that?

233
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:26,425
But why the citizens fear don't pirates?

234
00:16:26,595 --> 00:16:29,504
It is probably that the pirates are also customers of the shipyards.

235
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:32,055
Cease speaking and fix this!

236
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,815
Perhaps that there are bodyguards rather strong!

237
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:36,985
To deal with strong pirates?

238
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:40,785
There must be in a city like this one.

239
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:44,074
Really, that will be made? They is not dangerous?

240
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:46,685
They are not dangerous, we are customers!

241
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,155
It is true!

242
00:16:48,185 --> 00:16:49,584
Yosh, one goes there!

243
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,475
Wait, Luffy and Usopp!

244
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,105
You can follow me!

245
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:58,835
Until where?

246
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:03,795
Initially we must find the man called Iceberg and give him the invitation of Kokoro-san.

247
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:07,225
We will count on him to repair the boat and…

248
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,845
We must find a place to exchange gold against money!

249
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:11,775
Of agreement.

250
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,905
Yosh, good allons-y!

251
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:16,375
The town of Seven Toilets!

252
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:18,675
We forget gold!

253
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:24,284
Zoro! Fix the good!

254
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:25,284
You leave just?!

255
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:28,085
Attention, Nami-swan!

256
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:31,495
Now, I lost my chance to go outside!

257
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,565
Let us leave all together later!

258
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,015
Really?

259
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,585
Are there bookstores?

260
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,345
Yes certainly.

261
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,935
Shouldn't we leave to the bureau de change initially?

262
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,325
Why? Let us leave to the shipyard!

263
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:50,965
Frankly, to carry all this gold returns to me nervous!

264
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,424
Is the value the same one if one changes gold into money?

265
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:58,714
Yes, we must pay attention with that if one would cross robbers by chance!

266
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,635
We are the robbers!

267
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,955
It is true. If we change this into money, we will transport it more easily!

268
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:07,774
It was a little hard!

269
00:18:07,775 --> 00:18:10,185
You say that because you want to even carry it you.

270
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,795
You will make it fall or will lose it to you!

271
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:14,924
It is what will occur! Because it is Luffy!

272
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:17,804
How is what does not go with you?! You do not rely on me?!

273
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,435
Not.

274
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:23,575
Ca makes too badly, I think that I will not recover there!

275
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:27,955
Is this the only entry of the city?

276
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:30,925
“Store of hiring of bulldozer”

277
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:31,915
What?

278
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,245
What let us can rent itself here?

279
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:35,595
Is C " what a “bulldozer”?

280
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:37,865
I do not know… a bulldog, perhaps?

281
00:18:38,945 --> 00:18:39,815
Not it is impossible!

282
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:42,494
Excuse me… Can I rent a bulldozer?

283
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,225
ASK WHAT It IS IN FIRST!

284
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,695
Welcome! Is a bulldozer, it Ca? How much be you?

285
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:49,625
Three.

286
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:51,525
Which type of bulldozer want?

287
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:54,304
The types are Yagara, Rabuka and King.

288
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:57,435
And well, two will yagaras should make the deal for three people.

289
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,374
Ah, treat the good!

290
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,395
It was a strange conversation!

291
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,504
Does summers you come here while using the log pose?

292
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:05,125
Ouais.

293
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,545
It is impressive of your share.

294
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:10,125
Good… you do not know anything about the bulldozers, not truth?

295
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:16,085
To make short, here is a bulldozer, Yagara bulldozer. They are used all around the city!

296
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:20,295
It is a kind of fish which swims the head out of water.

297
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:24,335
Here the city of water. There are more channels than of normal roads!

298
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:28,125
The bulldozers are essential for the inhabitants from here.

299
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,905
Even for the tourists!

300
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:33,004
Do these fish draw us?

301
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,665
No traction, we will be on their back!

302
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,605
It is like assembling a horse on the ground!

303
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:45,835
It flopée one there of fish over there, find in the comfortable ones.

304
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,455
Two will yagaras assembled bulldozers, that made 2.000 Beries

305
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:51,685
Ahh, kawaii.

306
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:54,255
A horse fish would be said! A horse fish would be said!

307
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:59,075
Dumb! What do you make, dumb?

308
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:03,085
He loves you. You can take that one.

309
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:11,465
Can they carry heavy things?

310
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:15,655
They are really strong. They can be employed for the removals!

311
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,304
It is a luggage? What is what there is inside?

312
00:20:18,305 --> 00:20:19,125
Gold.

313
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:23,305
Good, in other words, they is good!

314
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:23,964
Look at!

315
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,144
Aaah, gives me that!

316
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,075
IN YOUR DREAMS!

317
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,354
What a terrible viel man!

318
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,725
AND YOU, NÉGLIGEMMENT DOES NOT SHOW IT has OTHERS!

319
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:33,165
Why? It is not as Ci that came from everywhere!

320
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,035
Ca surprises me!

321
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:38,724
Good then… both Yagaras bulldozers will be to 100.000 Beries.

322
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,655
You increased the price, viel man!

323
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,844
Forgiveness… They is 500.000 Beries.

324
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:44,765
It IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE!

325
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,875
You updated to me!!!!

326
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,065
The guy, that cannot be too dangerous!

327
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:50,334
Hold, 2.000 Beries, it is that?

328
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:51,085
Thank you.

329
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:54,225
Is there a bureau de change not far from here?

330
00:20:54,405 --> 00:21:00,705
Yes there is one of them but with all this gold, they will not have enough money!

331
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:03,924
It would be better if you leave in the center the island naval construction.

332
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:06,045
The center of the island of naval construction?

333
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:07,655
It is what?

334
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,025
It is over there!

335
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:10,585
Take this!

336
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:11,615
A chart!

337
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:14,275
It will be useful, thank you!

338
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:17,214
Old man, are the shipyards over there too?

339
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:19,375
Yes, the best of the world!

340
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:23,744
Excel. We can go to the shipyard after having changed gold!

341
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:27,784
Yes, finally we will be able to repair Going Merry.

342
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:29,025
And to find an engineer naval, too.

343
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:31,514
I am impatient.

344
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:32,305
Then…

345
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:33,395
Let us go there…

346
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,125
Yosh! Go, Yagara!

347
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:40,725
Made attention!

348
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,625
Quickly with the shipyard!

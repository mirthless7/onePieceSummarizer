1
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,169
Another warrior went himself from there.

2
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,379
And then the damage of
earthquake…

3
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,620
Brothel!

4
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,559
You are only the pestiferous ones.

5
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,389
You must repurchase yourselves…
here and immediately!

6
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,309
He, you are mistaken!

7
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,680
He, wait!

8
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,739
Seto! Release from there!

9
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,350
What you make?!

10
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,690
The Shandia warriors whom I venerate…

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,860
have much more pride than that!

12
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,789
Kid…

13
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:38,720
The curse is raised!
Tears of the large warrior!!

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,510
When the sun starts its descent in the sky of the West and plunges again in the sea,

15
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,630
Lives of your men…

16
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,090
will be offered to the Gods.

17
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,550
Whore!

18
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,730
Which opportunity that of you
to find wedged in this crack.

19
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,719
That can be only the work of a god.

20
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,860
It is astonishing that you sharp still.

21
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,030
He raises the ground?

22
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,849
You for the ritual prepare!

23
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,340
Carry out the sacrifices on the Furnace bridge!

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,979
Can't He, one wait still a little?

25
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,309
The Admiral will return!

26
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,979
Leave him two hours more…
Not, an hour! Only an hour!

27
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,720
I do not want to be burned alive!

28
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,819
The sun lies down.

29
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,940
The ritual soon will start.

30
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,360
You are in sorry state.

31
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,330
This is the man who has
dared to defy a god?

32
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,159
Of what are you afraid?

33
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,720
How?

34
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,579
To tremble of fear in front of the unknown…

35
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,419
To sacrifice the life of people…

36
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,839
Ca comforts to you to do that?!

37
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,500
Comforts me?

38
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,870
To sacrifice a life does not have any direction!

39
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,259
Since hundreds of years,

40
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,139
we live thus!

41
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,929
That is not less true!

42
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:38,920
Silence!

43
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,220
Foreigner!

44
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,479
It does not matter the size of your gods,

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,890
lives of your similar
are crowned much!

46
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,569
The sacrifices are on the Furnace bridge!

47
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,850
They will be delivered to the Paradise
by the ritual of fire!

48
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,289
Admiral!

49
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,700
They will burn us!

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,080
To let die of the poor innocent…

51
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,790
I do not include/understand how you
can live with that on the conscience!

52
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,570
These barbarous acts are inhuman!

53
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,990
To live with that on the conscience?

54
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,620
Even if this woman of yesterday…

55
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,930
WAS MY OWN DAUGHTER?!

56
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,239
How can you?

57
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,600
You ordered with your characteristic
girl to give up the life?!

58
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,670
You and those of your species, you
will never include/understand the capacity…

59
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,400
words of a Priest,
witness of the word of God!

60
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,490
I must obey the laws of the village!

61
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,160
I cannot save it
because it is my daughter!

62
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,339
It is smaller than the other.

63
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,080
Would this be the son of the Kashi god?

64
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,750
It came to inflict the judgment to you for
to have made run the blood of a god!

65
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,430
Which judgment?

66
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,729
60 years ago, in my country,

67
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,309
the same epidemic as that
who decimates your village,

68
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,940
the Fever of the Trees, carried
100.000 people of my people!

69
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,950
But now, never nobody
any more this disease will not die!

70
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,980
You know why?!

71
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,150
We discovered a remedy!

72
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,990
I hold in my hand
right-hand side the bark of Cona!

73
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,630
We can extract the remedy,
the Hill, of this bark!

74
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,250
If we pay some,
your village will be saved!

75
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,300
You know how much people in
did world wait in vain for that?

76
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,809
How much people died
before it is discovered?!

77
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,970
You know?!

78
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,230
You reduce to nothing it
great step in progress!

79
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:18,320
And as I said it to you,
your ritual is ashamed!

80
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,320
Finally, I would be
judged or will I die?

81
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,060
Will I die in this accident?

82
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,940
With final, your village
will he perish of a curse?

83
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,900
Or of an epidemic?

84
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,540
YOUR GOD MAKES YOU IT IF FEAR?!!

85
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,490
I can hear them
words of a wise man.

86
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,790
Answer me!

87
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,920
What did I thus kill?

88
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,809
A snake.

89
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,410
Not!

90
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,230
I broke the laws
crowned and killed a god!

91
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,859
And you say to me that it
is only one snake?!

92
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,680
And that the epidemic of my village
is a curable disease?!

93
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,410
Can you really save
my invaluable village?!

94
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,610
Can the village be saved?

95
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,080
It can it!

96
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,760
Ah, a snake!

97
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,460
Look at to me that.

98
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,809
He, Karugara.

99
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,120
Look at that.

100
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,439
Which surprise.

101
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,350
This snake had also a grandson.

102
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,850
This snake?

103
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,210
A snake, hein?

104
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,289
Why they are marrent, these deux-là?

105
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,329
Whereas they were on the point
entretuer there is a few days,

106
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,829
the best friends of the world would be said.

107
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,660
Karugara is never
fact of friend in the village.

108
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,080
I never saw it laughing like that.

109
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,420
Follow me.

110
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,429
We will go down.

111
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,080
To go down?

112
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
The sound of a bell…

113
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,359
He, Karugara, are this
that this splendid sound…

114
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,940
You will see it whether you are to me.

115
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,390
Here they are!

116
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,219
Astonished, hein?

117
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,159
Here Shandora, the City of Gold.

118
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,320
We are them
survivors of this city.

119
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,900
The Gold City…

120
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,009
I have the impression to dream.

121
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,010
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

122
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,290
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

123
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,429
Ouah, there is gold everywhere!

124
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,760
This city is a treasure!

125
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,050
He, Ho… Stop, the guy.

126
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,059
They is good.

127
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,770
Put aside the belfry, you can take
all the gold which your boat can contain.

128
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,120
Seto, shows them where
the treasure is.

129
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,109
Of agreement!

130
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,569
You are sure?

131
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,119
The villagers are all of agreement.

132
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,330
We have a great debt towards
you to have saved to us plague.

133
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,450
I do not have anything to add.

134
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,919
They is so generous
of your share, Large Warrior!

135
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,710
But, you protected this
city during so a long time.

136
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,009
It is true.

137
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,299
We protected this city.

138
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,680
But it is not it
treasure which we protected.

139
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,460
What we really protected…

140
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,190
it is this stele.

141
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,730
What is it?

142
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,800
Writings?

143
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,810
One calls that the writing
history…

144
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,699
Ponéglyphe.

145
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,070
But we cannot read it.

146
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,620
It is not your
ancestors who wrote it?

147
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,040
All of which we are sure,
it is that this city, Shandora…

148
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,830
a war without mercy endured
in order to protect this stele.

149
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,550
We must continue to honor
affection that our ancestors carried to him.

150
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,840
They fought, and as descendants, we must honor the memory with their victory.

151
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,979
We venerate our ancestors
as much as our gods.

152
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,070
But I have evil to believe that this
bell can be also large.

153
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,109
The tinkling of this
bell is a message.

154
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,699
A message?

155
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,659
It allows the hearts our
ancestors who are with the Paradise…

156
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,750
to turn over on these grounds
when they wish it.

157
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,459
We sound this bell,
thus delivering these words:

158
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,950
“We are there.”

159
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,300
The tinkling of the bell represents
the last glory of Shandora.

160
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,839
It resounds beyond the seas.

161
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,130
Never we will ravel ourselves.

162
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,810
For this reason this bell, pride of
this city, is called the Flame of Shandora.

163
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,849
Indeed, the sound is splendid.

164
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,149
You find?

165
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,590
Of course!

166
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,570
This flame has us
guided to this island.

167
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,440
In the middle of a storm which
should have absorbed the sound,

168
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,280
I heard it
tinkling of this bell.

169
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,169
You also, you like to hear
this bell to sound?

170
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,840
Will you grow as much as this python?

171
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,920
Not before a hundred years then!

172
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,550
He, you are free to remain
as far as you will like it, Norland.

173
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,379
400 years were passed
since the fall of Shandora.

174
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,689
You are the first guests
that one receives on this island.

175
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,810
Profit fully!

176
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,109
Thank you.

177
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,899
I would wish to go in the forest,
to collect some samples of plants.

178
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,980
It is necessary to finish some for good
with the Fever of the Trees.

179
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,609
Admiral!

180
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,069
Admiral!

181
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,079
Are He, Ho, which this getup?

182
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,989
Look at, look at! Eternal Poses!

183
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,039
And a chart!

184
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,740
Admiral, it is a chart!

185
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,320
Last visitors them
left behind them.

186
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,740
Is this a chart of the island?

187
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes, this form of
cranium is well this island.

188
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,130
The name “Shandora” shows
the position of this city.

189
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,590
That means “the right eye of cranium”.

190
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,670
Then, made attention.

191
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,179
Take care to put back you well.

192
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,640
Thank you, Doctor!

193
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,899
He, that everyone gathers!

194
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,100
Norland will make us
to taste funny fruit!

195
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,239
There is a greenhouse on the boat.

196
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,940
We have the many ones there
different plants.

197
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,570
We will leave you some
seeds and growths to be planted.

198
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,489
Does this fruit have good taste?

199
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,079
Of course!

200
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,770
It is also very nutritive.

201
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,610
It is beautiful!

202
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,670
Ok, one has a gross
day in front of us!

203
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,879
Large day of what?

204
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,750
With drinking around a feu de camp?

205
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,140
Ouais!

206
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,439
Why?

207
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,100
Why friends of
did doctor do that?

208
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,109
Chief!

209
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,770
Norland and its crew are here!

210
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,569
Remember.

211
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,020
Do not speak with anybody about but it
happened last night!

212
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,440
They said that they would take
sea in a few days.

213
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,780
Reflect before speaking.

214
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,030
Never we will be able
us to include/understand!

215
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,169
It does not matter its medicine,

216
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,499
this man is only one killer of gods.

217
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,050
They of size are with
to ridicule our history?

218
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,089
That is enough.

219
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,180
Put side your feelings and
wait patiently until they leave.

220
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,290
They are there!

221
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,419
Hello, the guy!

222
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,120
Is Karugara there?

223
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,989
What is there? Why
does everyone leave?

224
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,179
Where is Karugara?

225
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,070
You, isn't this is foreigners?

226
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,159
Karugara said that it
did not want to see you.

227
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,210
Seto!

228
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,660
When do you leave?

229
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,960
It would be said that they us
hate of a blow.

230
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,049
He, wait a little!

231
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,679
You cannot
to decide on a blow of…

232
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,910
Enough!

233
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,760
Let us continue forwarding.

234
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,340
There remain zones of the forest
that we did not explore.

235
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,359
Was Karugara, you there?

236
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,069
Norland passed, and…

237
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,680
Yes, I do not want to see his face.

238
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,149
If I see his face,

239
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,770
I feel that I will kill it!

240
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,579
They did not sound
the Bell today.

241
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,539
Yes, but that is never
arrived since the beginning of the month.

242
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,670
Ouais.

243
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,419
Admiral.

244
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,509
In two days, we will have
explored all the forest.

245
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,290
Ouais…

246
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,679
Say to the crew…

247
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,469
that we take the sea in
three days. Prepare the voyage.

248
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,380
Say to them to benefit well from this country
before they are attached too much there.

249
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,140
Admiral, I believe well that they in
have enough of this austere island…

250
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,649
Not as much as we will not have
not accomplished our duty.

251
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,170
Will sleep.

252
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,939
You should install you here, Norland!

253
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,029
I know!

254
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,590
You should marry you with MUSE!

255
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,239
Anything!

256
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,949
My family awaits me in my country.

257
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,479
I have a kid of his age.

258
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,649
I must return.

259
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,480
Karugara said that it
did not want to see you.

260
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,340
When do you leave?

261
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,179
I know that you are there, Karugara!

262
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,910
Show yourself!

263
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,219
Didn't that last enough?

264
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,099
Say to me what it occurs!

265
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,639
I would not include/understand
if you do not say anything to me!

266
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,099
We soon will take again the sea!

267
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,510
I do not want only one
separates like that!

268
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,119
DOES NOT SHOW YOU!

269
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,700
You for you come repentance?!

270
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,410
Karugara!

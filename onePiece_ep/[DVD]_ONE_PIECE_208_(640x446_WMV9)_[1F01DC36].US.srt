00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:41,931
PIRATE FOXY
DAVY BACK FIGHT! !

2
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,391
One is there, one is there!

3
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,991
It is very empty!

4
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:01,390
It is not a giraffe.

5
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,190
In spite of his long neck, I believe that it is a horse.

6
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,658
A giant horse.

7
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,324
It occurred what?!

8
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,057
Look at…

9
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,991
When I broke the bamboo, a spirit appeared.

10
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,391
What is what they do?

11
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,990
WE ARE THE PIRATE FOXY!

12
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:33,191
Be not pressed, we want just a duel!

13
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:46,857
Come at home, I must thank you for your assistance.

14
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:47,857
Enter.

15
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:48,857
Yatta!

16
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,325
One will eat!

17
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,525
Ah, my good old dwelling.

18
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:58,925
In our village, it is habit to offer
the milk of our herd to our guests.

19
00:02:59,058 --> 00:02:59,990
A village?

20
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,657
Where is this village?

21
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,325
Which herd?

22
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,458
Why this question?

23
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,124
Ahh! The village disappeared! And the herd with!

24
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,524
What do you tell?

25
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,925
In spite of your absence 10 years, the village
did not can volitilize like that.

26
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:19,924
Not.

27
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:24,325
You put at ease, I will explain you then
all in connection with my village of nomad.

28
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,791
There must well be a little milk.

29
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:33,658
Milk you ace known as? Do not forget only that not made 10 years
to how be wedged you on stilts!

30
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,390
Do you want a little cheese in the place?

31
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,857
DO NOT CHANGE A SUBJECT!!

32
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:44,524
It IS TEN YEARS OLD MILK!!

33
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,991
It is not serious…

34
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,858
I will benefit from it all alone.

35
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,390
Hey! Does Ossan, it eat this cheese?

36
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,725
Do not do anything!

37
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,924
Of made you not.

38
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,124
This cheese is old only 10 years.

39
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,057
And contrary to you,

40
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:02,390
Me I knew many things in my life.

41
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:05,057
Then my stomach is different from yours.

42
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:09,191
I swear you, the young people nowadays are so fragile.

43
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:13,524
Call… a doctor…

44
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,924
YOU SEE I HAD SAID It to YOU! CRETIN!

45
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,524
A DOCTOR! A DOCTOR!

46
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,391
But it is me.

47
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:21,924
Indigestion.

48
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,391
WITHOUT JOKE?!

49
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,391
Ossan be too funny for you!

50
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,657
Nomads?

51
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:29,457
Indeed.

52
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:33,457
Regularly we travel from one place to the other.

53
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,925
Then,

54
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,924
during these ten years…

55
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,924
the villagers could migrate elsewhere.

56
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,857
This island is known under the name of “LongRing LongLand”

57
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,457
Welcome.

58
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,991
Ah thank you.

59
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:49,924
The provision of this island is in the shape of ring.

60
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:54,191
The high tide floods the places less
raised and the island in ten small others divides.

61
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:58,057
But one day per annum the low tide takes the changing.

62
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:03,925
What enables us to travel between each
part of the island, thanks to the emerged passages.

63
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:06,324
We use this day…

64
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:10,391
to travel from island to island every 3 years.

65
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:15,791
Thus you were left here during the crossing
other villagers, Ossan.

66
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,591
I like with what a not you are stupid, are the best for you!

67
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,590
If they change island every 3 years,

68
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:25,725
then that should take 30 years to them
so that they make a full rotation.

69
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,190
After being remained these 10 last
years on these stilts

70
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:32,590
You will as well as possible re-examine them only within 20 years.

71
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:34,390
Indeed, so only…

72
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:38,657
my chevaaaaaaaaal was still there.

73
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:41,724
I could each year have crossed an island…

74
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,724
And in 5 years, being joined together again with them.

75
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,991
A chevaaaaaaaaal?

76
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:48,190
Indeed.

77
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,524
It is the most beautiful animal of this island.

78
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:55,658
It is so beautiful when it gallops on the plains.

79
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:59,991
Without them one cannot reach the other islands.

80
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,790
If one tries to cross by oneself to foot…

81
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,324
while carrying all our businesses,

82
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:10,525
there would not be time to cross
before the return of the high tide.

83
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,724
Why not take a boat?

84
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:15,857
We do not know large thing with navigation.

85
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:21,658
Even if we use a Log Poses, it
would not point on the island nearest.

86
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:26,057
Because the 10 islands form only one of them.

87
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:28,990
There remain to me still 20 years to be waited.

88
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:30,124
You are sure?

89
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,725
You only will feel.

90
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,124
Wait…

91
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,125
Is a chevaaaaaal
the same thing as a horse?

92
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,457
Ah of course, a horse.

93
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,191
It y' has a horse well here.

94
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:47,990
Oh Shelly!

95
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,058
You awaited me?

96
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,124
Oh Shelly!

97
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,790
I missed you so much, you are adorable!

98
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,924
You missed me me too?

99
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,191
You awaited me since one crowned end of time.

100
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,057
Very soft, very soft.

101
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:01,857
You have…

102
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:05,325
You had to only feel you during all this time.

103
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,590
Thank you.

104
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,591
I will be left never again!

105
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:17,858
She says that she would like that you overlap it again.

106
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,857
I see…

107
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:36,524
The horse waited during all
this time the return of Ossan.

108
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,390
It is a faithful friend.

109
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,258
She must really be very attached to Ossan.

110
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:50,658
Super this horse is fast! I want to assemble it too!

111
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:53,725
She is splendid during her gallop!

112
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:58,725
Shelly, with the next low tide,
we will cross the sea together.

113
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,857
Sometimes it had to rain.

114
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:02,924
Other times it snowed.

115
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:06,058
And yet you awaited me.

116
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,524
Shelly.

117
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:18,924
You want to really await Tonjit-san?

118
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:21,125
All your friends will follow us.

119
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,590
Kora, wait!

120
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,457
You are really sure?

121
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,525
We will not return before 27 years.

122
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,725
In more one does not even know where Tonjit left.

123
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,657
You will find yourself all alone here.

124
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:38,458
Trust me, you should come with us.

125
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:42,791
Me also I will await the return of Grandfather.

126
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,124
Do not say anything!

127
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,258
I cannot leave a child
all alone, delivered here to itself.

128
00:08:47,258 --> 00:08:48,991
Nannnn!

129
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:52,857
Grandfather soon will return, I want to await it.

130
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:55,458
Would be happy Shelly.

131
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:58,258
SHELLY!

132
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:34,257
Hoy hoy Shelly!

133
00:09:34,258 --> 00:09:37,391
You know that I do not like too much to go quickly.

134
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,858
Ossan!

135
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:25,125
SHELLY!!

136
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,190
You are well?!

137
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,058
I heard a shooting!

138
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,390
Who could well send this net?!

139
00:10:37,391 --> 00:10:38,458
Ossan!
Who could well send this net?!

140
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,724
Now, this horse belongs to me.

141
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:45,990
It is true! It is the truth!

142
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,591
[Oyabi:Boss]
This horse belongs to Oyabi!

143
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,257
Bandage dumbs!

144
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:51,790
YOU ARE WHO?!!

145
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:56,591
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

146
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:06,125
MUGIWARA-TEAM

147
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,258
Bandage dumbs!

148
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,391
YOU SUMMERS WHICH?!!

149
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:12,392
Who I am?

150
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,592
It is not sympathetic that one.

151
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:22,125
You do not know who I am, band of cretins!

152
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,724
I do not recognize you at all!

153
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,858
I will pulverize you!

154
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,257
He does not know me…

155
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:31,057
Not Oyabi, do not worry you!

156
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:31,990
He lies.

157
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,590
He knows you, he makes right mine of the opposite.

158
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,992
No chance that he knows it.

159
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:39,058
Stop of you marrer, Hamburger!

160
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,657
My name is Foxy.

161
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:45,125
I obtain all that I want!

162
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,991
Remember of, band of cretins!

163
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:50,591
Why be irritated to you?

164
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,725
This horse is nothing more than one entertainment!

165
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:55,392
Dumb!

166
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,192
Await Luffy with the straw hat!

167
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,725
How you know my name?!

168
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:05,391
Of course that I know you.
I know all about you.

169
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,524
Your head is put at price to a total value of 100
million Berrys, Monkey D. Luffy.

170
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,458
60 million Berrys for Roronoa Zoro.

171
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:16,592
A crew of 7 members only with one setting has total price of 160 million Berrys, it is not nothing.

172
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:19,257
Us them Foxy Pirates,

173
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:23,391
let us defy the pirates of the Straw hat
with a match of DAVY BACK FIGHT!

174
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:25,191
But brothel about what you speak?!

175
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:28,592
Bring back your mug by here, if you want to fight!

176
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,457
Luffy…

177
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,924
wait a little…

178
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:35,992
Davy Back Fight… it is that, the ship of presently!

179
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,724
Where is the sail?!

180
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,657
I know anything of it!

181
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:41,924
That somebody brings back it!

182
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:42,924
The navigator!

183
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:44,124
One does not have any more!

184
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,191
Captain!

185
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,792
ONE DOES NOT HAVE any MORE!

186
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,057
Hey!

187
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,191
Luffy, this play…

188
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:53,257
Do not accept, you risks to lose your companions!

189
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:54,857
About what you speak, Ussop?!

190
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,058
I said it to you, not to accept his play!

191
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,257
Imbeciles!

192
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,657
What you have just heard is the truth,
Luffy with the straw hat!

193
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,324
It is too late I has just intended it to say
that it accepted my challenge! Not true Porch?

194
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:10,924
Yes Oyabi, I heard it me too!

195
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:14,325
You cannot move back any more now.

196
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:16,525
Ouais it is impossible.

197
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:21,391
Or would you be a coward who does not hold his word?

198
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,858
OF COURSE THAT NOT!

199
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:25,257
DO NOT FALL THE INSIDE!

200
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,458
But the horse!

201
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,658
Shelly…

202
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:31,925
Your knees are weakened too much, does not force too above!

203
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,057
Push you, the guy!

204
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:40,392
Ossan!

205
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:46,258
Shelly awaited me during 10 years,
how can you?

206
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,457
Calm yourself Papy!

207
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,525
They are pirates!

208
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,391
Davy Back Fight?

209
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:54,257
It is exact!

210
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:59,258
The play will begin when the captain from
each crew will accept the challenge.

211
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:02,257
In this moment even our captain
discusses with yours.

212
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,658
And he proposes in Monkey D. Luffy to play this play.

213
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:07,257
To propose?

214
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:11,458
About what do speak you? If you
please fight come in bottom.

215
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,724
Don't Hey you know what it is?

216
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:17,925
It is not a combat, the “Davy one
Back Fight " is a set of pirates.

217
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,058
It is well that.

218
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,257
It is an old play originating in the island of the pirates.

219
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:27,191
It is said that it is the legendary paradise of the pirates.

220
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:29,924
This play was used to reinforce its own crew…

221
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,725
While stealing the members of the crew of another pirate.

222
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,257
Pirates who fly of other pirates?

223
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:35,991
Yes.

224
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:39,257
I am surprised that pirates in
ever intended to speak!

225
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,524
Davy Back Fight is a battle
for the team members.

226
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:44,257
The winner of this challenge…

227
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,258
can choose the member who interests it
in the other crew.

228
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:53,125
And the team member must
allegiance with its new captain.

229
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,858
By swearing it in the name of Davy Jones.

230
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,291
If one fails… one a companion loses?

231
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,258
It is exactly that!

232
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,657
And if no team member interests the winner,

233
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:10,525
the heart of the ship represented by the flag
pirate is taken by the victorious captain!

234
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:14,591
One brings into play our companions and our pride.

235
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:16,724
If you gain your force will multiply…

236
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:19,324
and if you lose, there will be remained nothing any more.

237
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,191
It is a quite dangerous play.

238
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:21,991
Thus…

239
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:26,458
Perhaps that the crew of very with
the hour when all was disordered…

240
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,592
tried to play this play and found themselves without captain.

241
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:33,191
Then you met the Pirates of the crew with Kiba.

242
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:36,657
They played with us with the same play.

243
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:39,791
Look at that, now it
are our new companions!

244
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,592
Yes, Foxy Pirates lives!

245
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,991
I was the former captain of the ship in question.

246
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:46,991
Former doctor.

247
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,124
Former navigator.

248
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,524
Former naval engineer.

249
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:53,191
They lost in “Three Coins Range” with each recovery.

250
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:56,325
We also took their flag of pirate.

251
00:15:56,392 --> 00:16:00,525
That must make the 90ème time well that us
let us gain novel members, not truth?

252
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:05,391
They forced you to become their companion.

253
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:07,591
What returns to you so merry, band of cretins?

254
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,057
Indeed.

255
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,925
Now, the remainder of the crew
is stray right in the middle of the ocean.

256
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,925
Mislaid do you say?

257
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,792
I have any to only make!

258
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,324
It is not the sorrow to discuss.

259
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:21,592
One will never accept this kind of so absurd play!

260
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,791
Idiot!

261
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,124
It is not with the crew to choose.

262
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,191
In this play they are the captains who even decide them.

263
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,791
Cry and shouts as much as you want!

264
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,591
If your captain decides to accept this play.

265
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,258
then you all will be forced to take part in the play!

266
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,725
They are right Nami-san.

267
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:45,525
It is a law crowned in the world of the pirates.

268
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:49,458
Try to derogate from it and you will be dishonoured with life.

269
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,925
But what that can make us well?!

270
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:57,392
I prefer to die to lose my honor.

271
00:16:58,325 --> 00:16:59,724
It is similar for me.

272
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,925
Ca does not go the head both?!

273
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,324
Drop.

274
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,725
All the men are like that.

275
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,524
Well, then I will stop Luffy.

276
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,791
It is useless, you waste your time.

277
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,924
When the captains draw with the gun
at the same time, it is the signal of the beginning of the play.

278
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:17,525
Ca will not delay.

279
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,792
Ca wants to say…

280
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,924
Then it left.

281
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,925
It is all that I wanted.

282
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:29,857
Ca could be interesting.

283
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,324
THE PLAY WILL START!

284
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,992
Ouaiiiiiiiiis!

285
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:45,591
Idiot!

286
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:49,924
Why you accepted?! You do not know
not how much this play can be horrible!

287
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,924
But it is not serious if I do not lose!

288
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,124
Then you officially accepted the challenge?!

289
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,257
Ouais!

290
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,725
I go you botter the bottom!

291
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,591
One will see that!

292
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:02,591
I will do it!

293
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,257
Head of puzzle!

294
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:05,924
Head of puzzle…

295
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,391
Oyabi!

296
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,191
Hey! Why you ace say that?!

297
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:11,257
Oyabi is somebody of very fragile!

298
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,924
It is a sentimental person…

299
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,858
even if it does not have the air of it.

300
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:17,057
Without heart!

301
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:18,991
Stop of you marrer!

302
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,457
Luffy!

303
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,258
I know that you are furax by the way
of Ossan, just like me but…

304
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:26,257
One counts on you!

305
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:28,257
You cannot be raised also quickly!

306
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,858
I included/understood!

307
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:36,058
I will show you who I am!

308
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:45,658
Who wants bretzels?! There is also cheese,
cookies, quite tender meat!

309
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,257
And of the noodle bowls!

310
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,457
The play soon will start!

311
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,191
That everyone is calmed, calms itself, calms itself…

312
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:52,791
Your mouth! You make a headache!
That everyone is calmed, calms itself, calms itself…

313
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,324
That everyone is calmed, calms itself, calms itself…

314
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,324
Go, one counts all on you!

315
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,525
Crush them!

316
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,457
Wahh! It became super cool here!

317
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,791
They do all left the crew of head of puzzle?

318
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,925
It y' has some much…

319
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:08,125
Excuse me, could I have 2 noodle bowls?

320
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:10,058
Hey Ossan!

321
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:14,992
That all the crews gather,
in the calm one of course.

322
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,125
I will announce the rules of the challenge.

323
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:25,592
1, Any team member or lost flag
during a test of Davy Back Fight,

324
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:29,825
can be recovered only at the time of one
another test of Davy Back Fight.

325
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:33,191
2, All people chosen by the winner,

326
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:37,592
must immediately swear fidelity
with the captain of the opposing crew.

327
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:42,057
3, You will be able to use never again your
emblem once you lost it.

328
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,324
Nami-san, I bought barbe à papa.

329
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:48,125
The guy, how do you make to remain if slackened?

330
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:51,924
You are still worried by this play?

331
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:52,991
Here.

332
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:58,458
That which transgresses these rules will be humiliated forever, and will join Davy Jones with deepest of the ocean.

333
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,191
You swear to comply with these rules?

334
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:02,525
I swear it!

335
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,324
Now straw hat I let you choose…

336
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,191
A part…

337
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:13,124
Two parts…

338
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,057
Three parts…

339
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,057
Choose as much as you will want.

340
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:18,725
Oyabi, you are so generous to leave him the choice.

341
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,391
It is what that?

342
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:22,991
Ca relates to the number of tests.

343
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:27,724
You have the choice to carry out one to three tests.

344
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,458
Oyabi lets you choose.

345
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:33,124
The more it y' has tests, plus it is amusing.

346
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:33,991
Not true?

347
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,458
Luffy!

348
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:42,658
I included/understood!

349
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,325
Three parts!

350
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:51,724
AH! WHY You ACE VOTES WITH US?!
WHEREAS ONE IS ENEMY!

351
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,392
It is really an imbecile.

352
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:57,457
One will be entitled to the total challenge.

353
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,325
The “Three Corners Range”!

354
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:04,258
Davy Jones, you are pilot?!

355
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:12,325
It is which Davy Jones?

356
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:15,991
A pirate of formerly who was cursed and
who would still live at the ocean floor.

357
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,324
It is an old history.

358
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,657
One can live at the ocean floor?

359
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,124
It is what the legend says.

360
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:26,325
Its boat ran and all its treasure
rest with him at the ocean floor.

361
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:30,125
The ocean floor must be super alarming.

362
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,857
And all that runs in the sea belongs him.

363
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,524
It was called “Davy”.

364
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,990

365
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:42,125

366
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:45,724
You made your straw hat choice!

367
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:47,592
One will start!

368
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:51,858
Ouais it left!

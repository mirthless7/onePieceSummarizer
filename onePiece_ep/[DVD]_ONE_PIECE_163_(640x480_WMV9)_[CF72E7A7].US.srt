1
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,419
To save Nami on the way
and the remainder of the crew,

2
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,509
Luffy, Sanji and Usopp entered
the Forest Lost, on the island of God.

3
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,640
But they had to face the appalling one
Ordalie of the Bubbles of the Satori Priest.

4
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,439
Always in life, really?

5
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,199
Admirable! Admirable!

6
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,810
What you of a gift would say that
I especially reserved to you?

7
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,700
Meanwhile, Chopper remained only on
the Sacrificial Furnace bridge in order to keep the boat,

8
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,340
It is attacked by
Shura, one of the Priests.

9
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,410
Not!

10
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,530
Now, your life offers to God!

11
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,700
NOT… NOT QUESTION!

12
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,410
Die!

13
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,570
All my excuses for waiting.

14
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,330
Knight of the Sky!

15
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,020
You could with what await you while coming
here… It is you the criminal now!

16
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,760
Now, I will show you the power
of my anger vis-a-vis the bloody nuisances!

17
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,710
Ordalie of Wire!

18
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:35,860
A deep mystery! Ordalie
wire and Ordalie of the Love?!

19
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,859
Oh not!

20
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,260
Show yourself, my
Dragon-bubbles!

21
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,570
It is what that? It is right a heap of
your Clouds Surprised hung between them.

22
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,020
It is judicious to impress me?

23
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,479
Of course. But I go you
to entrust a small secrecy.

24
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,080
It is entirely made Surprised Bubbles
charged with explosives and filled with projectiles.

25
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,520
What?! You want to say that…?!

26
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,100
If you effleures would be this only one of
Explosive bubbles of his body, you are foutu!

27
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,480
A detonator would start one
series of explosions in chain…

28
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,310
thus causing gigantic
instantaneous explosion!

29
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,649
Chain Surprised Bubbles!

30
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,270
Ahead, Dragon-Bubbles!

31
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,090
GOMU GOMU NO GUN!

32
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,190
What?! He! Wait, Luffy!!

33
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,579
Do not touch with this trick!

34
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,739
If you it effleures with
, one pains is all died!

35
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,280
One would fly in glares!

36
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,999
How I make if I
donot can touch it?

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,959
I say to you that had you
not need to beat you.

38
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,180
All that one can do, it is to flee!

39
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,259
And to go where?!

40
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,290
What I know some?!

41
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,409
Oh, I know!

42
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,860
Jump!

43
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,640
What that fout there?!

44
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,710
You can never stop you.

45
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,390
No matter what one does, that
always returns to same!

46
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,929
Before you are not
completely exhausted,

47
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,190
I will make you taste with my
final bouquet of the Dragon of Bubbles.

48
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,150
You will not laugh!

49
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,910
Aisa!

50
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,950
Where were you?

51
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,920
Kamakiri!

52
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,199
Still in Upper Yard?

53
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,800
And your bag is filled with Vearth.

54
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,010
You should stop.

55
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
You risks to leave your skin there.

56
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,420
I do what I want!

57
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,650
Look at, are not even to you
able to beat Eneru!

58
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,580
Horrible little brat!

59
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,969
A chance?

60
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,539
Yes.

61
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,590
Gan Fall went on Upper
Yard for an unknown reason.

62
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,490
This old man persists in believing that it
can take again the control of the island.

63
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,520
Coarse error.

64
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:12,280
To overcome or perish, nobody can envisage
which will be the exit of a combat before the end.

65
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,840
Shandia (Warlike of Shandora) Wiper

66
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,909
Karugara, the Large one
Warrior, said one day…

67
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,900
“Let us revive the flame of Shandia!”

68
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,600
It is exactly it
that we will make.

69
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,840
That our enemy is Gan Fall, the old one
God, or God Eneru, that is equal for me.

70
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,950
It is the similar one with same, as long as one
so-called “God” will want to reign…

71
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,390
our cause will remain intact.

72
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,929
They deserve all to be eliminated!

73
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,290
Wiper.

74
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,619
People rebelled
against Eneru on Angel Island.

75
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,310
An young girl is in the beginning.

76
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,690
It is the first time since
beginning of its reign, six years ago.

77
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,739
And then?

78
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,340
Gan Fall saved it Judgment.

79
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,530
What means that Eneru found one
reason to judge former God himself.

80
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,610
As a Knight of the Sky
and even as a former God…

81
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,510
Gan Fall does not have us
ever carried reached.

82
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,240
And he never confronted himself with Eneru.

83
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,130
But this same man comes to
present to press the ground of Upper Yard.

84
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:25,410
Ca me gene not only it
will defy one of the Priests.

85
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,409
Unless you try to say to me…

86
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,590
that we would not have any more
to regard Gan Fall as an enemy?

87
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,040
To have a joint enemy
fact not of him our ally.

88
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,780
If that disturb you, then I do not want
of you on the battle field, Laki.

89
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
You would be only one ball!

90
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,090
Aisa.

91
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,200
What?! I was not
not on Upper Yard…!

92
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,490
It is not the moment
to enter the tipi.

93
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,630
Wiper, or rather the descendant of Large
Karugara warrior, is of bad mood.

94
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,890
Yes, it terrorizes me.

95
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,610
Still more than God.

96
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,880
… To help?

97
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,890
Us?

98
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,300
Yes, it is that.

99
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,950
We will do our better
to help them to escape.

100
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,459
I do not arrive at
to follow their movements.

101
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,750
It is incredible…

102
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,070
I lost enough time like
that with your childishness!

103
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,400
Peuh, always also ramollo!

104
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,400
It is what this combat?

105
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,070
The Celestial Judgment…

106
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,360
This girl was a idiot.

107
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,290
One never should
to irritate Eneru God…

108
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,830
Return us, please… God.

109
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,590
Be taken to you with the trap!

110
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,609
A problem, Gan Fall?!

111
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,020
Demon, which you made?!

112
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,200
Why? Why I
donot can move any more?

113
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,870
Deaths… do not have
not need for answers.

114
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,230
Ordalie of Wire, a deep mystery.

115
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,760
Upper Yard… You can enter there if you wish it, but the impregnable fortress of the Four Priests…

116
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,590
is well too large for
dead losses in your kind.

117
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,650
Eneru God…

118
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,330
is powerful and untouchable.

119
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,889
Yes.

120
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,029
The Crowned Earth will sing again.

121
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,530
One day, undoubtedly.

122
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,000
Knight…

123
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,730
Knight of the Sky!!!

124
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,850
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

125
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,860
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

126
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,469
I must save it! I must save it!

127
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,070
If not… Celestial Sharks
will devour the Knight of the Sky!

128
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,330
Peuh! Park with the ire of Eneru-sama!

129
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,640
But, to save it…

130
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,210
I cannot swim…

131
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,870
And Celestial Sharks
will eat me too me.

132
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,699
“Only one does not touch
hair of my companions. “

133
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,189
“Do not destroy the boat.”

134
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,110
“I do not want to die.”

135
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,150
Here is a difficult customer.

136
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,279
A small so capricious shit.

137
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,340
Ca returns to me furious.

138
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,520
Why you are so weak,
if you hold so much with the life?!

139
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,950
Shit!

140
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,399
It is what this Knight of the Sky?

141
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,839
He sat down on
divine throne of God?

142
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,380
It did not even arrive at
ankle of a Priest like me.

143
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,020
Knight of the Sky!!!

144
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,120
Are Peuh, you Zoan, not true?

145
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,550
You cannot swim, imbecile!

146
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,230
It is true that you are Zoan, you too.

147
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,080
They is rather unhappy.

148
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,370
You want to join your Master?

149
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,409
Brothel, which waste of time.

150
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,619
These weaklings really aggravated me.

151
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,909
So still this river did not have
basic, they would have a chance.

152
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,400
But damage, because it has one of them.

153
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,560
And now…

154
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,270
I wonder whether the fate of
three fugitive was regulated.

155
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,929
Is it if
extraordinary what that?

156
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,670
Yes! It is inconceivable which it
that is to say hidden under a so large tree.

157
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,660
The process of evolution of nature
and of civilization is reversed.

158
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,580
Mouais, in any case, if one does not find
a means of crossing this river…

159
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,990
one will be able to never explore
this forest entirely.

160
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,529
One is not likely to meet
God at this rate/rhythm.

161
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,740
This civilization did not know to predict
growth of the vegetation.

162
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,450
It is the first time that
I meet such a phenomenon.

163
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,529
He, Nami!

164
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,020
You see something of up there?!

165
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,230
The Field of God, Upper Yard…

166
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,889
He, I cause you! Say something!

167
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,880
You can see God?!

168
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,250
Perhaps it has
fact a discovery.

169
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,660
Would this island be…?

170
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,939
It is finished by it you, the guy.

171
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,360
But be not disappointed too much.

172
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,320
I am a Priest. You
will be able to never overcome me.

173
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,159
It is useless! I
died of jitter.

174
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,120
My heart will stop beating.

175
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,060
Your last chance
passed soon.

176
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,270
Your boat is already almost
arrived at the exit of the forest.

177
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,520
What means the end for you.

178
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:21,110
Unless flying away in the airs like birds, you will be able to never leave these places!

179
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,980
You will wander in this forest until
how the will to live leaves you!

180
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,780
You believe…

181
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,789
that one will let you do that?!

182
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,430
Of course!

183
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,260
Chain Surprised Bubbles!

184
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,429
Ball Dragon!

185
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,720
Oh, it is amusing!

186
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,699
Where is the Bubble-Detonator?

187
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,010
A simple contact and you will die
in a gigantic explosion!

188
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,639
Good. It is now or never.

189
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,099
I can still do it!

190
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,230
I leave it to you, Luffy!

191
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,089
Oh, you think of going up to
trees to escape to you?

192
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,779
How you make for
to see in my thoughts?!

193
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,080
Release me!

194
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,950
Co-how?!

195
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,480
Ah, I have measuring rod!

196
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,939
It used a string
to control it.

197
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,220
Then…

198
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,300
Here!

199
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,539
I cannot control any more
the Ball Dragon…

200
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,999
Do not play the impertinent ones with me!

201
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,240
Come by here!

202
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,500
Coward the other piece of string!

203
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,119
It is here!

204
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,729
I suspected it.

205
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,190
No doubt. It is the exit.

206
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,500
But good, why there
didn't I think earlier?

207
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,710
We fell the top
of a cliff while arriving…

208
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,040
it is logical that the exit
also find it in altitude.

209
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,650
If we can reach the exit,
can imports the road which we take.

210
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,609
I must make quickly!

211
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,679
This explosion had the air malicious.

212
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,070
I hope that they are well!

213
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,809
It passed near.

214
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,869
I do not return from there.

215
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,000
He sought with me
to explode with him.

216
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,149
Which shame… I miss
still of drive.

217
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,250
It had almost succeeded in turning over
situation in one moment and I was lost.

218
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,289
My Mantra was
destabilized by this shock.

219
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,530
It is quite true!

220
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,330
It passed near!

221
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,409
You are always in life?!

222
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,889
Not!

223
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,769
Release! Scrapings!

224
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,369
Te does not stick to me
how that, salts perverse!

225
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,169
Go! Brushes!

226
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,509
C-cretin! Moron!

227
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,389
Hold it, Luffy well!

228
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,830
Do not let this Bouboule escape!

229
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,459
You?!

230
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,739
Ah, Sanji! Be alive for you?

231
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,189
I AM HAS HALF DIED, THANK YOU HAS YOU!

232
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,200
PAY TO WHAT YOU DO!

233
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,560
Lastly, in short, Bouboule…

234
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,159
Do not stop you bathing us with
your Ordalie by-Ci, Ordalie by-there.

235
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,469
But to tell the truth, I have some
not retained a traitor mot.

236
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,080
But now, you will discover
Mega Ordalie Merdique Flying.

237
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,980
There are two fragile young ladies who
wait until I come to save them.

238
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,730
In other words, you can call that…

239
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,009
Ordalie of the Love!

240
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,280
It is as loony as the other!!!

241
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,740
Release me!

242
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,809
H-H-He
!

243
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,689
Shit!

244
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,519
Let leave to me!

245
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,279
Bandage cowards!

246
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,520
It is not right to attack to two!

247
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,640
You kidnapped our
friends without preventing…

248
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,040
fact of crying an adorable angel
and tried to assassinate it…

249
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,649
and you oses to treat us cowards?

250
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,339
Ouais, it is true.

251
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,940
It is quite beautiful to be able
to anticipate our movements and all…

252
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,820
But even if you can envisage them…

253
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,930
that is used for nothing the whole
if you cannot avoid them.

254
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,569
Have-stop, idiotic!

255
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,859
I am a Priest with the service of God!

256
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,199
Let leave to me! He!

257
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,879
You me listenings?!

258
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,310
To pass in addition to the Judgment of
Priests is a crime of Class 1!

259
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,869
You really think that you
leave yourself there after that?!

260
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,860
It will be a declaration of war
against God Very Powerful Eneru!

261
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,690
Firm your mouth! Your
bad breath escapes.

262
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,910
Look at how I rather succeeded one
good mignonnette seasoned with pepper…

263
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,559
It is necessary to tenderize
meat, with force…

264
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,570
Brutally.

265
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,030
To cut out of small pieces
without the least hesitation.

266
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,240
Because thus, all savor that it
contain releases itself from only one blow!

267
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,440
Moron! Stop!!!

268
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,789
Ah, stops! Stop!

269
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,100
That will hurt! Stop!

270
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,660
TO CRUSH!

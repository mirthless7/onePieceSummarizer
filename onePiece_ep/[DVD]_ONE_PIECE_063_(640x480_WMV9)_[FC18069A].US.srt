1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,050
The promise of a man!

2
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,050
Luffy and the whale makes wish meet again

3
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,630
Laboon is not an ordinary whale.

4
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,460
It is a whale which has a heart like a person.

5
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,260
There is a reason why Laboon continuous to knock Red Line of its head,

6
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,650
and why it deals with Reverse Mountain while shouting.

7
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,560
I will tell you…

8
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,620
history of Laboon.

9
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,370
I dealt with the headlight as usual this day…

10
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,240
when a group of pirates is descended from Mountain Reverse towards Grand Line.

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,070
There was a young whale which swam beside their boat.

12
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,320
This whale it was Laboon.

13
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,740
Whales of the islands as it populate only West Blue.

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,780
It is the greatest species of whale of the world.

15
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,390
Apparently, Laboon travelled with these pirates since one good moment already,

16
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,510
but they travelled maintaining towards the dangers of Large Line.

17
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,690
They thought of having left it in West Blue,

18
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,500
but Laboon had followed them.

19
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,320
The whales of the islands swim normally in group with their companions.

20
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,610
But for Laboon, these pirates were his/her companions.

21
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,440
They dropped anchor in this course during a few months to repair their boat.

22
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,040
I became myself their friend at the end of one moment.

23
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,930
But the day when they were ready to leave…

24
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,240
I have a favor to ask you.

25
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,050
Could you deal with it during 2 or 3 years?

26
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,080
We will sail around the world and we will return for it.

27
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,320
He Laboon, I have something to say to you.

28
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,250
We will return on Grand Line and will travel around the world.

29
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,820
But you must await us here.

30
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,460
It is a dangerous place,

31
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,610
thus we want that you remainders here in safety.

32
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,530
Do not look at me like that!

33
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,450
You ace not interest to forget us.

34
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,280
Even if we are not close to you,
we will remain your companions.

35
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Good, one goes there!

36
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,150
The guy, ahead!

37
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,960
Let us show them what one is worth!

38
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,640
Ouais!!

39
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,530
Laboon!

40
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,010
Laboon, await us here!

41
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
We will be of return before you realize there!

42
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,870
You can be sure about it!

43
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,610
It was 50 years ago.

44
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:05,880
50 years?

45
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,220
Did Laboon await these people during 50 years?

46
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,990
Then it is for that she shouts?

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,270
And what it knocks the wall to reach the other side?

48
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,040
Yes.

49
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,300
This drain is incredible.

50
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,340
I am surprised that it is always in life with such a tunnel inside.

51
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,820
Is it one of your pastimes?

52
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,910
It is my pastime of doctor.

53
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,640
Doctor?

54
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,020
I am doctor after all.

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,180
A long time ago,
I directed a private clinic here on the course.

56
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,630
I was even doctor on a boat
a few years ago.

57
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,900
Really?

58
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,650
Then, be the doctor of my boat!

59
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,900
Would not be stupid.

60
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,390
Compared with you the 5 young wolves,

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,680
I do not have any more the force to travel everywhere and do anything.

62
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,820
A doctor?

63
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,780
It is for that you live inside the whale.

64
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,580
And this is the result of your medical care.

65
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,500
It is that.

66
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,840
When they become also large,

67
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,170
it is possible no to look after them outside.

68
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,020
One goes there!

69
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,900
One is outside!

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
It is the true sky!

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,820
Wednesday miss,
what do you make?

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,720
But 50 years whole?

73
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,340
These foutus pirate made it wait a long time.

74
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,880
Cretin!

75
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,120
It is Grand Line, you know?

76
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,900
They died.

77
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,820
There is not to await them longer.

78
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,040
It is sure, it occurred 50 years.

79
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,280
That shows at which point this unexplored ocean is terrible.

80
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,470
How can you say such horrible things?

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,050
But nobody knows anything of it!

82
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,050
Perhaps they will return!

83
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,720
It is if beautiful story,

84
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,700
a whale which continues to believe in the promise of his/her companions…

85
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,400
Not true, old man?

86
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,140
Yes.

87
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,200
But the truth is crueler than you cannot imagine it.

88
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,980
All that was in their plan.

89
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,860
These men are flee

90
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,790
of Large Line?

91
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,800
Impossible…

92
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,490
Therefore, they gave up the whale?

93
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,990
They tried to leave Grand Line,

94
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,350
what means that they had to cross Calm Belt?

95
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,970
Even if by chance they are still in life,

96
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,130
they will never return here.

97
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,730
Seasons, climate,
marine currents and even winds,

98
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,830
all disappeared without apparent reason.

99
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,120
Usual logic is not respected on this ocean.

100
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,100
The terror of Large Line exceeds the weakness of the heart.

101
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,150
Then these dumbs without heart,

102
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,880
without any thought for their promise,

103
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,790
made their bag and left this ocean.

104
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,500
They gave up the whale,

105
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,800
and it awaited here their return during 50 years?

106
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,390
It is too cruel!

107
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,160
But if you knew it,
why have said anything to him?

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,140
Isn't this whale includes/understands the human language?

109
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,490
I said to him…

110
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,900
All…
but she refused to listen.

111
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,530
Laboon, listens to me!

112
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,960
They already left Grand Line!

113
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,720
I know that you were friendly,

114
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,250
and that you thought that they would never break their promise.

115
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,510
But… they will never return!

116
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,110
Laboon, listening what I say!

117
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,660
They…

118
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
I know that you do not want to hear it,

119
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,530
but you must accept it!

120
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,550
Laboon!

121
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,330
Laboon!

122
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,160
This night, Laboon dealt with Reverse Mountain and shouted for the first time,

123
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,720
and it started to launch out against Red Line.

124
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,880
It continues to believe that they will return on the other side of this wall.

125
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,310
She will not listen to the truth.

126
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,480
Which animal…

127
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,040
Even if there is no reason to wait…

128
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,660
If there were no reason to wait,
she would have listened to me.

129
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,990
She is afraid more than very to lose the reason which makes it wait.

130
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,490
Its house is in West Blue.

131
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,910
She cannot even return to her.

132
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,910
She wished

133
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,370
to only be the friend of the men whom it followed up to now.

134
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,260
You know…

135
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,000
She is in a sorry state.

136
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,580
But you were also betrayed, not?

137
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,010
It is not really any more your problem, not?

138
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,290
Look at the scars on its head!

139
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,600
If it continues to be knocked like that against the rocks,

140
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,720
she will die without any doubt.

141
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,040
We have strange bonds and that has lasted for 50 years.

142
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,250
I will not look at it committing suicide.

143
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,990
What will make this cretin?

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,710
One cannot leave it eyes one second!

145
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,910
It would be said that it will make climbing.

146
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,540
Ikebana = Art of the floral composition

147
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,990
It is isn't the mast?

148
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,330
Ouais.
It has just torn off it our boat.

149
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,650
It is our principal mast.

150
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,030
Stop breaking the boat!!

151
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
Does whore, why you ace do that???

152
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,690
He! Kid!

153
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,560
They is good!

154
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,800
He will not die even if he is made crush!

155
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,220
Hein? Moron!

156
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,560
With what he does play?

157
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,260
Luffy!

158
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,210
What do you make?

159
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,410
Equality!

160
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,830
I am rather strong, not?

161
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,870
You isn't wants to beat to me?

162
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,770
Our combat is not finished,

163
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,950
thus we will have to fight one day next.

164
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,410
Your companions perhaps died, 
but now I am your rival!

165
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,560
We will rebattrons ourselves one day next to know which both is strongest for us!

166
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,020
Once we will have traversed Grand Line,

167
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,640
I will return!

168
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,150
And then we will finish our combat!

169
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,330
Hmmm… Not badly!

170
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,110
Here our promise of combat!

171
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,660
Therefore, until I return,

172
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,990
you will not have any more to strike the wall and to erase the mark!

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,760
Where are the two different ones?

174
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,720
Two others?

175
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,770
Ah, the two odd ones.

176
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,320
They had to leave.

177
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,900
I wonder nevertheless where they passed…

178
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,170
Wednesday miss,

179
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,980
what does one make?

180
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,600
At all events, we should return and inform the Boss what did without.

181
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,780
The limiting duration of the mission already expired for a long time.

182
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,680
I is of agreement, it is nevertheless a dilemma
because we could pass for traitors.

183
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,710
Yes.

184
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,490
We do not have weapons,
thus let us prove our honesty,

185
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,420
and let us start again…

186
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,690
There are not the choice!

187
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,080
In this case one returns…

188
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,650
Hein? What?

189
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What…

190
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,750
What doesn't go?

191
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,240
Missing!

192
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,740
It is what that?

193
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,330
You lost the Log Poses?

194
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,960
A small delay, Wednesday Miss!

195
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,310
Without him, one cannot return on our premises.

196
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,510
If we remain…

197
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,090
Not! Not possible!

198
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,690
It is…

199
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,540
Oh not!

200
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,090
Unluckies!

201
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,480
We are too late!

202
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,520
Mr. 13!

203
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,970
Friday miss!

204
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,680
Wait,
one can explain you!

205
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,030
We were going all to pay to the Boss!!

206
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,080
All is ready! Let us start to plan our voyage in Grand Line.

207
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,080
Ah, I finally will cook you,

208
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,740
tuna-elephant with the blue scales!

209
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,690
Cretin of asshole!

210
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,700
To destroy our boat like that…

211
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,630
He! Zoro!

212
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,460
Bring back your bottom and helps me,
I am not the carpenter of the boat!

213
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,180
But what?

214
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,940
You are noisy!

215
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,750
What is there Nami-San?

216
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,080
If you want food, am not afraid!

217
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,960
Food…

218
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,170
The compass is broken!

219
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,370
It does not indicate any direction.

220
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,810
Oh, it rightly.

221
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,040
It makes that to turn.

222
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,650
He, it is funny!

223
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,320
You thus came here all the five without knowing what you did.

224
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,930
Which extreme silly thing.
Summers you come here to waste your lives?

225
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,630
Food?

226
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,680
It is to nourish you, ball!

227
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,380
I said it to you.

228
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,960
Usual logic does not take place to be in this ocean.

229
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,370
This compass is not broken.

230
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,350
Then, that would be a magnetic field?

231
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,440
It is that.

232
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,890
The islands of Large Line have many minerals

233
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,690
causing abnormal magnetic fields over all its length.

234
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,610
Moreover, the winds and the currents are particularly unstable here.

235
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,630
When one is navigator, one realizes at which point it is insurmountable.

236
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,290
You are right… we will run to our loss if we do not know the direction to be taken.

237
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,110
Delicious!

238
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,520
I did not know it!

239
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,300
With me the fault!

240
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,020
Doesn't He that go?
How will we make?

241
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,390
He, they is not bad!
They is super!

242
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,750
Stop species of cretin!!

243
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,480
You cannot remain quiet two seconds?

244
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,610
But they is really good,

245
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,530
this tuna-elephant with the blue scales.

246
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,680
To sail on Grand Line will be impossible,

247
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,990
if you do not have a Log Poses.

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,080
Does a Log Pose?

249
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,150
Ever intended to speak.

250
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,020
It is a single compass which memorizes a magnetic field.

251
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,660
A special compass?

252
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,060
Yes, it has a really particular form.

253
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,350
Like that?

254
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,990
Yes, like that.

255
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,320
If you do not have this Log Poses,

256
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,750
to sail on Grand Line will be impossible for you.

257
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,300
I include/understand.

258
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,900
But, wait one moment.

259
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,590
Luffy?

260
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,580
Why you have one of them, brothel?

261
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,940
The two odd ones left it on the boat.

262
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,090
Be sure for you?

263
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,520
Why you struck me?

264
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,150
I felt it well.

265
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,070
You felt it?

266
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,910
Thus it is a Log Poses.

267
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,370
There is no reference mark above.

268
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:27,680
The islands forming Grand line obey the rule created by the magnetic fields.

269
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,170
Thus to travel in the order of island to island,

270
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,470
the Log Installation must adapt to the magnetic field of each island to indicate the right direction.

271
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,400
The truth is that it is possible no to know your exact position about this ocean.

272
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,330
You are completely depend on the magnetic field memorized by your Log Poses.

273
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,260
You must initially choose one of the 7 magnetic fields which emanate from Mountain Reverse,

274
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,500
but without choosing the island from which you will leave.

275
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:56,830
Perhaps your road will cross the others in only one final road.

276
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,390
And the name of the island at the end of this road is…

277
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,310
Raftel.

278
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,030
The ultimate island of Large Line.

279
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,470
The only known person to have confirmed her existence is the Lord of the Pirates.

280
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,570
This island is legendary.

281
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,970
Raftel…

282
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,960
Therefore, that must be there!

283
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,920
One Part!

284
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,930
Who can say it because this legend is most known of all,

285
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,410
but not another heart did not reach this alive island.

286
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,020
We will see… when we are there!

287
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,430
I am more hungry!
On the way!

288
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,260
You very puffed out all alone?

289
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,160
Wahou! Even edges!

290
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,470
Does the Log Pose?

291
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,990
It is really invaluable.

292
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,570
Our destiny on this ocean rests on him.

293
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,370
Species of bastard of Gomu!

294
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,560
I wanted that Nami-San…

295
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,160
I wanted that Nami-San

296
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,570
in eats too!

297
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,840
Why you ace does that?

298
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,230
Prepare to die Gomu of…

299
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,120
Sanji-Kun?

300
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,610
Yes, Nami-San?

301
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,330
You two!!

302
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,510
Refresh yourself the ideas!!

303
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,380
He, wait.

304
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,780
It was really, really so important, isn't this?

305
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,150
Our invaluable… Log Poses…

306
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,730
You do not worry.
I have of them another which you can take.

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,970
I owe you that well to have saved Laboon.

308
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,450
He! I believed that I had died!

309
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,130
Allow me, my beautiful.

310
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,790
Ah! Thank you!

311
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,940
Which pretty time we have.

312
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,280
He!

313
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,490
I have a request.

314
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,540
Whiskey Peak?

315
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,070
Which odd name.

316
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,030
What is it?

317
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,580
It is the city where we live!

318
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,900
You do not have your own boat?

319
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,880
Unfortunately, it was destroyed.

320
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,700
Wouldn't that be too nice of our share, Mr. 9?

321
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,620
By considering that you want to kill this whale.

322
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,920
You are who with the Juste?

323
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,110
I am a king!

324
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,390
Liar.

325
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,500
We can nothing say!

326
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,340
We want to return…

327
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,720
We did not want to really make this kind of dirty works,

328
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,300
but understand that we must maintain a “secrecy”!

329
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,940
We can really nothing say to you!

330
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,570
We beg you to help us!

331
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,810
We will refund you your kindness!

332
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,190
Do not listen to them!

333
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,800
No matter what they say, they are only executors of dirty works.

334
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,100
The problem is that we broke this Log Poses and we do not have of it an other.

335
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,330
You are sure to want to come?

336
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,490
What? You broke it?

337
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,980
It was mine you know!!

338
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,660
You made us kneel in front of you whereas you cannot go nowhere?

339
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, but…

340
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,350
Crocus-San gives us another of them.

341
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,930
We beseech your immense kindness!

342
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,160
This pétasse had us by doing all to us to tell!

343
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,630
Well! You can come.

344
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,440
Is that called Whiskey Peak?

345
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,440
Allons-y!

346
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,810
We have just met them and you will bring them with us like that?

347
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,610
They is good.

348
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,520
Do not worry you about such details.

349
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,280
But for the place where you will have decided to go,

350
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,510
it will be the starting point here.

351
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,810
If one does not find, one will réessaiera!

352
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,810
I see.

353
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,850
Well, one goes there!

354
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,150
I made a promise with the whale.

355
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,730
Prepare we to leave.

356
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,160
But which are you?

357
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,120
Me?

358
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,060
I am

359
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,580
the man who will become the Lord of the Pirates!

360
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,680
Cretin of pirate.

361
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,180
All is ready!

362
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,190
Your Log should be good.

363
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,370
Did you direct it according to the chart?

364
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,780
It points on Whiskey Peak!

365
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,960
With more, old flowered man!

366
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,750
Thank you for the Log Poses!

367
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,550
Well! Now go ahead!

368
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,390
With more!

369
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,920
I will return, whale!

370
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,020
Let us sink towards Whiskey Peak!

371
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,590
All sails outside!!

372
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,210
YES!!

373
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,130

374
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,430
The small one has a little the same mysterious air as you…

375
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,950
Hein?

376
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,760
Roger…

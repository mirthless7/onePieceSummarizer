1
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,659
Collect these deux-là and
disappear from my sight!

2
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,680
While you are
still in life, weaklings!

3
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,100
The celestial island exists.

4
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Zoro!

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,050
Luffy!

6
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,690
This “New Era” of which they
speak, it is shit.

7
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,350
The time when pirates
dreamed is completed?

8
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,149
Hein?!

9
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,120
Oi!

10
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,650
PEOPLE…

11
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,890
DREAMS WILL ALWAYS HAVE!

12
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:49,570
The legendary family!
Norland the king of the liars

13
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,849
Zut.

14
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,810
Zut.

15
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,910
Zut.

16
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,019
Zut.

17
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,719
It…

18
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,450
macaque…

19
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,630
The boat is dilapidated even more…

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,909
It is true that the hull
is in a dirty state.

21
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,749
Would not be necessary to change it?

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,659
I AI NOT REQUEST YOUR OPINION, DUMB!

23
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,749
DUMB!

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,950
You remember how one
had this boat, not true?!

25
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,699
PAS VRAI?!

26
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,399
It is known, Usopp.

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,020
But that is used for nothing râler.

28
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,600
The Vogue-Merry is a member
of the crew him too.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,209
DUMB!

30
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:20,699
ENF! ENF!

31
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,199
Then, let us give it in
state all units!

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,029
INCLUDED/UNDERSTOOD!

33
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,029
Luffy… be to you really one…

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,400
COM! COM! INCLUDED/UNDERSTOOD!

35
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,500
Oups.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,549
… DUMB!!

37
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,449
YOU WANT TO REPAIR IT OR DESTROY IT?!

38
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,450
Ben, I want really to repair it…

39
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,639
Oh, still…

40
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,680
LUFFY!!

41
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,300
After our departure of Mock
Town, we took towards the East.

42
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,130
One should reach soon
this point of the chart.

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,499
And this type which one seeks…

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,499
Which is its name already?

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,649
Montblanc Cricket.

46
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,700
This man who speaks about dreams
saw here, it is well that?

47
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,890
IN-INCROYABLE!

48
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,449
It is its house?!

49
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,809
It is a palate!

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,600
This Montblanc Cricket is
super rich person, or what?!

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,599
Imbeciles, look at more attentively.

52
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,619
Isn't a dreamer?

53
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,700
It is right
slap-with-l'oeil.

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,090
How that?

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,359
It was that a decoration?!

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,059
WHAT?!

57
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,450
It has only one half of house.
The remainder it is patching up.

58
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
Then it is a skinflint.

59
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,350
Which kind of dreams it could well
to tell to be driven out of Mock Town?

60
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,730
I do not know the details, but…

61
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,500
It seems to have spoken about a gold mountain
being some share on the island of Jaya.

62
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,629
Gold?!

63
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,130
The hidden treasure of a pirate?!

64
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,350
Who knows.

65
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,950
GOLD!

66
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,349
DIG, CHOPPER!

67
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,399
One will find gold!

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,079
It is enough that I
digs to find some?

69
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,349
He only saw, without companions, hein?

70
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,229
Hello.

71
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,099
There is somebody?

72
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,480
HE, YOU WILL NOT RETURN?!

73
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,949
Hum?

74
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,039
Y' has anybody.

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,650
HELLO!

76
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,249
No the answer.

77
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,239
Wait, cretin!

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,250
And if this type were insane dangerous?

79
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,819
He, the guy!

80
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,100
He is not there!

81
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,100
Look at that…

82
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,500
A book of tales.

83
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,450
It does not have the very young air.

84
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,950
“Norland, the Liar”

85
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,129
It is a super title!

86
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,449
Ca sounds well!

87
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,279
“Norland, the Liar”?

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,679
You know, Sanji-kun?

89
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,900
However, it is a book
published in North Blue.

90
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,150
Ben, I was born in North Blue.

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,059
I had ever said it to you?

92
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,339
I did not know.

93
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,219
I thought that you were
originating in East, like us all.

94
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,269
I grew there.

95
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,349
Silence, Chopper!

96
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,680
What you insane, brothel?!

97
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:51,270
Usotuski Nourando (Norland, the Liar)

98
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,970
This history is very
celebrate in North.

99
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,090
It is that a tale for children, but it
appears that this Norland really existed.

100
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,140
It was once, it there
has very, very a long time…

101
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,000
Perhaps more than four centuries…

102
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,340
In a kingdom some share in the seas of
North, lived a man named Montblanc Norland.

103
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,649
Norland was an explorer
who liked to make the account…

104
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,830
so fantastic adventures, that
one believed in lies.

105
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,730
People of its village never knew
if he told the truth or if he lied.

106
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,700
One day, while returning of a forwarding,
Norland went to present his report/ratio to the King.

107
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,500
“I saw a gold mountain
on an island of the Large Sea. “

108
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,300
The courageous King, wanting
to see that of its eyes…

109
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,590
embarked for the Large Sea
accompanied by two thousand men.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,520
They faced enormous storms and
horrible monsters fought.

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,780
Only Norland, the King and a hundred
men arrived to the famous island.

112
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,770
But all that the King and his men
discovered was a simple jungle.

113
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,130
Norland was condemned to
died to have lied.

114
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,680
And here which were
its last words:

115
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,900
“I know! The gold mountain has
summer absorbed by the floods! “

116
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,200
The King and his subjects did not believe it.

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,550
Nobody any more would believe
Norland now.

118
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,080
But Norland continued to lie
to its last breath.

119
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,930
Tales of the North Sea,
“Norland, the Liar”.

120
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,350
This Montblanc Cricket is it
descendant of Montblanc Norland?

121
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,300
I often heard this
history when I was kid.

122
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,520
In North Blue, there is not
not a kid who escapes from it.

123
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,880
One comes from North Blue.
Obviously that it is known.

124
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,060
Always same the rengaine, “does not tell
lies if you do not want to finish like Norland! “

125
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,219
It is more and more amusing!

126
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,620
I would never have believed but Jaya
had been the theater of all that!

127
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,499
And the descendant of Norland, the Liar,

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,710
is four hundreds always there
years later, to seek gold.

129
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,450
All that to wash the name of sound
ancestor, died as a wretched liar.

130
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,510
What a family of damaged!

131
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:25,190
He thinks that some gold nuggets
will be able to repurchase four centuries of shame?!

132
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,830
Not but what a simpleton!

133
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,749
And thus the poor liar…

134
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,350
… died…

135
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,840
… without never becoming one
honest warrior of the seas.

136
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,429
DO NOT LOOK AT ME LIKE CA!

137
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,110
AND THIS DRAMATIC TONE DOES NOT ADD!

138
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,550
Luffy fell to water!

139
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,410
What you insane?!

140
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,080
WHO SUMMERS YOU?!

141
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,450
You are quite shameless of
to penetrate at the others like that?!

142
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,849
This end of sea is MY territory.

143
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,899
He, Usopp! Will seek Luffy!

144
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,399
OK!

145
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,350
You want gold, it is that?

146
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,550
YOU WILL BURST!

147
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,769
SANJI!

148
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,000
Sanji-kun!

149
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,090
No panic! It has me magnifying glass!

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,010
Have-await one second!

151
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,390
Cretin, that will learn to you
to have underestimated it.

152
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,579
Drop!

153
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,540
I occupy myself some!

154
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,439
He, but what you foutez?!

155
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
Y' had bubbles…

156
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,570
… at water surface!

157
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,080
I was observing them, and
then a sweet chestnut left water!

158
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,399
But makes some, the sweet chestnut,
it was an old man…!

159
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,550
And it drew me with the fleet…!

160
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,050
Papi!

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Bring to me of the cold towels!

162
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,970
Open all the windows!

163
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,449
Aeroembolism?

164
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,309
Is the old man sick?

165
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,949
Yes.

166
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,140
They are symptoms
that the plungers have sometimes.

167
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,200
It is only momentary.

168
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,350
The problem comes from decompression
when one goes back to surface…

169
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,550
… a gradient of pressure
develop and forms bubbles.

170
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:32,700
The nitrogen bubbles deform the veins and
the fabrics and block the blood-vessels.

171
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,490
Ouais, a dirty disease.

172
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:43,890
It had to plunge the every day without leaving time to these bubbles to dissolve in its organization.

173
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,300
But why?

174
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
I do not know…

175
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,530
But they is bad for its health.

176
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,060
In certain cases, aeroembolism…

177
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,820
can be fatal.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,349
Oh! If that it is not Masira!

179
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,219
Be alive for you?

180
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,699
Did Ben ouais, why?

181
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,959
Not, nothing.

182
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,299
You ace heard the shot, you too?

183
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,249
Yes, my brother!

184
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,109
He had to arrive something to the Boss!

185
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,390
Quickly! My heart is beating wildly!

186
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,200
BOSS, ALL IS WELL?!

187
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,599
THEY COME TO KILL US!

188
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,749
What you made here?!

189
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,939
What you made with our Boss?!

190
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,309
About what you do speak?

191
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,299
One deals with him. Brushes!

192
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,069
MORON!

193
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,319
You really think
that they will listen to you?!

194
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,759
They are mad monkeys!

195
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,349
Mad!

196
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,350
You do not see?!

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,259
These guys are formidable…

198
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,899
Let us flee by the windows!

199
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,519
THEY HAVE You LISTENING.

200
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,320
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

201
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,820
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

202
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,000
You live here also, you two?

203
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,450
In fact, the house of the Boss is also it
general headquarter of the Allied Forces Saruyama.

204
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,450
[Note: Saruyama = Mountain of the Monkey]

205
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,370
But one lives nevertheless on
our boats, in general.

206
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,570
This house is too
small to contain us.

207
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,269
You are too large, the guy!

208
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,050
But, compared to the giants, you
be that droppings of nose!

209
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,070
How they can
to get along so well?

210
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,109
Birds of a feather flock together.

211
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,640
Ca astonishes me that a dwarf as could you, of one
kick, to send in the air this large bacon!

212
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,549
Really?

213
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,639
You also you can do it.

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,459
Good Ah?

215
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,490
Of course. Be to you a monkey after all.

216
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,490
Luffy! It regained consciousness!

217
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,050
Did Ah ouais?

218
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,550
Oh! It is true that it flies well.

219
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,049
Papi Head of Diamond!

220
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,380
One needs small information!

221
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,140
Afflicted for presently.

222
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,800
I thought that you had some
after my gold like these idiots.

223
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,359
Hein?!

224
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,809
You have gold?!

225
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,200
Stop that immediately!

226
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,520
Then in what do I can be useful to you?

227
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,990
Papi, one wants to go on the celestial island!

228
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,300
Say how to make us!

229
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,390
The celestial island?

230
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,960
You really believe in this dream?!

231
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,110
The calm one! It is sick!

232
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,790
You want to say that it
do not exist, papi?!

233
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,200
And well…

234
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,640
I know somebody who
its existence affirmed, but…

235
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,600
it was famous to have been
largest of the liars.

236
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,270
And since, its descendants
are risée of everyone.

237
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,100
It IS NOT ME!

238
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,200
It is an old history which all
people of North Blue know.

239
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,750
“Norland, the Liar.”

240
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,699
Since I say to you that it is not me!

241
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,050
The name is different, you see well?!

242
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,800
Now that you say it, I remember that
its complete name was Montblanc Norland…

243
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,420
Do you have a bond with Norland…?

244
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,599
You are his downward?!

245
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,260
It is here that was held
this famous history?

246
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,680
It is my back-back-arrear…
grandfather, something like that.

247
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,919
A very old ancestor.

248
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,850
Its history me because many troubles.

249
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,740
Even a mosquito would not find
not a drop of its blood in me.

250
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,720
At the time, All the line of Montblanc has
summer condemned to the exile and to live in shame.

251
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,690
And this disgrace us
continues still today.

252
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,640
However, nobody in
family him in forever desired.

253
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,950
Why?

254
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,100
Because Norland was honest
man like one makes some more.

255
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,320
But, the book of tales…

256
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,070
In this book, the last
words of Norland are:

257
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,520
“I know! The gold mountain has
summer absorbed by the floods! “

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,050
It is represented with one
to smile idiotic on the drawing.

259
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,400
But it is said that actually, he cried
all tears of its body.

260
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,920
The island where they accosted was well Jaya,
that where Norland had discovered the Gold City.

261
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,170
It was certainly not
a turn of its imagination.

262
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,700
Norland affirmed that the city had finished at the bottom of water following the movement of the tectonic plates.

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,280
But everyone believed that it
just sought to save its skin.

264
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,270
Norland was carried out in the middle of
sarcastic laughter of the assistance.

265
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,100
Only the “Lying” word
remained in the spirits.

266
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:34,520
I see! It is thus to wash the honor of
Montblanc that you research this absorbed city!

267
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,100
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING!

268
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,850
USOPP!

269
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,540
Oh shit.

270
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,050
That my ancestor was one
honest man or not…

271
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,420
Or that it was large
explorer… I have anything with foutre of it!

272
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,279
You imagine what
can feel a kid…

273
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,950
who undergoes the ceaseless mocking remarks of all it
world under pretext which its ancestor was an idiot?!

274
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,960
I have grows by enduring all that!

275
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,190
Finally…

276
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,110
It is right. During these
four hundred centuries,

277
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,959
many are them
members of my family…

278
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,060
to have taken sea in the hope of
to restore the honor of our line.

279
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,220
But none returned alive.

280
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,350
I was ashamed of my family.

281
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,720
I thus fled all that
and I became pirate.

282
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,130
Then be to you a pirate, papi?

283
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,650
It stays not really a vocation.

284
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,800
I just sought to escape
with the curse of Norland.

285
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,200
Very quickly, I formed
my own crew.

286
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,040
As soon as I entered on Grand
Line, my life was full with adventures.

287
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,450
But ten years ago, the chance wanted
that my ship leads me on this island.

288
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,580
Which irony, whereas it is me which
disavowed Norland and the Montblanc family,

289
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,580
I am the only one to have failed here.

290
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,900
And while I pressed the ground of this island deprived of very Gold Cité, as in the book, I thought:

291
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,800
“It is the destiny.”

292
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,350
I could not escape to him.

293
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,150
Let us stop, Norland!

294
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,009
You joke!

295
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,350
Captain! Your stories of
families, it is not our problem!

296
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,550
If you want to seek this Cité
of Gold, you clear up all alone!

297
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,100
It is here that our ways separate.

298
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,690
Good-bye, Captain.

299
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,190
If it exists, it is well.

300
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,450
But if it does not exist
not, it is well too.

301
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,750
My goal is not
to prove its innocence.

302
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,200
It is right a duel with
that which ruined my life.

303
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,000
I want just to regulate
that, before clamser.

304
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,390
Q-which man!

305
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,449
Then, which report/ratio
with these two monkeys?

306
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,480
What do they make here?

307
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,949
It is surely another
poignant history men…

308
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,850
facing the depths of
the ocean, tightening the elbows!

309
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,039
It is right fans of the book.

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,250
FANS?!

311
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,590
Ca breaks a little the history, that…

312
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,650
They was there are five or six years.

313
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,280
They came to find me afterwards
to have heard rumors on me.

314
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,150
They said, “We are convinced
how the gold of Norland exists! “

315
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,280
SHOUJOU!

316
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,069
Prepare to die
to have done that to me!

317
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,149
Pay attention so that you say, Masira!

318
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,250
Do not cause me!

319
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,550
The sea is deep in the corner.

320
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,090
These great dark and frozen sea-beds
nothing has to go up you the moral one.

321
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,650
Especially when one plunges without
stop alone, day after day.

322
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,350
These deux-là is
encrusted in my life,

323
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,200
without asking my opinion, and they have
issued that I would be their chief.

324
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,240
To look at these two
stupid large unbalances…

325
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,600
honestly, they saved me the life.

326
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,749
You see what I want to say?

327
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,830
Oh yes! Then it is that.

328
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,150
It is so important for a man
to have friendly truths like that.

329
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,219
Good, that is enough for the monkeys!

330
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,350
THEN DOES NOT SPEAK about IT IF It EAST
CA! It IS YOU WHO HAS REQUEST!

331
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,430
How I said!

332
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,940
One wants to go on the celestial island, papi!

333
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,100
You ace really no patience.

334
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,150
You did not listen to me presently?

335
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,550
Only testimony on the celestial island
is that of Norland, the Liar.

336
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,980
Follow its way, and you risk
to become the rized public one, like him.

337
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,700
Hein? It went on
the celestial island too?

338
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,690
If it is the case, it does not have it
written in its book of edge…

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,300
A log book?

340
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,239
It is that of Norland?

341
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,380
Exact.

342
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,580
Lily thus this passage!

343
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,550
Incredible. A newspaper of
four centuries old edge…

344
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,740
“Maritime Calendar of the year
1120, on June 21st, a clear sky. “

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,130
“Have just left it
merry wearing of Villa. “

346
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,450
“Followed the direction
The North-East, indicated by the Log Poses. “

347
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,910
“Acquired of an object
extraordinary coming from a navire marchand. “

348
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,600
“It is about a small boat
single-seater assembled on ski called Waver. “

349
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,950
“It moves with its own wind, even
when this one does not blow on water. “

350
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,020
“I did not can well control it because
that requires a remarkable skill. “

351
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,390
“It became the pastime
favorites of all the crew. “

352
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,329
Ouaah! I want one of them!

353
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,160
GO! LILY THE CONTINUATION!

354
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,850
“It is told that the energy source of Waver
seem to exist only on the celestial island. “

355
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,450
“It would seem that it has there up there
other objects quite as strange. “

356
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,820
“In connection with the celestial island, a fellow-member
explorer has me one day shown a flying fish. “

357
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,729
“I can say to you that it is
a quite strange creature. “

358
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,780
A flying fish?

359
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,629
“The celestial seas remained
inaccessible to our ship,

360
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,520
but as a sailor, I hope
a day to foam them well. “

361
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,750
“Montblanc Norland.”

362
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,889
Celestial seas!

363
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,950
Robin was right!

364
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,640
And it would seem that at the time, nobody
did not doubt the existence of the celestial island!

365
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,370
Then, it really exists!

366
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,599
Eh, Boss! Is Ca better?

367
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,889
With the hair!

368
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,430
Good news.

369
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,619
Boss… this type, it has…

370
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,930
Listen to me, both!

371
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,230
You like them?

372
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,620
Why you requests that?

373
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,520
It would be said that they are well
decided to reach the celestial island.

374
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,630
The celestial island?

375
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,570
But there is one
means of going up there.

376
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,880
And only, they in
will not escape, Boss!

377
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,080
This is why I ask you the question.

378
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,000
What would say you of their
to give a small knack?

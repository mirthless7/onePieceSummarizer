1
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,650
Luffy accepted Davy Back Fight which opposes it to Foxy.

2
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:07,183
In the first test, Donut Race
the pirates of the straw hat lost.

3
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,316
We will start by taking some
one… and that which I chose are…

4
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:15,050
YOU! The doctor, Tony Tony Chopper!

5
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,116
Okay, made as you want!

6
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,182
to recover Chopper,

7
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:27,183
they will have to gain the second sleeve, Groggy Ring.

8
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,115
Surprised?

9
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,716
At all.

10
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:38,750
SECOND ROUND!
SHOOTER IN THE GROGGY BOXING RING!

11
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:46,916
Our warriors, still unconquered in Groggy Boxing ring,

12
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,850
will put full the sight of it to us against…

13
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,782
The cook bastonnor, Sanji!

14
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:54,850
It is the cook of “first class”

15
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,849
And, with a premium of 60 million Berrys…

16
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,850
The hunter of pirates, Roronoa Zoro!

17
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,116
I wondered which was our adversaries
so that one calls upon us…

18
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,783
Isn't this, Big Bang?

19
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,983
Hein?

20
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:14,615
He did not hear you.

21
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:15,782
It is what these guys?

22
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:17,983
This part will indicate which will make the kickoff.

23
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,182
Crush.

24
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,315
And you?

25
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,783
It already chose, that is used for nothing…

26
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:27,650
It is pile.

27
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,115
Ground or ball?

28
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:33,249
Ball.

29
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,183
Our Groggy Monsters chose the ball!

30
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,782
The ball of the team of the straw hat must
to place itself in the central round of the unfavourable ground!

31
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:41,582
Which side?

32
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,582
One of fout.

33
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:46,050
During this play there will be two man-balloon
that one will recognize thanks to their cover-chief.

34
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:50,516
It is enough to put the ball in
the unfavourable buoy to gain!

35
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,316
You dispatch!

36
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,449
The ball.

37
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,849
Grouille of going in your place.

38
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,915
Oï, Oï…

39
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,516
It is you who decided ace all alone.

40
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:02,916
I ever agreed to be the ball.

41
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,449
Why should I carry this weak trick?

42
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,316
Stop feeling sorry for you.

43
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,382
Oh? Does the ball that suit you well you know?

44
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,315
THE FARM! YOU BELIEVE THAT I
WILL FALL INTO THE PANEL!

45
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:14,315
Zoro!

46
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:15,382
Sanji!

47
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:17,182
Put to them a beating!

48
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,449
Make return Chopper, please!

49
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,516
There are not any more an other choice because of my defeat.

50
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,715
It is the first time that I see a giant man-fish.

51
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:30,316
It is not as large as a true giant.

52
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:35,316
Encourage them as much as you
will want, that will not be used for nothing.

53
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,983
Our team is expert of Groggy Ring.

54
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:42,850
You ace a problem? Head of puzzle.

55
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,983
He still said it!

56
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,583
Iyan, Oyabi.

57
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,916
Would not be so hard, straw hat!

58
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,916
Good, I think that there is no reason
so that I interfere in the play.

59
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,182
I will be spectator, like you.

60
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,515
Does Ca pose a problem to you?

61
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,782
What? It is also possible to obstruct in this sleeve?

62
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,650
Idiot! You can intervene
in any sleeve!

63
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,316
But there are teams which play honestly.

64
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:14,315
And there are of them others which want to cheat.

65
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,516
It is according to the tastes of each one.

66
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:22,315
Moreover, those which complain to have
summer obstructed by cheaters,

67
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:27,316
are larvae which did not include/understand anything with the life of pirate.

68
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,583
What do you want to say by there?

69
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,583
And what does it occur with your team?

70
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,783
They do not have any esprit d'équipe.

71
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:40,916
Say what you want. When the match
will start, these deux-là…

72
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,515
You cheated ace!

73
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,582
You ace carried out your movement after me…

74
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,116
At all! I gained in the rules!

75
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,715
It is because I am stronger than you.

76
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,850
Hein?!

77
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,450
About what you do speak?

78
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:54,183
It is Janken.
[Rock-Paper-Chisel]

79
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,382
And you lost ace.

80
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:58,716
Dispatch you to indicate the ball, you two.

81
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,850
They are still in the train of chamailler…

82
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:05,249
Sanji-kun, this ball suits you to charm!

83
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,983
I will be the ball!!

84
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,982
I am the best for that!!

85
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,916
Ouais, that suits you really well…

86
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,316
You resemble a prince…

87
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,716
… the prince of the idiots.

88
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,783
Begin this match, good blood!

89
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:28,650
Hey, the weapons go against the rules!

90
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:30,583
Leave your katana.

91
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:32,115
Ah? Really?

92
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:34,850
Ouais, it is a play of ball!

93
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,650
You already saw a play of ball
where the weapons are authorized?

94
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,916
In any event the result will be the same one.

95
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,183
Are Oï, to you on that will go?

96
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,516
A epeist without his swords, it is.

97
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,916
It is what?

98
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,916
It is idiot and that is used for nothing.

99
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,450
Will you play or not?!

100
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,983
Then?!

101
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,849
Now, finally…

102
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,583
The ball “Sanji” of the team of the hat of
straw is ready for the kickoff.

103
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,249
I hope that you will be made re-silver, cook.

104
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,250
The farm.

105
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,450
Crush them, Big Bang!

106
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:17,315
The encouragements become intense!

107
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:18,382
Big Bang.

108
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:20,650
Let us stop quickly!

109
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:27,850
He did not hear you.

110
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,983
You know… He He… you ace need
to listen more attentively…

111
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,582
As usual, Groggy monsters have
air to have fun in their corner!

112
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,650
During this general giggle, I go in
to profit to state the rules!

113
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:56,516
There is no limit of time!
Mark a point and it is the victory!

114
00:07:57,316 --> 00:08:02,316
Nothing simpler, to gain I have just with shooter
this giant to place it in the buoy behind him.

115
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:12,250
And one loses if the head of the cook enters our buoy…

116
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:20,050
The crew of the straw hat
will it be able to recover its reindeer?

117
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:21,382
Burst them!

118
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:25,116
Or the crew of Foxy
a novel member will still gain?

119
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:28,250
It is pitiless Groggy Ring!

120
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,783
And we await the signal now…

121
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,050
The match can start!

122
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,583
Now, how the ball “Sanji” will move?

123
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,315
It will attack or move back?

124
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,250
It left!

125
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:53,316
Pickles makes the first movement with Tackle Demon!

126
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:54,315
Yosh.

127
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,650
I will finish some all alone.

128
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,183
I do not want to occupy me of you!
My only target, it is him!

129
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,116
If I release you in the other side of the ground, one will gain!

130
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,450
It is a face-to-face discussion between the two balls!

131
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,715
What?! The skin of this type is all slipping!

132
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:21,250
Sanji, the cook, slips on the tended arm of Big Bang!

133
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:23,850
But it was foreseeable!

134
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,450
Big Bang is an man-eel giant,
its body is thus extremely slipping!

135
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,716
What you insane?!
Species of cretin!

136
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,049
An opening!

137
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,650
To you be reached brain or what?!

138
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,716
Hey, which it is that is reached of the brain here?!

139
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,582
Here it is!

140
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,716
The super long master key of Big Bang!

141
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,316
Sanji!

142
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,383
Hamburger runs to catch the ball…

143
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,649
And Roronoa Zoro pursues it closely.

144
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,916
If you tombs with an aim, I kill to you!

145
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,983
The farm! It is because you stays speaking to me!

146
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,116
Hein?

147
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:13,583
Pickles has just entered the unfavourable ground!

148
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:17,383
And now, Hamburger… will be able it
to catch Sanji in full flight?

149
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,983
Yes, it is done!

150
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,115
Well, well!

151
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:26,316
Pickles awaits it firm footing!

152
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,583
Wait, jerk! You dared ace!

153
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:30,916
Roronoa arrives at any pace!

154
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:37,915
How…?

155
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,983
Pickles makes rebound the ball “Sanji” in the airs!

156
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:44,782
Sanji!

157
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,449
Big Bang will put the final key!

158
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,850
It returns Hamburger which fell!

159
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:55,382
And Hamburger catches up with Sanji!

160
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:56,950
It is…!

161
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,716
The buoy is with range of shooting!

162
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,782
Cretin of rolled eyebrows!

163
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:07,717
He will do it, it is the Hamburger dunk!

164
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:14,250
What you insane?

165
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,516
Made something! Zoro!

166
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:17,783
Sanji!

167
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,383
Is the match about to be completed?

168
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,317
You ace not with me to point out it…

169
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,717
You think that I will let these assholes gain?!

170
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:40,117
Of course that it is not finished.

171
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,050
I am still with the signal.

172
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:46,783
If I let this epeist help himself…

173
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,583
I would never have my moment of glory!

174
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,783
I would not lose!

175
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:01,583
No the goal!

176
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:09,017
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

177
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:16,317
MUGIWARA-TEAM

178
00:12:16,617 --> 00:12:18,816
No the goal!

179
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:22,817
Sanji will not return with an aim so easily!

180
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,950
I defend you to intervene!

181
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,883
You reacted ace too late, imbecile!

182
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,217
A duet able to embank Groggy
Monsters by the force appeared!

183
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,083
An impressive match will take place!

184
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,617
It is never considering, it is without precedent!

185
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:48,017
The giants are struck!

186
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,082
Crowd is amazed!

187
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,550
The team of the straw hat is very strong!

188
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,750
Do not think that I needed your assistance.

189
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:59,483
I did that because one cannot trust you.

190
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:01,416
These guy are monstrous.

191
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,817
These dumbs balanced Pickles!

192
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,483
And struck Hamburger.

193
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,350
Be to you really that a good with nothing.

194
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,083
You merits even not your statute.

195
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,816
Iyan. What do you await Hamburger?

196
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:24,682
You ace not interest to lose!

197
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:26,949
You want to fight, PERVERSE COOK?!!

198
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,016
I said that I was going to also overcome them, EYEBROWS ROLL!

199
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:29,882
And you…

200
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:32,949
Do what I say to you and CLOSES it!

201
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,016
Be to you IDIOT or WHAT?!

202
00:13:35,017 --> 00:13:36,282
Let us see, see.

203
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:39,350
The crew of the straw hat acts curiously…

204
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,682
The balls are in their own half of ground.

205
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:45,483
The play continues, but they fight
still as so of nothing was not.

206
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,016
They are barges, these deux-là.

207
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:49,716
Cretins!

208
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:52,749
Do Zoro, Sanji, what you foutez at the end?

209
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,349
It is your chance! The ball is all alone!

210
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,350
And you of it occupy stop beating you!

211
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,550
Wanting to take the match in hand,
Big Bang seizes its chance!

212
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,850
It is…

213
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,283
Why you run?! This guy is the ball!

214
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,882
I know that, but…

215
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:21,283
This guy has knives under
soles of its shoes!

216
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,717
He the referee L

217
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:28,350
The weapons are supposed being prohibited!

218
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,282
He, the referee! Why you do anything?! Reacted!

219
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,949
- Useless, It looks in another direction.
He, the referee! Why you do anything?! Reacted!

220
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,549
He, the referee! Why you do anything?! Reacted!

221
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,883
Te insane step of me!

222
00:14:50,417 --> 00:14:52,017
Not, not that, Sanji-kun!

223
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,883
Dumb! You ace all considering and it is what all this
sweat which dégouline of your mug, hein?!

224
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,950
I do not have…

225
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,149
I do not have anything considering.

226
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,149
Salt lying!

227
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,817
Hey, is calmed, it is the referee.

228
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,283
Sanji of the crew of the straw hat, Carton Jaune!

229
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,817
What?! Species of dumb!

230
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,417
Calm yourself, I said to you to calm yourself!

231
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:18,150
We had it! The first carton jaune of the match!

232
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,617
If Sanji receives some another, it will be excluded from the ground!

233
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,883
Who will be excluded from the ground?!

234
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:29,949
To be caught some with a referee, what a weak!

235
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,617
Your mouth if not you will be the next one!

236
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,217
A weak truth.

237
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:38,616
In any event, the weapon of it…

238
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:39,283
In any event, the weapon of it…

239
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:42,083
But await… it is an axe?!

240
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,749
It is a coïcidence, I do not have anything considering.

241
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,482
He, subdues to me that, the referee!

242
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:50,550
It is an axe this time, it uses an axe!

243
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,416
He, is calmed! What
will happen if you are excluded?

244
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,883
I in do not have anything to wax! I cannot
blairer this referee of shit!

245
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,950
Mets not in anger! Do not fall into their play!

246
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,549
Never!

247
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,883
Calm yourself! It is for the good of Chopper!

248
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,882
I will stick good to him!

249
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,149
I beg you, does not complicate the things!

250
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,483
Sanji-kun, gains this match!

251
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,283
I will gain!

252
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,617
I would never include myself/understand.

253
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:19,550
Go, it left!

254
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,083
Pas la pains to begin again where were to you!

255
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:29,216
The situation does not improve one would say.

256
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:31,816
I believe that I have measuring rod his weak point.

257
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,549
It is time that the things change!

258
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,150
This time the hunter becomes driven out!

259
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,617
Mets not on my way!
I can occupy myself some all alone!

260
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,817
, You cooperate are supposed being a team!

261
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,083
Finally, the counter-attack is launched!

262
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:54,683
One cannot attack it directly
on the skin, it slips.

263
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:58,317
One little to attack his hands,
its feet, its mask or its shorts.

264
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:02,817
Shit!

265
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,349
Here it is! Lifting Racing Circus!

266
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,883
They can slip indefinitely on its back!

267
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:18,350
I will not twice be made have,
it is like iceskate!

268
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,149
Impossible to escape!

269
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,249
I will stack!

270
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,317
You beat seriously!

271
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:28,550
During this time, two other players
were raised and return in the play!

272
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:31,950
He, they returned! Come them botter the bottom!

273
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:35,082
Oh not! It would seem that they were re-equipped!

274
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,882
Hamburger has steel fists and…

275
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,283
kinds of sharp-edged circular coudières.

276
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,883
Its Pickles fellow-member covered
shoulder pads provided with peaks!

277
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,417
We point out that arm are prohibited!

278
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,749
What a coincidence!

279
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,883
The referee stretches and turns the back on the play!

280
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,683
I am really irritated, Leader.

281
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,217
Allons-y!

282
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,483
I have the head which turns…

283
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,350
Go! One goes there!

284
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:13,617
It left!

285
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:16,549
The players ghosts counter-attack!

286
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,082
It is not a question of the ball.

287
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,350
He aims at the epeist, Roronoa, with his steel fists!

288
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,149
Zoro!

289
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,016
The attack is not finished!

290
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:34,816
Without delay, Big Bang prepares its attack!

291
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:39,350
Hamburger is put in position. It places its
elbows with the steel discs ahead!

292
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:40,282
Not!

293
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:41,550
It does not go…!

294
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,550
They is dangerous! Ca can really badly turn!

295
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,750
An arrow would be said!

296
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,883
Zoro!

297
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,483
It is a direct blow!

298
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,750
Naturally, in Groggy Boxing ring,
the participants can die.

299
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:18,817
My head turns.

300
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:22,283
The crew of Foxy does not leave them any respite!

301
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:27,949
I feel badly…

302
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,349
Here a blow of shoulder covered with peaks mortals!

303
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,683
Sanji, releases from there!

304
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,883
A blow directed towards the ball, Sanji.

305
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,483
Hamburger strikes it in the back!

306
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,417
It would be said that it does not aim the goal!

307
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:01,883
Groggy Monsters connected
several terrible attacks!

308
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:49,083
They are really cruel.

309
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,350
Zoro!

310
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,083
Sanji!

311
00:20:57,217 --> 00:21:01,216
The team of the straw hat will not belong itself to as soon as!

312
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:03,017
It was an easy victory!

313
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,350
They are really groggy!

314
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,816
Now, they do not have any more but to put
the ball in the circle…

315
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:14,750
and it will be our second victory.

316
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,682
Invincible,

317
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:17,616
incredibly strong,

318
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,617
they are Groggy Monsters!

319
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:21,617
One still gained!

320
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:35,083
He, cook.

321
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,883
You do not want to help me ten seconds.

322
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,217
Ca would have…

323
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,283
us to be enough…

1
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,226
Don't run, you thief!

2
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,529
Give us back our map!

3
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:10,616
What?

4
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,479
Someone fell down.

5
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,511
Thank God I'm alive.

6
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,757
What a strange journey this is!

7
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,741
"Fear, Mysterious
Power! Pirate Clown Captain Buggy!"

8
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:29,496
"Kyoufu Nazo no Chikara!
Kaizoku Douke Buggy-Senchou!"

9
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:34,135
I am so hungry.

10
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:36,868
Boss, are you here to save me?

11
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,655
Yes?

12
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:39,262
Who are you?

13
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,043
You take it from here, boss!

14
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,717
Hey, that woman ran away!

15
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,346
Let her go, her boss is here anyway.

16
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:53,015
You are right.

17
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,252
Are you here to save your underling?

18
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:57,633
Do we have food here?

19
00:02:58,164 --> 00:03:00,860
Damn it! Don't mess around with us!

20
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:11,705
Don't you dare hurt my baby.

21
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,292
Bastard!

22
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,549
Might that guy be killed?

23
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:19,583
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOLET!

24
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:29,289
You are so wonderful!

25
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,993
I got rid of them within 2 seconds.

26
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:37,399
Ah.. you are the one who just...

27
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:38,401
Who are you?

28
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:42,440
I steal pirates'
treasure. Nami's my name.

29
00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:44,702
Hey, would you like to join me?

30
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:48,041
No, I don't want to.

31
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,115
Wait a second.

32
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:52,915
Hold on.

33
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:57,653
I almost forgot

34
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,884
I am starving!

35
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:02,358
Let me buy you dinner, ok?

36
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:03,826
Really?

37
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:04,577
Yes.

38
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:10,760
Haven't you caught the thief?

39
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:14,965
We are working hard on it.

40
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:16,622
Captain Buggy. Yes.

41
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:23,139
Why would the map be stolen so easily?

42
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:29,184
Don't you forget we are
sailing toward the "Grand Line."

43
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:33,752
But the keeper who had the key
left it on by accident, Captain.

44
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:36,219
What did you say?

45
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,262
I said he left it on.

46
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,368
Whose nose are you laughing at?

47
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,284
<i>(In Japanese, "Left It On"
sounds similar to "Nose".)</i>

48
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:43,368
<i>(In Viz's English manga, the henchman
says, "And only the robber KNOWS...")</i>

49
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:47,601
Do you think my round nose is funny?

50
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,674
No, you misunderstood me.

51
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,772
You think my nose is big and red?

52
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:53,155
<i>("Misunderstood" and "Big Red Nose"
also sounds similar in Japanese.)</i>

53
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,546
<i>(In Viz's manga, "mistake" sounded like "steak",
another offending word for Buggy's nose.)</i>

54
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:55,305
Help!

55
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,553
He will use his power!

56
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,379
"Devil Fruit" power!

57
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:13,137
Who am I?

58
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,602
Captain Buggy!

59
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,643
What will you end up
if you fight against me?

60
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:27,337
End up dead.

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,539
Please spare my life.

62
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,313
I won't say anything wrong again.

63
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:35,148
Please give me a chance.

64
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:42,290
I can spare you this time
for saying something wrong.

65
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:44,787
You have to get back the map.

66
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,331
If you fail, you know
what you will become.

67
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,040
Yes, Captain Buggy!

68
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:56,536
Delicious.

69
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:59,110
You live in such a
big house by yourself?

70
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,146
I don't live here.

71
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:05,615
The townspeople were so afraid
of Buggy, they all ran away.

72
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:06,844
So you broke in here?

73
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:08,112
You are so rude.

74
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:11,451
I am a thief who only
steals from pirates.

75
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,638
Don't compare me with
those degraded thieves!

76
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:16,464
You are thieves anyway, aren't you?

77
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:22,322
My goal is to earn 100 million Belly.

78
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:26,530
Why do you need so much money?

79
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:28,231
It's a secret.

80
00:06:28,374 --> 00:06:33,835
As long as I have the map, it should
be easy to earn 100 million Belly.

81
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,381
Map? Are you a sailor?

82
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,126
I am better than a sailor.

83
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,155
That's great.

84
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,588
Would you like to
join us to be a sailor?

85
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:48,057
Really?

86
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:50,560
To be a part of our team.

87
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:52,255
No.

88
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,724
So you are a pirate, too.

89
00:06:55,868 --> 00:06:57,859
Yes, I had a vow.

90
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:02,634
I told the one who gave me this hat
that I will find enough partners.

91
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:06,241
I hate pirates more than
anything else in the world!

92
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,370
But I love money! And tangerines!

93
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,607
Please be our sailor.

94
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,684
I said I don't want to!

95
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:14,810
No.

96
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,615
Hey, did you find it?

97
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:18,463
No.

98
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:21,590
Where is that female thief hiding?

99
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:23,124
We'll be dead if we don't find the map!

100
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:28,827
<i>Those guys... I have to
think of some methods.</i>

101
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:33,203
If you agree with my deal,
I would think about it.

102
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,773
Really? I can give
you anything you want.

103
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:39,886
I want you to go to
Buggy the Clown with me.

104
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,979
Why would you tie me up?

105
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,417
It's just a rope. Got
a problem with that?

106
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:49,816
It doesn't matter.

107
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:52,554
It's not a bad thing to meet
the pirate leader. Let's go now!

108
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:54,730
Hey, wait for me.

109
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:58,158
What?

110
00:07:58,297 --> 00:07:59,649
You let the thief run away!

111
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:04,128
We are very sorry, Captain!

112
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,205
What do I need you for?

113
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,909
Go hang yourselves now!

114
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,901
Captain Buggy!

115
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:12,977
What is it?

116
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,876
The thief comes to us now.

117
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:16,255
What did you say?

118
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:22,819
They are these two!

119
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:24,248
That woman stole our map!

120
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,963
I caught the real thief, Captain Buggy.

121
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,567
This is your map.

122
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:37,828
I am glad you return it to me.

123
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,133
What do you want for return?

124
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:46,942
I broke up with my boss. I
couldn't stand him any longer.

125
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,972
Please let me join you team.

126
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,579
Captain Buggy is getting angry.

127
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,082
The power of "Devil Fruit"
is coming out again. Devil?

128
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:06,054
You couldn't stand
him? This girl is funny.

129
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,600
I like it, so I'll let you in.

130
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,935
<i>Infiltration succeeds!</i>

131
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:18,305
<i>Those pirates are so
stupid to be fooled.</i>

132
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:21,645
Why did you put me in cage?

133
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:27,209
Because I am happy today.

134
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:29,287
Girl, what is your name?

135
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:29,927
Nami.

136
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:34,359
Alright, let's hold a
party to welcome Nami.

137
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:35,586
Everyone enjoy yourselves.

138
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:38,020
Yes!

139
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,406
What's wrong? This is your party.

140
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:57,365
Eat some more.

141
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,887
Yes, thank you captain.

142
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:05,389
<i>I will steal the map
back when I have chance.</i>

143
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:09,552
<i>And all of Buggy's
treasure along the way.</i>

144
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,682
I want some too.

145
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,034
Ohh...

146
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:36,248
I am in such a good mood.

147
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,190
Guys, get the Buggy Ball ready!

148
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:42,954
Yes!

149
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,440
It is ready!

150
00:11:05,885 --> 00:11:08,479
What do we need that for?

151
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,647
Witness the power of
the Buggy Ball! Fire!

152
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,248
What the heck was that?

153
00:11:42,488 --> 00:11:44,640
That is Master Buggy's Buggy Ball!

154
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:46,856
Buggy Ball?

155
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:09,705
It is so pretty.

156
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:14,752
With the Buggy Ball and the Devil
Fruit, I can rule the Grand Line!

157
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:16,480
Am I right, Nami?

158
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:17,512
Yes, of course.

159
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:18,723
Why?

160
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,870
I am the only ruler of the Grand Line!

161
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,095
What?

162
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:27,064
I want to be the pirate king.

163
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,269
You idiot!

164
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,970
Nami, now I know why
you can't stand him.

165
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,532
I told you.

166
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:39,770
This guy is too naive,
and lacks experience.

167
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:42,413
I can't follow him.

168
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:47,875
I can understand. I'll give you a Buggy
Ball. Then you can blow your former boss.

169
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:55,261
And show your loyalty to me, too. Ready!

170
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:04,902
I don't need it.

171
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:08,685
This is a great party!
Let's drink some more!

172
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,247
Do it now. This is the
rule of our welcome party.

173
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:28,597
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

174
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:32,366
<i>I will be killed if I don't fire.</i>

175
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:37,376
<i>But if I do, I will
be part of the pirates!</i>

176
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,150
OK! Fire now!

177
00:13:55,295 --> 00:14:05,330
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

178
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,934
Nami, what are you waiting for?

179
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,206
What is wrong?

180
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:15,817
You hands are shaking.

181
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:22,081
You are not loyal enough
that's why you hesitate.

182
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:27,819
Loyal? Does killing
somebody mean loyalty?

183
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,360
No.

184
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:34,525
It is the loyalty
that you would die for.

185
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:41,373
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

186
00:14:41,374 --> 00:14:43,899
Hey, newcomer, don't hesitate.

187
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,886
Let me teach you.

188
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:10,202
Damn. I couldn't help myself!

189
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,301
Nami, what the hell are you doing?

190
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,498
I am sorry.

191
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:18,475
What? Do you think apology is enough?

192
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:21,808
What's wrong with you?
Can't you save me earlier?

193
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:25,850
Shut up, idiot! I was
out of my mind then!

194
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:29,477
Besides, I don't want to be
a part of you vicious pirates.

195
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:31,419
You were out of your mind.

196
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,584
Pirates took someone dear to me!
I'll never become what I hate!

197
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,094
Ah, I see now.

198
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:42,399
Aagh! The fuse is lit!

199
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:45,800
Stinky girl, you fooled me.

200
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,720
Kill her now!

201
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:53,642
No way.

202
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,441
Go to hell.

203
00:15:58,651 --> 00:15:59,950
Put it out! Put it out!

204
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,054
Am I finished?

205
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:14,279
You...

206
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:27,738
Behind you!

207
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,370
Die!

208
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:47,194
Hey, she is just a girl. You are not
hero enough to treat her so violently.

209
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:49,020
Zoro.

210
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:56,541
Did you get hurt?

211
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:57,802
What?

212
00:16:57,944 --> 00:16:59,605
Did you get hurt?

213
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:02,010
No, I am fine.

214
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:04,311
Ah, that is great.

215
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,179
You are marvelous. How
did you know we are here?

216
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,946
Get me out of here now.

217
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,783
What's the game you are playing?

218
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:13,949
First the bird took you;
now you are in the cage.

219
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,118
I found it quite interesting.

220
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:17,854
Zoro?

221
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:20,932
That kid called him "Zoro".

222
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,399
<i>Is the other partner he mentioned...</i>

223
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:25,570
<i>the "bounty hunter" Zoro?</i>

224
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,067
<i>What is going on?</i>

225
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,766
Are you Zoro?

226
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,608
Why are you here? To get my head?

227
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,841
No, I am not interested.

228
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:41,852
I quit being a bounty
hunter a long time ago.

229
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:43,956
I am interested in you.

230
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,718
I can be famous if I kill you.

231
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,157
Better not, or you'll die.

232
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:52,196
Oh, really?

233
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,086
Are you blind or deaf?

234
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:59,335
Come on, captain!

235
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,633
Captain Buggy!

236
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:09,858
Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, Buggy,
Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, [etc.]

237
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:28,424
Go to hell!

238
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:50,020
This guy dies too fast.

239
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:53,182
Wow, he really sucks.

240
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:55,385
No. Huh?

241
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:06,429
Are those guys mad?

242
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:07,766
What is going on?

243
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:10,967
Their captain was just
killed, and they are laughing.

244
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,475
You.

245
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,876
What's so funny?

246
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:23,568
Zoro!

247
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:26,723
What's wrong with your hand?

248
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:29,259
What the hell...?

249
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,323
The Chop-Chop Fruit.

250
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:39,395
This is the name of the fruit I ate.

251
00:19:40,606 --> 00:19:44,804
I am the die hard Chop-Chop man!

252
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,911
His body comes together again.

253
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:53,280
I thought "Devil
Fruit" is just a legend.

254
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,277
"Chop-Chop man"... this guy is a freak.

255
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:02,952
Though I didn't hit your vitals,
the wound is pretty deep, right?

256
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:04,494
Surrender.

257
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,257
Captain is so great.

258
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:10,665
Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, Buggy...

259
00:20:11,204 --> 00:20:14,469
<i>The situation turns around.</i>

260
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,294
<i>If it goes on like this,
those two and I will be dead.</i>

261
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,219
It is too severe.

262
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:31,923
Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, Buggy...

263
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:34,154
Attack behind me! You are so nasty!

264
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:35,499
Big nose!

265
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:43,309
<i>You idiot! You can't say that word!</i>

266
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,889
Damn you...

267
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:51,984
Who is "big nose"?

268
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:56,764
Buggy!

269
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:02,246
I will kick you up to the sky.

270
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:09,021
Kick me to the sky? Are you joking?

271
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:12,653
The three of you will die here.

272
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:14,993
How can you hit me in such a situation?

273
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,659
Come on, come on, come on!

274
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,246
It's over. We're dead.

275
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:29,009
I'm not gonna die!

276
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,640
Run now, Zoro.

277
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:32,716
What?

278
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:35,821
You told your partner to
run? I am here to save you.

279
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,110
What should you do?

280
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:44,554
I got it.

281
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,597
<i>What? I don't get it.</i>

282
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,693
<i>I told you I hate pirates most.</i>

283
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,901
Stupid kid! You can't escape from me!

284
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:05,250
Stupid kid, your knave is not working.

285
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:07,566
Damn you! Let me finish!

286
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:27,668
The cannon is aiming toward us!

287
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:29,333
Light the fuse!

288
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:29,964
Why?

289
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:31,331
Hurry up! OK!

290
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:33,944
Wait, wait, wait!

291
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,747
The "Buggy Ball" is inside!

292
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:43,119
Nasty kid.

293
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:47,512
The fuse! It's over! We're dead!

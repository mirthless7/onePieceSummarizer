1
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:49,220
Cherry trees of Hiluluk

2
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:49,220
The Heritage of its Will!

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,880
He! It is what your problem?!

4
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,010
What you can be dogged!

5
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,750
I want you in my crew!

6
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,460
You see, you still insist!

7
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,680
They is super to be a pirate!

8
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,610
Ca is enough!

9
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,570
Profit to be locked up here to put back you!

10
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,480
The wounds which you ace…

11
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,480
There is not what to joke, you know!

12
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,050
PF, what a cretin!

13
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,370
Eh?

14
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,030
How?!

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,740
Wait!

16
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,930
It is which this type?
How did it catch the keys?

17
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,370
Attends Attends Wait Wait Wait!

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
Wait!

19
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,210
This odor…

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,090
Wapol!

21
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,560
When he heard that Hiluluk had nothing any more but ten days to live…

22
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,490
… Chopper was very cut down.

23
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,580
It is normal after all.

24
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,310
But it had in heart to do everything to save it and it thus took the things in hands.

25
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,880
I am… dying?!

26
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,110
I will make flower of the cherry trees on this island.

27
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,230
You see, it is the symbol of my will…

28
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,470
… which defies the impossible one!

29
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,180
What does it occur?

30
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,100
Today, the frequency of the turns of round curiously decreased.

31
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,820
In fact, at the request of Isshi-20, the troops left to gather mushrooms.

32
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,960
Mushrooms?

33
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,620
They had the role of finding mushrooms likely to treat all kinds of diseases.

34
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,660
Mushrooms?

35
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,950
Imbecile, they could locate us!

36
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,370
Did doctor, about what speak?

37
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,550
I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE YOU OF EVIL!

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,520
Give the feet never again here!

39
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,220
What I have fact is wretched…

40
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,460
But at least, you will be the witness of my work.

41
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,360
My ultimate invention.

42
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,410
What?! Still missed!

43
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,410
Shit!

44
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,940
I do not have any more time.

45
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,770
For a man who raises the banner to tête de mort, nothing is impossible!

46
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,000
It is what I taught you!

47
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,260
I will fight!

48
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,460
How a pirate!

49
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,640
Over there!

50
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,210
Amiudake.

51
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,020
I found one of them.

52
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,990
But…

53
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,330
How I will cross?

54
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,410
Shit!

55
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,870
So close to the goal!

56
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,830
I am so close to the goal!

57
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,520
Doctor…

58
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,560
I am sorry…

59
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,500
Your preferred book…

60
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
I lost it.

61
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,990
What did it arrive to you?

62
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,810
This mushroom…

63
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,790
It is a drug.

64
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,080
It is Amiudake!

65
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,310
You… went to seek it for me?

66
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,400
It is necessary to live.
It is necessary to live, Doctor.

67
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,880
I want to become a doctor.

68
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,730
Teach me because I want to be a doctor like you.

69
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,690
I can also fight!

70
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,130
Like a pirate.

71
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,440
I do not know if a reindeer can arrive there.

72
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,970
Of course that if, you can!

73
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,060
You can!

74
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,410
You can!

75
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,080
You will be an eminent doctor!

76
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,210
Doctor, that hurt…

77
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,840
You have good heart so much!

78
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,270
Idiot…

79
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,750
Chess! Kuromarimo!

80
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
Does hunting for the doctors advance well?

81
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,680
We already exiled almost all the doctors.

82
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,770
Almost?!

83
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,440
There remain still two doctors to be captured.

84
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,010
Doctor Kureha and…

85
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,840
… this charlatan of Doctor Hiluluk.

86
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
What you say?!

87
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,510
Oh. I have just had an excellent idea.

88
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,740
Inform the people that Isshi-20…

89
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,680
… are in the incapacity to look after people.

90
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,790
The soup of Amiudake…

91
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,890
They is good?

92
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,400
Hurk! It is wretched!

93
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,210
Nobody can swallow that!

94
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,060
I see…

95
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,950
Do not make this head.

96
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,200
The best drugs always have a bad taste.

97
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,840
That proves that it is effective.

98
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,200
I thank you, Chopper.

99
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,000
What is it?

100
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,370
I succeeded!

101
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,310
I finally succeeded!

102
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,760
Ca is there.

103
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,100
Ca makes thirty years that I await this reaction.

104
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,780
I succeeded, Chopper!!

105
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,500
My research succeeded!

106
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,490
I knew that it would go!
I knew it! I knew it!

107
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:03,570
THE CHERRY TREES WILL BE ABLE TO FLOWER ON THIS SNOW-COVERED ISLAND!

108
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,680
Do not forget, during my absence, does not move and rests.

109
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,390
Included/understood.

110
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,210
I return quickly.

111
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,400
The Doctor was so content.

112
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,990
I… managed to cure somebody of patient.

113
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,210
You will be an eminent doctor.

114
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,490
I am sure.

115
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,500
You saw, all the country is invaded by panic.

116
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,390
I noticed.

117
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,590
They say that Isshi-20 are sick.

118
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,630
Imbeciles.

119
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,750
And by the way? What brings you here?

120
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,910
I wanted to ask you…

121
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,750
Not, it is out of the question.

122
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,300
But I still anything asked you!

123
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,270
It is what this dirtiness?

124
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,260
You see there, the thirty long year old fruit of research.

125
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,490
My panacea can cure the torn heart of a country!

126
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,990
Ca wants to say that you ace wasted thirty years of your life. I hope at least that you had fun?!

127
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,150
But then? Why do you give me that?

128
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,800
There is not enough of it. And I am with court of time.

129
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
I want that you make flower the cherry trees in my place.

130
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,550
Imbecile, why should I do that?

131
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,910
And still a thing.

132
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,160
Teach medicine with Chopper.

133
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,310
He wants to become doctor.

134
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,570
I heard some enough!

135
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,880
It is a reindeer!

136
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,120
Do not insist!

137
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,750
A monster would be said!
But it can become an eminent doctor!

138
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,210
It has good heart.

139
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,650
It risked its life to bring a drug to me!

140
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,930
I beseech you with knees! Make of him a doctor!

141
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,820
There are limits not to exceed!

142
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,890
You want that I deal with your absurd research as well as tone monster of company!

143
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,450
Even if you are dying, does not count on my compassion!

144
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,100
Maintaining outside!

145
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,760
Yes, I included/understood.

146
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,230
Ca makes a long time that I know you.

147
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,790
You will deal with all.

148
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,660
Ca does not resemble itself, Hiluluk.

149
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,980
To lower the arms like that.

150
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,830
I am with court of time.

151
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,850
The idiot does not go…!

152
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,540
What you known as?!

153
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,300
Isshi-20 are sick?!

154
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,890
But which will deal with the patients?

155
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,490
Please! Give us at least drugs!

156
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,110
One can nothing make for you!

157
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,350
Even the doctors can fall sick!

158
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,110
Release!

159
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,500
Hiluluk!

160
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,870
Release! Release! Release! Release!

161
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,740
The dumb!

162
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,220
Mets goes the TV-cable from there!

163
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,120
Lead me to the castle!

164
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,210
Where is Hiluluk?

165
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,890
You do not need to flee!

166
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,510
I know already who you are!

167
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,300
But where is this idiot of charlatan?!

168
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,230
The doctor was better and it went to the village.

169
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,440
“It was better”?

170
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,600
It could not better be.

171
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,790
There is currently no remedy which can cure it.

172
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,850
It is not true!

173
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,910
Look at that!

174
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,980
He ate some, it is for that he goes better now!

175
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,520
It is Amiudake!

176
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,790
It is a drug miracle!
Thus all is well!

177
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,260
The Doctor even said that it had found all his forces!

178
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,100
The Doctor said that I could become doctor!

179
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,010
What takes to you?!

180
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,320
Stupid reindeer!

181
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,610
This mushroom!

182
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,240
This mushroom…

183
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,350
is a mortal poison.

184
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,570
Once introduced, the victim has nothing any more but twelve hours to live.

185
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,250
It is thus that which he wanted to say, the imbecile.

186
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,070
It is impossible.

187
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,080
I looked in the book.

188
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,350
I lost the book…

189
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,230
But this mushroom can cure any disease!

190
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,740
This flag with the tête de mort enabled me to face all the diseases!

191
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,730
It is true!

192
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,970
On the photograph of Amiudake, there was a tête de mort!

193
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,430
The Doctor said that it was better!

194
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,310
He will not die!

195
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,990
YOU SUMMERS A LIAR!

196
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,860
Crush more quickly! Grouille!

197
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,330
I do not have a second to lose!

198
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,200
It was touched by your attention…

199
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,450
The sign of the tête de mort on the photograph wants to say that it is a poison.

200
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,230
It is a lie!

201
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,910
It is not a lie.

202
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,990
Now I listens!

203
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,050
There does not exist any drug in this world which can cure all the diseases!

204
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,960
Therefore there are doctors.

205
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,050
You lie…

206
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,990
Listen to me.

207
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,670
You cannot save the life of somebody, only with good will.

208
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,600
If you want to save a life, it is necessary you to have years of knowledge and practice.

209
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,540
You will never cure anybody in this way!

210
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,070
Poor imbecile…

211
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,400
Wapol-Sama.
Hiluluk moves towards the castle.

212
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,370
Perfect!

213
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,280
What a idiotic!

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,090
Did it lose the spirit?

215
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,120
Why does it come here?

216
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,420
It will not return in this house.

217
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,740
It decided that the castle would be its tomb.

218
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,600
Lead me near the patients!

219
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,780
I came to look after Isshi-20!

220
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,620
What?

221
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,890
Large cretin!

222
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,590
You still do not include/understand?

223
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,920
It is a trap!

224
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,790
Isshi-20 go very well, as you can note it!

225
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,080
You came here to die, Dr. Hiluluk.

226
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,550
Why did you come?

227
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,850
Guards, out of cheek!

228
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,660
What?

229
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,640
I am relieved.

230
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,850
Nobody is sick here.

231
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,990
I really thought that the country was in danger.

232
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,580
That to say if it is only…

233
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,880
I fell into the panel.

234
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,520
The best service than you can return to this country, it is to die!

235
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,820
Cut down it!

236
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,200
Ca is not used for nothing.

237
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,720
You cannot kill me.

238
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,350
Eh yes.

239
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,130
When do you believe that people die?

240
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,790
When a ball in full heart is drawn to them?

241
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,030
Not.

242
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,820
When they are reached of a terminal illness?

243
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,290
Not.

244
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,510
When they take a soup of champignons vénéneux?

245
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,800
Not!

246
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,430
They die when they… fall into the lapse of memory.

247
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,540
Even after my death, my dream will be carried out.

248
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,420
The ravaged heart of the people will be cured.

249
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,500
Why do you cry, Dalton?

250
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,560
You think… that it is the same thing for this country?

251
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,940
Will is needed.

252
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,410
Eh, eh, Dalton!
But good blood, why do you cry?

253
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,640
A monster soon will come here.

254
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,330
It is my son.

255
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,970
Made him not evil.

256
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,190
Do not worry you, Chopper.

257
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,160
Ca is not your mushroom which will be right of me…

258
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,640
It was really a formidable life!

259
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,460
So long, charlatan.

260
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,460
Thank you in you, Chopper!

261
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,160
He was made jump all alone!

262
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,820
What a cretin!

263
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,870
Good blood, what it is?!

264
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,530
A monster!

265
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,130
Cut down it!

266
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,540
DECREE!

267
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,160
Leave!

268
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,150
Leave from here immediately!

269
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,080
You cannot even beat me,

270
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,010
you do not have any chance against them!

271
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,760
If it is because he made fun of died of Hiluluk, I excuse myself some!

272
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,530
Your force will not be of any utility if you burst like a dog!

273
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,220
Would not be a sacrifice moreover for this country!

274
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,890
Please!

275
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,670
You it leashes to escape.

276
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,480
Silence!

277
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,430
You thus do not include/understand?!

278
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,940
The only man who tried to cure the evil which corroded this country has just died.

279
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,610
This doctor in the large heart which tried to save this country…

280
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,160
… whereas everyone had lowered the arms, died!

281
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,100
And which difference that can make that he died?

282
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,330
I saw the future of this country.

283
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,790
And it is chaos.

284
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,350
As long as we will remain here, the country will never be cured.

285
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,510
It does not matter where is the advance of our medical techniques!

286
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,550
It does not matter where are our research and our practice of medicine!

287
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,690
BECAUSE IT THERE NO REMEDY AGAINST STUPIDITY!

288
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,940
They is good, you finished?!

289
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,720
You really put to me in anger!

290
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,310
A doctor!

291
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,640
Teach to me medicine!

292
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,680
Please!

293
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,040
Made ego a doctor!

294
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,720
I want to cure people!

295
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,980
A doctor who can all cure!

296
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,730
A doctor who can even cure a country!

297
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,610
Because…

298
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,940
Because…!

299
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,840
There does not exist any disease in this world which doesnot can be cured!

300
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,170
Doctorine.

301
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,940
Call me like that.

302
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,710
I… will not die!

303
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
I must perpetuate his will!

304
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,250
And thus for six years, Tony-Kun has been at your sides.

305
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,850
Yes.

306
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,510
I taught him all that I knew.

307
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,140
Doctorine! Doctorine!

308
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,820
It is him!

309
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,420
I finally returned to the house!

310
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,160
Jamagushi = Large Ball

311
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,160
This dumb of Jamagushi!

312
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,980
And now, I will re-establish the kingdom of Drum!

313
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Doctorine! Come quickly!

314
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,260
Wapol is of return!

315
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,810
I see.

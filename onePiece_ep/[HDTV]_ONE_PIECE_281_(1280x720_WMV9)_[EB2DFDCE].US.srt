1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,250
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,150
The man who had acquired everything in this 
world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,890
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,570
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,500
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,220
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,010
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,330
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,450
Robin!

10
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,570
We'll save you no matter what!

11
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,820
The bridge is being lowered!

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,450
Robin, it must have been hard for you.

13
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,750
But you're not alone anymore.

14
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,850
You have us now!

15
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,260
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

16
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,310
We're nakama!

17
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,740
Who did you say your nakama is, Luffy?

18
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:46,700
Nami.

19
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,790
What did you come here for?

20
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,460
What are you saying?

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,220
You're my nakama, right?

22
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,150
I came to get you.

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,890
A complete nuisance.

24
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,850
Nami?

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,340
Nakama...

26
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,590
Don't make me laugh.

27
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,550
Isn't that just a pathetic group of helpless morons?

28
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,780
You really trashed this place.

29
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,090
Nami, what's wrong?

30
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,960
Nothing, I just came to take a break.

31
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,560
I don't know if I could take it if you broke the furniture every time you came to take a break.

32
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,810
If it was nothing, would you be looking at that treasure map?

33
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,800
Something happened that pissed me off, that's all.

34
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,080
Those guys, huh? Who are they anyway?

35
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,240
You met them?

36
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,930
Yeah, some guy who called himself captain.

37
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,270
Seemed like he was lying though.

38
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,930
I heard you were laughing and having a great time while you were traveling with them.

39
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,910
But I haven't seen you happy like that in years.

40
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,480
Talk to me. Who exactly are those guys?

41
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,510
Didn't you promise you could talk to me about anything?

42
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,470
I had intended...

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,490
...to totally forget about those guys.

44
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,020
I thought I had erased them from my heart.

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,230
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK OF YOUR NAKAMA!?

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,070
If it was possible, I wanted to stay with them forever...

47
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,930
I seriously thought that.

48
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,180
I see.

49
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,380
No wonder you had a fit.

50
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,740
For this girl to actually have someone come for her...

51
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,790
Nakama, huh?

52
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,490
To her,

53
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,650
that's the most...

54
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,150
...painful word.

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,730
What's wrong little girl?

56
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,600
Do you want me to return that village back to you that bad?

57
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,040
Then how about this? Why don't we make a deal?

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,300
A deal?

59
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,880
That's right...

60
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,930
If you can bring $100,000,000 to me,

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,870
then I'll set you and your village free.

62
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,200
Really?

63
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,960
Of course!

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,290
I would never break an agreement over money, even if I'd die.

65
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,240
I don't care how many years it takes, I'll keep my promise.

66
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,430
I'm definitely going to save up $100,000,000.

67
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,850
ARLONG!

68
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,760
Yo, what's wrong, my most prized map surveyor?

69
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,940
What's with that look on your face?

70
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,090
The Marines you sent took all of my money!

71
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,430
Didn't you say you'd never break a promise over money, even if you die?

72
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,200
DIDN'T YOU!? WHY!?

73
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,740
When did I ever break our promise?

74
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,500
Don't play innocent! You made a deal with those Marines-!

75
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,690
When did I ever break our promise?

76
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,920
Tell me.

77
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,190
Damn it!

78
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,650
Damn it! Damn it!

79
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,810
So, all your money was taken, right?

80
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,530
That was really unfortunate, wasn't it?

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
But, a promise is a promise!

82
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,880
Unless you bring $100,000,000 in front of my eyes,

83
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,760
I won't release the village.

84
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,550
You scum!

85
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,540
It's only $100,000,000!

86
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,140
All you have to do is start saving again!

87
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,000
Or would you rather escape from here?

88
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,910
However, if you escape, I'll kill everyone in Kokoyashi Village.

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,230
Nami, we all pretended not to know.

90
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,290
So when you ever wanted to escape from Arlong...

91
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,930
...our expectations wouldn't get in your way.

92
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,820
This is it!

93
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,760
Take your weapons! We're going to fight!

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,570
We already swore once not to throw away our lives!

95
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,890
No matter how bitter and degrading their abuse was,

96
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,260
as long as Nami was okay, we would continue to fight this battle of endurance!

97
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,700
But this is their answer!

98
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,470
Now that we've lost our only key to freedom, we have no hope to live for!

99
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,680
Furthermore!

100
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,440
We can't forgive those mermen for taking advantage of Nami's kindness!

101
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,540
Any objections!?

102
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Of course not! Let's go!

103
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,500
Wait! Everyone!

104
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,950
Nami.

105
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,300
Just a little bit...

106
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,880
Can you wait just a little bit longer?

107
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,950
I'm gonna work really hard,

108
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,400
and save up the money again.

109
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,370
It's easier this time.

110
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,870
I'm used to it now!

111
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,320
It's okay, there's nothing to worry about.

112
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,470
This is nothing compared to that other time...

113
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,840
I don't want anymore people to die!

114
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,110
Everybody! I'm okay.

115
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,250
I'm fine so...

116
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,140
That's enough, you know it's useless.

117
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,810
You fought enough by yourself with our lives on your back.

118
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,610
For you, being a part of their group

119
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,880
must have been more painful than being stabbed.

120
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,290
You fought well.

121
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,160
Gen-san...

122
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,620
Now keep going and leave this village from here.

123
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,070
Gen-san!

124
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,340
Do as he says, Nami.

125
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,830
But...!

126
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,630
Na-chan...

127
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,260
Nami...

128
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,930
You have street smarts, and also your dreams.

129
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,950
Nojiko! Everyone!

130
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,150
I won't let you go!

131
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,210
Stop it everyone!

132
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,260
I don't wanna see anymore people getting hurt by them!

133
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,940
You're gonna die!

134
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,000
We know.

135
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,350
It's useless. We've already decided with our hearts.

136
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,730
GET OUT OF THE WAY, NAMI!!

137
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,620
Let's go, everyone!

138
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,030
Even if we can't win, we'll show them our pride!

139
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,930
Arlong!

140
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,930
Arlong!

141
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,930
Arlong! Arlong!

142
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,160
Arlong!

143
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,160
Arlong!

144
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,160
Arlong!

145
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,160
Arlong! Arlong! Arlong!

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,470
Arl...

147
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:50,830
Luffy...

148
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,550
What?

149
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,710
You don't even know anything.

150
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,770
You don't know what this island has been through in the last eight years.

151
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
Yeah, I don't know.

152
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,700
This has nothing to do with you, so...

153
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,900
I told you to leave this island!

154
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,520
Yeah, you told me.

155
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,670
Get out of here!

156
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,810
You... Just get out of here! Get out! Get out!

157
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,760
Get out of here!

158
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,050
Get out of here!

159
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,280
Get out of here!

160
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,170
Get out of here...

161
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,820
Get out of here!!

162
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,180
Luffy...

163
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,630
Help me!

164
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,350
OF COURSE I WILL!!!

165
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,740
Don't touch my treasure!

166
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,910
Luffy...

167
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,800
Let's go!

168
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,110
Yeah!

169
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,110
Yeah!

170
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,110
Yeah!

171
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,570
What the...!?

172
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,530
Which one of you is Arlong?

173
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,110
There's no escaping now.

174
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,260
This is the top floor of Arlong Park.

175
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,030
What's up with this room?

176
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,120
Nothing but paper.

177
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,510
It's not just ordinary paper.

178
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,090
This room is for that woman to continue drawing me maps of the sea.

179
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,520
The cartography room...

180
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,570
Nami's room?

181
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,990
These are all...

182
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,550
...maps of the sea that Nami drew.

183
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,070
That woman is going to continue drawing sea maps.

184
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,410
All to fulfill my ambitions!

185
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,620
Then, when I have all the sea maps of the world,

186
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,060
we mermen will become invincible, and the whole world will be my empire!

187
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,590
The foothold of all of this is this island,

188
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,010
and East Blue as well.

189
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,900
Do you really think you could...

190
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,340
...use that woman so efficiently!?

191
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,830
USE!?

192
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,910
What's that!?

193
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,410
A desk?

194
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,240
What the hell are you doing!?

195
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,120
What the hell's going on?

196
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
What's with all that stuff flying out?

197
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,650
Stop it!!

198
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,900
The sea maps!

199
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,330
My sea maps!

200
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,230
It must be one hell of an intense battle.

201
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,860
Yeah, must be a fight to the death.

202
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,970
No doubt about it.

203
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,510
Thank you.

204
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,230
You've gone too far shitty rubber.

205
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,710
I don't know how great mermen are,

206
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,830
or about your sea maps,

207
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,330
or what's been going on here.

208
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,100
But now I finally know how to save her!

209
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,890
It's because this room exists.

210
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,730
A place she doesn't even want to be...

211
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm going to destroy it all!

212
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,480
Gomu Gomu no Axe!

213
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,750
It's gonna collapse!

214
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,280
Run! Everybody hurry and run!

215
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,200
Nami-aneki! Hurry!

216
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,550
But Luffy's still in there!

217
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:33,950
Aneki!

218
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,500
Luffy! Luffy is..!

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
LUFFY!!

220
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,240
Luffy...

221
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,500
Who won?

222
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,270
After collapsing like that...

223
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,910
Could he...?

224
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,540
Luffy...

225
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,230
Luffy!

226
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,850
ANIKI~!!

227
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,140
Is he alright?

228
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,950
NAMI!!

229
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,820
YOU ARE MY NAKAMA!!

230
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,020
Back then, I was saved by my nakama.

231
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,490
This time, I'm going to fight for my nakama.

232
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,640
So Robin, believe in us...

233
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,610
Believe in Luffy!

234
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,120
Luffy will be sure to answer you.

235
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,280
Oi, you pirates! What are you lingering around for?

236
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,430
What's the meaning of that smile?

237
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,320
HERE WE GO!!

238
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,800
Robin used to always be alone,

239
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,240
just like I used to be.

240
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,450
But we all met and became nakama.

241
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,450
You're no longer alone, Robin-chan.

242
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,720
That's right, Luffy and we are all with you now.

243
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,720
We won't let anyone else be a victim.

244
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,680
Wait for us, Robin!

245
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,450
We'll save you no matter what!

246
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,440
Next time, One Piece: A Farewell Improves a Man!
 Sanji and Chopper.

247
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,650
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,520
I...

21
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,450
I WILL STAY HERE...

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,210
But if we ever meet again,

23
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,590
Will you still call me your nakama?

24
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:41,290
Beware her scent!
The seventh one is Nico Robin!

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,470
Yes.

26
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,780
I sank one of the ships. The one belonging to the Baroque Works Agent, Bon Clay.

27
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,180
But the other one...

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,870
Come on, keep it moving.

29
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,810
So they got away?

30
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,260
I was swindled by a cheap trick.

31
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,140
They're pretty good at running away, huh?

32
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,230
Hina-jou, watch out!

33
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,910
Honestly. Pisses me off.

34
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,200
Hina pissed.

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,980
What, your ineptitude?

36
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,780
No. Not at all.

37
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,900
Ah! So hot!

38
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,950
The sheer power of the Ori Ori Fruit!

39
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,950
Ori - Cage

40
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,900
"Everthing that comes near me gets LOCKED UP!"

41
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,890
Say it!

42
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,660
The catchphrase! Say it!

43
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,450
What the hell is this!? Iron shackles!?

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,960
You piss me off, Smoker-kun.

45
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,190
I'm aware of a lot of things I do that piss you off.

46
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,830
But...

47
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,470
When I told you the Straw Hat Pirates escaped,

48
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,930
You almost sounded happy.

49
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,090
Ah. I did?

50
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,410
Why do you say that?

51
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,810
No idea.

52
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,150
And then, she said to me, in a ceremonial manner:

53
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,370
"I have something very important to tell you, Papa. No, Father."

54
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,440
And I thought, as the King of this country...

55
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,670
"It's hard to stop being called Papa."

56
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,040
What!? What's he talking about!?

57
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,860
I cannot accept your death.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,400
I cannot even shed tears.

59
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,490
Why is this, Pell?

60
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,030
FIRE! FIRE!

61
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,010
What is it, Toto-san?

62
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,360
You've been laughing ever since the speech ended!

63
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,470
Jeez, did those sandstorms screw your brain up that bad, old man?

64
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,200
It's a secret!

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,150
I'm not telling you!

66
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,250
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

67
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,170
Look after yourself, Luffy-kun!

68
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,900
Come visit Yuba and drink our water again someday!

69
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,950
Now, what are you guys doing?

70
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,550
Go dig the well!

71
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,110
I got it!

Hey, who was the Princess talking to anyway?

85
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,390
Dunno. It doesn't really matter though.

86
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,010
I was just so happy to hear Vivi-sama's speech!

87
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,230
We have to endure for her!

88
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,100
Yes, that's right!

89
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,070
Even us poor folk!

90
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,620
Like you're poor!

91
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,940
Just like we heard, Alubarna is on the verge of ruin.

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
Then, we should go there.

93
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,770
But we need to get Yuba back on its feet. It's the Hub of the West after all.

94
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,030
Gotta fix all the canals from the Sandora River too.

95
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,590
And the casino?

96
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,360
The place is closed.

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
Let's get going!

98
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,050
Yeah!

99
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,610
Why's he getting special treatment?

100
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,670
No idea.

101
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,550
But Vivi-sama said so. It can't be helped.

102
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,660
And I hear he wants to join the Super Spot-billed Duck Squad.

103
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,000
But he's a camel.

104
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,780
A camel, yeah.

105
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,250
Well, thank you. You took good care of me.

106
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,580
Well, aren't you an impatient one.

107
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,660
You should't even be moving with injuries like that.

108
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,500
Okay, see you.

109
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,260
You just understand this: Go straight to bed when you get home!

110
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,810
Yes, I understand.

111
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,710
Oh yeah, wait up.

112
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,040
You forgot this. Here.

113
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,920
Ah, thank you.

114
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,920
Anyhow, you've got to rest quietly. Understand?

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,040
Leave your work to someone else.

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,330
And eat a well-balanced, easy-to-digest meal three times a day--that's in the morning, noon and the evening-

117
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,680
Un, you've done more than enough.

118
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,540
Wow! Those guys are fast!

119
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,560
It's more like we're losing speed.

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,820
We're taking on water from the hole below deck.

121
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,540
If those guys don't do something, we won't make it!

122
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,290
Oi, Chopper!

123
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,830
Are there any boards left over there?

124
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,720
It's getting serious!

125
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,940
CHOPPER!!

126
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,180
There's only three ships.

127
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,660
Guess we'll have to fight 'em.

128
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,860
Yosh! Let's go!

129
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:58,880
WHAT THE HELL!?

130
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,330
Ah, those?

131
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,100
Usopp asked me to keep them in case we could use them for somthing.

132
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,070
THEY'RE IN THE WAY!

133
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,100
WE DON'T NEED THEM!

134
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,960
I'll chuck 'em.

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,920
All hands, battle positions!

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,840
We attack in full force as soon as we're broadside!

137
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,860
Yosh! Let's get 'em!

138
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,090
Huh?

139
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,230
Before it's too late...

140
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,990
Full speed outta here!

141
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,250
Now, Carue...

142
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,570
Let's go home, to Alubarna!

143
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,360
My adventure is over,

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,100
But now the challenge of restoring Arabasta lies before me.

145
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,820
Right now, Arabasta is like a small ship on the water, riddled with holes.

146
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,250
But, no matter what large waves should come,

147
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,840
We will never back down!

148
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,760
We'll keep pushing steadily ahead,

149
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,570
Without never losing our course!

150
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,060
Yes, just like that mysterious little boat...

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,980
We'll see them again someday, won't we, Carue?

152
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,860
Smoker-san?

153
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,920
Hey, little miss.

154
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,480
How are your legs feeling?

155
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
P-Please don't call me that.

156
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:18,910
Thank you...

157
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,240
I've seen their new bounties.

158
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,920
The numbers suit them.

159
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Do you know what his partner, the swordsman, did?

160
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,580
You mean Roronoa?

161
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,970
He took out 100 bounty hunters at Whiskey Peak,

162
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,170
And defeated Das Bones in Alubarna.

163
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,760
Das? The assassin?

164
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,700
That's the name we knew him by when he was a bounty hunter in West Blue.

165
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,200
But in Baroque Works, he was known as Mr. 1.

166
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,050
Well, it's impressive how many poweful and renowned figures Crocodile drew into his sphere.

167
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,530
But they all still lost.

168
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,740
We'll set out again and continue pursuing the Straw Hat Pirates.

169
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,580
Yes, Sir!

170
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,910
The Marines aren't chasing us anymore!

171
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,090
We shook them off, didn't we?

172
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,660
Hey now...

173
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,710
What's with the lifeless responses?

174
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,240
WE MISS HER!

175
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,870
Quit whining about it!

176
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,700
If you didn't want to leave her behind...

177
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,620
You should've just taken her by force!

178
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,140
Ah! You neanderthal!

179
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,090
You suck!

180
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,280
Marimo.

181
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,510
Santouryuu.

182
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,880
Santouryuu - Three swords

183
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,880
Wait, Luffy. "Santouryuu" isn't an insult.

184
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,950
Youtouryu.

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,950
Youtouryu - Four swords

186
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,520
No, you only added one!

187
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,730
Listen, You know natto, right?

188
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,730
natto - Fermented soy beans

189
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,510
That could mean, like "You stink", okay?

190
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,470
So we finally got away from the island.

191
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,260
Yeah.

192
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,510
Well done.

193
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,590
Here for revenge!? Bring it on!

194
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,400
Why are YOU here!?

195
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,680
Take cover!

196
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,790
Take cover!

197
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,450
Who is she?

198
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,630
It doesn't matter who she is!

199
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,810
She's a beautiful lady!

200
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,580
Don't point those dangerous things at me.

201
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,440
I told you that before, didn't I?

202
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,390
How long have you been on this ship?

203
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,850
The entire time.

204
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,730
These clothes are yours, aren't they?

205
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,580
I'm borrowing them.

206
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,670
What do you think you're doing, Baroque Works!?

207
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,970
Monkey D. Luffy.

208
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,130
You aren't forgetting what you did to me, are you?

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,030
LUFFY!

210
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,380
What the hell did you do to this beautiful lady!?

211
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,390
WHAT- DID- YOU- DO!?

212
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,390
Everyone please disembark the ship at once!

213
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
Oi, you!

214
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,210
Don't lie!

215
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,960
I didn't do anything!

216
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,420
Yes you did. You put me through some very excruciating treatment.

217
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,850
Take responsibility.

218
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,910
Who is that?

219
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,400
What's going on?

220
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,130
Get out of here! I'll call the Marines!

221
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,260
You'd better take responsibility!

222
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,190
"Excruciating treatment"!? What the hell did you do to her!?

223
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,130
What the hell did you do!?

224
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,260
Serious! Usopp is serious!

225
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,510
I don't know what you're talking about!

226
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,150
What do you want me to do!?

227
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,320
Allow me to join your nakama.

228
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,980
HUH!?

229
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,980
SURE! }

230
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,900
Hurry, use it.

231
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,010
It's the antidote for Crocodile's poison.

232
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,190
Even if he is buried beneath all this rubble, his rubber body may allow him to survive.

233
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,070
Back then you said...

234
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,740
...that only history was inscribed there.

235
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,520
Why did you lie?

236
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,580
You knew?

237
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,000
How naughty.

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,080
The history of this country is not inscribed on that stone.

239
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,960
All that is inscribed there are the details about the weapon your organization desired.

240
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,190
And of course, its location.

241
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,830
If you had translated it for Crocodile, this country would currently be his.

242
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,630
Am I wrong?

243
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm not interested.

244
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,720
I don't care whether people and countries live or die.

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,270
I couldn't care less.

246
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,850
I never intended to give Crocodile the weapon in the first place.

247
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,880
I don't understand.

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,380
Then why did you come here?

249
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,850
Hopes and expectations are two different things.

250
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,000
What I wanted to find was... the Rio Poneglyph.

251
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,660
Out of all the Poneglyphs existing in this world...

252
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,770
It is the one stone that tells the True History.

253
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,310
That is the Rio Poneglyph.

254
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,740
The True History?

255
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,480
What is that?

256
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,170
Enough.

257
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,530
I've searched for 20 years...

258
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,700
And this was the only lead I found.

259
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,580
This place was my last hope, and it was a failure.

260
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,410
If I am to die here, that suits me fine.

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,550
I'm tired of walking the road I followed here.

262
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,470
When all I want is to learn of a history,

263
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,280
There are too many enemies within my dream.

264
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,900
One further question, if I may...

265
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,860
Are you saying the threads of the history that cannot be told can be woven together?

266
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,810
And that Poneglyph is the record of it?

267
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,380
If that is so, then why have we been...?

268
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,110
Yosh, let's get out of here.

269
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,020
Wait a second!

270
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,280
I have no reason to live!

271
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,500
Put me down and leave!

272
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,250
Why the hell should I listen to you?

273
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,590
Back then, you forced me to live when I wished to die.

274
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,390
That is your crime.

275
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,490
I have no place to go or return to.

276
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,540
So, are you going to let me stay on your ship?

277
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,730
I get it.

278
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,280
Guess that's that.

279
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,930
Okay.

280
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,540
LUFFY!

281
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,540
LUFFY! 

282
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,950
Don't worry!

283
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,200
She's not a bad person!

284
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,630
Mellorine! Mello... 

285
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,900
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

286
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,480
I want you to answer all of my questions truthfully.

287
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,010
I'll ask you again.

288
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,290
Your full name...?

289
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,150
Oh, I'm Usopp. Nice to meet you. No, no, pleased to meet you.

290
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,650
Nico Robin.

291
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,020
Yosh! Nico Robin.

292
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,650
And what's your occupation?

293
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm an archaeologist.

294
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,290
Archaeologist!?

295
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,210
I'm from a long line of archaeologists.

296
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,900
I see. From a long line, eh?

297
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,320
What the hell is this?

298
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,220
And?

299
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,340
I became an archaeologist,

300
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,090
And then I became wanted by the World Government at the age of eight.

301
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,520
For the past 20 years, I've kept myself hidden from society.

302
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,540
Since you were eight?

303
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,260
And you were alone that entire time?

304
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,200
Not exactly.

305
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,090
A child can't survive on the ocean by herself.

306
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:33,040
Over the years, I worked for various villainous characters as a way of protecting myself...

307
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,250
...and achieving my goal.

308
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,490
That's the story.

309
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,630
And would you say Crocodile was just one of the those people?

310
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,260
I would.

311
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,180
In order to locate the Rio Poneglyph.

312
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,830
Rio?

313
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,140
It's given me a lot of experience in covert operations.

314
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,650
I would be an asset to you.

315
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,650
Hmm, you seem pretty confident about yourself.

316
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,800
What's your speciality?

317
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,340
Assassination. 

318
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,570
AH, LUFFY!

319
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,670
The interview has concluded that this woman is TOO DANGEROUS to hire!

320
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,910
LISTEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING, DAMN IT!

321
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,010
Pathetic.

322
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,650
Look how easily you let her walk all over you.

323
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,410
She was the Vice President of an enormous criminal organization until this very day.

324
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,430
Give me one good reason why we should let her join us.

325
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,330
You may have fooled these idiots, but it won't work on me!

326
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,060
If you ever try anything, I'm kicking you out.

327
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,050
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

328
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,860
By the way...

329
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,810
I brought along some of Crocodile's jewels.

330
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,130
OHH! I love you, Onee-sama! 

331
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,820
Oi, oi, oi, oi...

332
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,380
Nami's down!

333
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,870
That was dirty.

334
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,890
Everything's following right along with the enemy's pace.

335
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,710
Ah, love!

336
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,260
Floating love!

337
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,310
I am but driftwood laying my ebony-burned body down upon the flow.

338
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,750
Treasure...

339
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:09,150
Driftwood, struck by your beauty called thunder: I am sent straight along the flow.

340
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,140
Here is your snack.

341
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh, thank you.

342
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,750
That is without a doubt... that.

343
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,390
Yeah. He was a lost cause from the get-go.

344
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,250
And so...

345
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,960
The two of us are the last remaining bastions against her.

346
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,490
Yes, those weak-minded fools have failed us all.

347
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,370
Oi, Usopp!

348
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,340
Chopper!

349
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,710
Should I call you Robin-chwan? 

350
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,650
Or Robin-swan? 

351
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,130
I can't decide! 

352
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,880
Oh, which would you like?

353
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,530
Ah, this is such a joy~! 

354
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,480
She has a distinct, more mature beauty than Nami-san~! 

355
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,810
This is a nice ship.

356
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,620
Is it always as lively as this?

357
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah, this is it.

358
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,130
Oh?

359
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,020
This woman...

360
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,450
What's she plotting?

361
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,320
By the way, Miss Navigator.

362
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,820
Are we on course?

363
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,430
No problems in wind or weather!

364
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,890
Everything's fantastic, Robin-nee-san!

365
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,290
You DEFINITELY took those jewels!

366
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,280
Sanji!

367
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,460
Is it snack time yet?

368
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,650
Just wait one minute!

369
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,230
I'm hungry!

370
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,050
Me too! Me too! I'm hungry too!

371
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,510
My... grave?

372
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

373
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

374
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

375
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,290
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

376
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,210
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

377
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,470
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

378
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,890
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

379
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,150
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

380
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,360
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

381
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

382
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,080
Let's paint a story of the future

383
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,330
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

384
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

385
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

386
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,550
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

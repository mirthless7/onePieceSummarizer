1
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,560
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,850
The man who had acquired everything in this
 world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,590
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,790
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,280
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,470
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,960
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,470

10
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,610
Is Lucci that pigeon guy?

11
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,780
Yeah, that's right.

12
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,410
If that guy and Robin-chan are together,

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,700
then we should send Luffy ahead after them.

14
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,800
Luffy.

15
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,750
You go ahead and blast that pigeon guy away.

16
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,200
Let me go! Let me go!

17
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,420
Excluding Luffy, there are the six of us here.

18
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,700
From the five CP9 that are here,

19
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,480
we'll grab the five keys that can unlock Robin-chan's handcuffs,

20
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,470
then follow Luffy.

21
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,250
Yeah.

22
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,520
If Robin-kun crosses the gates, then everything is over!

23
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,080
Everything is a race against time!

24
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Losing is a waste of time!

25
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,280
Everyone must win, even if you die trying!

26
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,440
Yeah!

27
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,230
Do your best!!

28
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,910
Help isn't coming for you, Nico Robin.

29
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,210
First of all, they don't even know how to get to the Gates of Justice.

30
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,000
Come out!

31
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,710
Pigeon bastard!

32
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,810
CHAPAPAPAPAPAPAPAPA!!

33
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,750
I'm the gossip loving 'Silent Owl'.

34
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,750
Fukurou = Owl

35
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,440
Do you want my key?

36
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,470
Shit!

37
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,210
Not before I refill my cola!

38
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,090
Chapa.

39
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,890
YOYOI~!

40
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,720
You damn pirate~!

41
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,250
We finally meet, here in the hundredth year~!

42
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,330
I see, so you're afraid of me!

43
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,220
Someone's here!

44
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,970
How about here?!

45
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,850
Shit!

46
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,490
No one's here, either...

47
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,250
Please, relax and enjoy yourself.

48
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:44,710
The Power of The Devil's Fruit! Kaku and Jyabura's Transformation

49
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,090
Yo~!

50
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,940
Yoyoi!

51
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,640
Yoyoi~!

52
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,600
Now, now!

53
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,560
Prepare yourself!

54
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,950
Are you ready~?!

55
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,700
Prepare myself?

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,950
No matter how I look at it, he's not a good match.

57
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,700
Getting the key is my first priority.

58
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,560
Yo! Assassin!

59
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,790
Where's the key?

60
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,960
Since you asked...

61
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,190
Let me tell you~!

62
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,610
The key is...

63
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,680
Yes, yes?

64
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,840
The key is...?

65
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,760
The key is~...

66
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,920
Yes, yes!

67
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,060
And then?

68
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,830
The key is~...

69
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,980
Just tell me a bit more!

70
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,230
The key is right here~!

71
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,160
Oh~! My key is right here~!

72
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,960
Oh~! It's right here~!

73
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,660
He's so loud and troublesome.

74
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,120
That's not how you do it.

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,080
What?

76
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,480
Young lady.

77
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,160
In order to drink delicious tea, your water must be hotter.

78
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,220
The golden rule of making good tea is...

79
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,260
...to boil fresh water, and pour it into a warm-kept pot.

80
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,730
The standard is when you see bubbles starting to form.

81
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,990
By doing that,

82
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,800
the hot water circulates and allows the tea leaves to dance,

83
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,770
which then helps to bring out the aroma and color.

84
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,630
Then you must immediately cover the pot,

85
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,490
and let it steam for a minute.

86
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,030
Then pour the tea into cups that have also been kept warm.

87
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,330
Just the slightest attention to detail can change the flavor.

88
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,420
You sure know a lot.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,460
I'm a cook.

90
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,340
Thank you for letting me know.

91
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
e& So beautiful~! e&

92
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,490
This should be it.

93
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,680
I'm finally here.

94
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,690
I ended up going all up and down the stairs...

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,660
Robin!

96
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,110
Oi! Robin!

97
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,620
It's me~!

98
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,240
Robin!!

99
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,190
Where are you?!

100
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,380
Damn it...

101
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,810
Just as I thought, nobody's here.

102
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,210
Damn pigeon guy...

103
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,100
That's right!

104
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,090
I already know where they're headed.

105
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,420
So all I have to do is head towards the Gates of Justice too!

106
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,690
You have the keys to Robin's handcuffs, don't you?

107
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,780
You wanna hand them over before I kill you?

108
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,780
What a stupid question.

109
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,790
I was disappointed that I didn't get to see your true strength back at the Galley-La mansion.

110
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I never would've thought you pirates would make it out here either.

111
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,250
I'm a lot stronger than the last time we met.

112
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,680
Be careful.

113
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,510
That's for sure.

114
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,820
Your energy is overflowing.

115
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,450
Energy like that of a monster.

116
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,170
You're truly a terrifying man.

117
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,420
However...

118
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,310
My swordsmanship is the best in all of CP9.

119
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,930
Don't underestimate me.

120
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,310
Nitouryu, huh?

121
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,980
Nitouryu = Two Sword Technique

122
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,820
Rankyaku

123
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,100
Not quite...

124
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,340
Sorry, but I'm a Yontou.

125
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,640
Yontou = Four Swords

126
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,500
Not a problem!

127
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,580
Come to think of it, your whole body's a weapon, isn't it?!

128
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,950
Nanajyu Ni... (Seventy two)

129
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,540
Rankyaku

130
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,630
Pondo Ho! (Pound Wind)

131
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,000
Haku Rai (White Lightning)

132
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:36,840
Soru (Shave)

133
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,510
This is fun!

134
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,450
I don't have time for games.

135
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,220
Well, then you'll just have to kill me.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,870
Rankyaku. Run! (Break)

137
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,000
For him to be able to control this so freely...

138
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,830
Bastard...

139
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,570
Are you messing with me?!

140
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,320
No, I'm impressed.

141
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,760
But if you're in such a rush, then I'll show you...

142
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,080
Witness my new-found power.

143
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,350
Wh-What's this?

144
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,900
What the hell is  this room?

145
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,800
There's such a thing as too much gardening.

146
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,870
It's practically as though we're outside.

147
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,720
No, no, no!

148
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,080
That's beside the point, Robin's handcuffs come first.

149
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,130
That key!

150
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,360
Quietly...

151
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,840
Quiet...

152
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,680
There's nothing to ponder!

153
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,730
Just be cautious and quiet!

154
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,320
One step at a time, without making a peep.

155
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,680
That was close!

156
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,160
Okay, one more time.

157
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,790
If I just take it quietly,

158
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,790
and quietly run away,

159
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,960
then my purpose will be served.

160
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,380
I'll have an unwounded victory.

161
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,460
That's right, I'm...

162
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,720
I'm a Lucky King!

163
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,170
Hey, heart!

164
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,520
You're beating too loudly!

165
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,570
Stop that!

166
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,810
My heart stopped!

167
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,680
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

168
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,120
You can't stop now!

169
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,690
Oh yeah, times like this call for a heart massage!

170
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,080
That sure scared me...

171
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,500
Calm down. Just calm down!

172
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,850
Come on now!

173
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,600
I'm the sort of man who can get anything I want done!

174
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,280
Probably...

175
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm a man that can do anything...

176
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm a man that can do anything...

177
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,830
I'm a man that...

178
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,500
Wh-What? A bee?!

179
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,580
Don't come here! Oi!

180
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,420
Go away! Go!

181
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,060
What are you doing?!

182
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,480
The end of that hana isn't a flower!

183
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,530
It doesn't have any honey!

184
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,360
Hana = Nose/Flower

185
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,740
Go away!

186
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,660
I said go away!

187
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,610
Wh-What are you doing looking over here with that gleam in your eye?!

188
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,490
You... You wouldn't! Stop it!

189
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,320
Stop it! S-Stop! Stop!

190
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,370
My nose! My nose!

191
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,340
It hurts~!

192
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,130
Damn it!

193
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,730
I'm right back where I started.

194
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,420
But damn, he's still asleep.

195
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,450
He's one big sleepyhead.

196
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,190
If I do it without panicking, I can make it this time!

197
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Quietly...

198
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,000
Quietly...

199
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,920
Quietly, quietly...

200
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,250
Quietly...

201
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,610
Quietly...

202
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,070
Just a bit more...

203
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
Just a bit more.

204
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,650
Just a bit more~!

205
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,700
Th-This time it's a rooster?!

206
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,030
No good!

207
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,260
Why is a bird that's so far from being quiet here?!

208
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,660
This isn't good!

209
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,950
If he cries out, it's over!

210
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,120
If he cries out, he'll wake up and kill me!

211
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,790
Oi! What are you looking at me for?

212
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,260
Are you going to cry?

213
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,720
Is that it? Is it?!

214
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,560
Rooster-kun? Rooster-san? Rooster-sama?!

215
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,200
Please! I beg of you! Please don't cry!

216
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,770
Don't cry! Please stop!

217
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,610
There aren't any roosters who do that!!

218
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,400
Huh? So you're here, pirate?

219
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,410
Da-Damn you, rooster...

220
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,960
Well then, guess it's time to get wild.

221
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,670
Damn you, rooster...

222
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,930
H-He's strong...

223
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,660
So you're here!

224
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,270
The one who shot the Government's flag down.

225
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,660
You definitely have a good arm.

226
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,050
That was his first shot after he just got up?!

227
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,890
Sorry, sorry for that half-assed attack.

228
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,020
Sorry about that.

229
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,960
That hurt, didn't it?

230
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,730
But it's okay...

231
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,200
Despite the way I look, I don't like to torture.

232
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,900
A Devil Fruit?!

233
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,650
Inu = Dog

234
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,650
The Inu Inu Fruit. Model 'Wolf'.

235
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,070
All I have to do is cut your windpipe, and it'll be over.

236
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,770
If you're gonna die, there's no reason to suffer.

237
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,780
Isn't that right?

238
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,240
A wolf?!

239
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,580
Shit!

240
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,300
What's this? You wanna fight?

241
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,480
You don't look very strong...

242
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Wh-Whatever! I-I'm gonna do it!

243
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,950
Shut up!

244
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,720
I... I came here to help Robin!

245
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,060
The ceiling!

246
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,610
It's falling apart!

247
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,860
Oh, no!

248
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,600
I only meant to be half beast, but I became a full giraffe!

249
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,070
THERE'S A TALKING GIRAFFE FALLING DOWN!!

250
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,600
Kaku! Your new power is so hilarious!

251
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,620
A wolf?!

252
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,490
What is this place?! A zoo?!

253
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,090
Ushi = Cow (to which giraffes are related)

254
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,090
The Ushi Ushi Fruit! Model 'Giraffe'!

255
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,510
You poor bastard, having to be a giraffe-man for the rest of your life!

256
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,860
What's wrong with being a giraffe?!

257
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,600
I told you that I happen to like it!

258
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,520
That pigeon bastard was a leopard, wasn't he?

259
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,090
For them to have two more with Devil Fruit abilities...

260
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,360
Is this the type of organization that CP9 is?!

261
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,290
S-So he has the Devil Fruit ability of the Zoan type?

262
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,540
A werewolf and a giraffe-man?

263
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,480
We really bumped into some winners.

264
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,670
However, I've been saved since he came falling down with Zoro.

265
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll just go with the flow of two against two,

266
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,450
and just let him beat them both.

267
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,970
"I told you that I happen to like it!!"

268
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,200
I'm sure you would!

269
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,100
Giraffes are so cool, right?!

270
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,980
Wh-What exactly are you saying?!

271
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,570
But really, they have no sense of teamwork even though they're nakama.

272
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,940
What's that?

273
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,570
Looks like an open safe.

274
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,370
Could those weird handcuffs really be...?!

275
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,080
I told you not to laugh!

276
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,090
Oi, giraffe!

277
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,530
How long do you plan to keep arguing there?

278
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,710
I already told you I don't have time.

279
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,480
If you're okay like that,

280
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,300
then I'll just cut you the way you are.

281
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,800
You poor thing...

282
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,350
Don't underestimate the full destructive power of a giraffe.

283
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,730
Henkei Jinjyugata! (Transformation Half Man Half Beast Form)

284
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,740
I'll show you...

285
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,300
...my reborn powers.

286
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,960
You look like shit!

287
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,530
Gabeen = Sound Effect for a Dropped Jaw

288
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,980
Gabeen!

289
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,530
You! Did you just...?

290
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Wh-What a shallow thing for me to say...

291
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,550
This isn't good, the absurdity of all this made me slip my tongue.

292
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,050
Don't lose concentration. It will only dull the sword.

293
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,020
How long are you gonna keep laughing, Jyabura?!

294
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,600
So-Sorry.

295
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,900
I can't do it!

296
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,040
It's too hilarious.

297
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,920
Why the hell are all his body parts so square?

298
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,210
Wh-What the hell are these handcuffs?!

299
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,350
Whoops! I'm so sorry, Zoro-kun!

300
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,450
Oi! What's the meaning of this, you dumbass?!

301
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,010
Th-They're probably...

302
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,270
...the same Sea Stone handcuffs as Robin's.

303
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,920
Since both the enemies have Devil Fruit abilities,

304
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,150
I thought that if I cuffed them, they'd become weak.

305
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,630
Then why did you put them on me?!

306
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,560
You idiot!!

307
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,870
Bu-But...

308
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,070
That giraffe's face is so hilarious!

309
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,870
My hand slipped!

310
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,990
You're a 'square giraffe'!

311
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,370
No doubt!

312
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,270
Damn you! All of you!

313
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,620
Enjoy the fighting powers of the Devil Fruit's ability!

314
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,010
Rankyaku!

315
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,390
Wh-What the hell?! Something's coming!

316
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,520
Amane Dachi! (Rottating Cut!)

317
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,610
This is bad!

318
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Get down, Usopp!

319
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:20,890
No!

320
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,850
This is no time to be having tea!

321
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,110
Oh, that's too bad.

322
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,150
Are you in a hurry?

323
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
Robin-chan's life is on the line.

324
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,240
If you're gonna get in my way, there's no holding back just because you're a woman!

325
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,650
Then, it's okay that tea time is over?

326
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,080
Next time, One Piece: I Won't Kick You Even If I Die!
Sanji's Way of Chivalry.

327
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,710
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000

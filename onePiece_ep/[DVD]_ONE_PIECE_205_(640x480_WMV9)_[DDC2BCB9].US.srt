1
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,800
It seems to me that it was by here.

2
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,520
Found!

3
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,140
If all occurs as envisaged…

4
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,240
Luffy and the others must be on the way towards the dock with gold.

5
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,890
Forgiveness.

6
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,510
I had really forgotten.

7
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,670
I was worried so much at this time.

8
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,080
But one can use this Waver even on the sea blue.

9
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,090
Yosh! We dispatch! One turns over over there!

10
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,460
Sanji-kun, is clutched with me.

11
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,590
Good idea!

12
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,000
I am happy to be in life!

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,360
God, Buddha, I am grateful to you!

14
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,050
Ah… Yes, yes…

15
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,390
It does not matter, hurries to climb!

16
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,020
In this case, I will not deprive myself!

17
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,730
MORON!!

18
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,270
How you want that I lead like that?!

19
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,510
The demonstration of the love of Nami-san is so much… dynamic!

20
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,070
I cannot that to fall under the charm!

21
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,950
Go, one goes there!

22
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:55,460
Catch to them all in only one net!

23
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:55,460
The secret plan of Jonathon

24
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,920
It would be said well that one was made berner.

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,470
They dared all the same…

26
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,470
Me also, I would like to catch a fish as large as that one!

27
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,030
Stop your remarks without interest!

28
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,060
One opened this trunk with the danger of our life!

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,560
Since this flight of the chart, the Commander guessed that you would appear here undoubtedly.

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,810
Which person crafty one.

31
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,780
Now there is no more loophole.

32
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,170
Whore…!

33
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,360
Even if Zoro and Luffy are strong…

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,680
One would have can be to await Sanji and the others to force these doors to open outside…

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,410
Not.

36
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,620
Our presence must be announced.

37
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,500
All the reinforcements must hurry.

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,620
It is nothing any more but one matter of time.

39
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,960
Useless to wait longer.

40
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,300
Hein? If our gold is not there, 
one has only to seek it elsewhere.

41
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,800
As if it were easy to make.

42
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,020
One must fight all these types…

43
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,470
and to make jump all these armor-plated doors if one wants to flee from here!

44
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,810
And then?

45
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,970
It is true!

46
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,520
One will not deflate!

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
On the honor of Navarone,

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,020
we will demolish you!

49
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,600
Usopp Pinch!

50
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,020
[Pinch:Bad Posture]

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,020
They will launch the offensive….

52
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,120
It is the end, pirates of Straw hat.

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,180
Hein?

54
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,040
Konteriano?

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,250
As I expected it, you finally came in the chambre forte.

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,540
Who be you, good blood?!

57
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,710
What it takes to you to open the doors as good seems to you?!

58
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,880
You conceal!

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
I am the special inspector of the General headquarter.

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,420
The Lieutenant of Sheppard frigate!

61
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,010
With the authorization of the Commander, I direct the special regiment of the General headquarter.

62
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,180
I do not need you.

63
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,940
Do not intervene!

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,190
Hein? Euh….

65
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,790
I already saw it some share….

66
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,400
Ah! It is the type which was in the same cell as Usopp and Zoro!

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,940
What is this you ace to make the malignant one?

68
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,250
Yo, Konteriano! You ace successful to escape to you!

69
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,950
You have the air in form.

70
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,330
I owe you all a proud candle…

71
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,410
Be sure…

72
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,900
that I will return the similar one to you…

73
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,410
for all the services that you returned to me until now with the interests in premium!

74
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,490
Lieutenant Sheppard.

75
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,300
What y' has, just when that became interesting…

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,970
With if military low power, 
it is useless to try to apprehend them.

77
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,810
Do not underestimate them…

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,220
Close it! Close it! Close it! Close it!!

79
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,440
Mets not soldiers of the HQ and soldiers of the fortress of Navarone in the same bag!

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,420
We go éradiquer the pirates of Straw hat.

81
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,820
You have only to admire the spectacle.

82
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,920
Included/understood?

83
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,240
Yes…

84
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,390
You finished ace?

85
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,120
Would be patient! I will crush to you now!

86
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,450
Give it to me…

87
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:33,630
Yes!

88
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,500
It is what?

89
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,350
It is the last model of portable bazooka developed by the General headquarter of the Navy!

90
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,380
Greenhouses of the marine eagle baptized “Eagle launcher”!

91
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,470
Its fire power is equal to that of a battleship.

92
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,470
[Battleship:Navire de guerre]

93
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,390
WHAT?!

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,640
It was still brought back with a frightening machine.

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,100
And then?

96
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,670
Approaches!

97
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,740
If such is your request, I cannot refuse it to you!

98
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,100
Burst!

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,740
What?

100
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,570
Played well, Konteriano!

101
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,360
Lieutenant, it is with back, back!

102
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,110
Hum?

103
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,550
Is Ah, it thus that?

104
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,660
Oi!!

105
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,700
Close it! This time, I will arrive there!

106
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,570
Not, not! Not at this place!

107
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,200
Crowned Konteriano.

108
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,680
What did it come to make, this imbecile?

109
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,140
I am amazed by this special army at the General headquarter.

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,390
Go, on the way.

111
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,650
Yosh! Gold, gold!

112
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,360
He! Have-HAVE-await! He!

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,010
Dumbs of pirates of Straw hat!

114
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,930
This time, I…

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,730
CUSE Konteriano!

116
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,200
Do not let them escape!

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,910
Continue them!

118
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,030
Is He, where gold?

119
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,380
Me it of mande not to me!

120
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,500
The monitoring is narrower than I thought it.

121
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,630
Only with Nami-san in front of the sea in this romantic night…

122
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,520
It is the whore of better, Nami-san!

123
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,010
Sanji-kun…

124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,060
Whore of cheer, Nami-san!

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,060
Sanji-kun!

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,280
It is a whore of fantastic, Nami-san!

127
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,500
That has the candy taste!

128
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,140
Whore, Nami-s.

129
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,350
Sanji-kun! Close it with your “whores”.

130
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,760
It would be said that they know that we are still in bay,

131
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,660
but then, why do they remain motionless?

132
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,820
That intrigues me.

133
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,570
Let us find a place sure to re-examine our plan.

134
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,420
You believe that there exists a sure place in Navarone?

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,090
Of course!

136
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,140
With the canteen where I was with Sanji for example!

137
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,790
But it is there that all the Navy puffs out!

138
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,370
Nobody would go in a so dangerous place!

139
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,620
But wait a little…

140
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,380
it is what our enemies must also think…

141
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,210
Yosh! It is decided!

142
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,520
Let us eat!

143
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,340
It is not the moment!!

144
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,030
I am a true pirate from now on.

145
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,910
I progressed well.

146
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,020
I will protect this ship costs which costs.

147
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,140
I am a guy on whom one can count.

148
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,590
Chopper!

149
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,320
Nami, Sanji!

150
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,590
You are healthy and safe!

151
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,360
I did not at all only feel, the guy…!

152
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,250
Isn't Luffy and the others yet there?

153
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,220
Not, I assemble the guard all alone.

154
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,490
It is strange.

155
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,450
It perhaps arrived to them something…

156
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,110
And thus with our gold too?

157
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,950
Yes…

158
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,290
I will seek them!

159
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,210
It is the second part of our exit with Nami-san!

160
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,500
Again only!

161
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,790
Sanji, you also will keep the boat.

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,560
I have a favor to ask you…

163
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,010
It seems to me that the chambre forte is in this direction.

164
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,320
It is….

165
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,600
These foutus pirate of Straw hat fled in direction of the mountain.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,310
Towards the mountain!

167
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,650
You dispatch!

168
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,920
Do not trail!

169
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,030
Is all well, Lieutenant Sheppard?

170
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,270
Shit!

171
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,770
I was with two fingers to have them…

172
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,510
But it is not because they found a trunk empty which they will throw the sponge for as much.

173
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,180
We still have a chance!

174
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,720
Hein! Vacuum?!

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,800
Lastly, I knew well that something as that would arrive, I thus already worked out a plan of help if.

176
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,660
I never make errors!

177
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,610
The chambre forte was only one trap,

178
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,010
but then, where gold can be well?

179
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,850
GomuGomuNo Fansub

180
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:30,570
Gomu Gomu No

181
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,480
GomuGomuNo Fansub

182
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,040
I thought that it was some share in the corner…

183
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,320
He, He… a little serious!

184
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,470
I believe that I gourré myself!

185
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,080
You stays nevertheless over there presently.

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,870
The refectory is located further, here one is with the infirmary.

187
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,290
Chut!

188
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,790
There is somebody!

189
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,830
Dad, please do what I ask you.

190
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,880
Even if it is a request of my daughter, 
who would like to swallow such a disgusting trick?

191
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,510
But let us see it is a drug!

192
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,720
This voice…

193
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,470
It is the doctor who was used to us as hostage…

194
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,980
And its papounet!

195
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,090
Wasn't gold any more aboard ship?

196
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,550
Nor in the trunk.

197
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,770
All the same, which surprise
to learn that you were parents.

198
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,050
Doesn't Ossan, then that go extremely?

199
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,950
What? I have only to drink a mouthful of that, then to sleep and I will be immediately cured!

200
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,880
That always has was an effective remedy for me.

201
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,910
Out of the question! No drink is authorized in a private clinic!

202
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,350
Go, just a p' tite mouthful…

203
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,040
Not!

204
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,780
You are not very reconciling…

205
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,990
Ossan, you would make well listen to your daughter… finally the doctor!

206
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,300
How? Thus you show me your gratitude?

207
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,230
I helped you, and despite everything, you have the base to return to line the nose in my business!

208
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,480
You make a point so much of recovering your gold, species of long nose!

209
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,520
Of course, Ossan of the dock.

210
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,320
One is pirates!

211
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,260
It is true that, you worked hard to obtain this gold.

212
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,980
, Be held you quiet, Kobato!

213
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,610
One wants to make economies of them…

214
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,820
Economies?

215
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,220
It was decided all together, that once this gold converted into money, we would renovate our Merry.

216
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,540
Peuh! How if I were going to accept the words of a pirate!

217
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,900
I of insane that you believe in it or not!

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,510
It is what one decided between us.

219
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,490
That is not looked at!

220
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,910
What?!

221
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,410
Me, I believe you.

222
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:20,380
Because he said… ur house.

223
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,420
Their house, hein?

224
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,600
It is there.

225
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,090
It is a small turning.

226
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,390
But there are no soldiers and this way will carry out you towards the mountain without encumber.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,320
It is not a way… it is straightforwardly a cliff!

228
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,190
Well!

229
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,160
One will seek our gold, Ossan!

230
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,780
Thank you for all!

231
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,960
Of nothing!

232
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,790
To take the way…

233
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,790
Lastly, still sorry for the disturbance, Ossan!

234
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,660
Hello!

235
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,070
Wait!

236
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,290
What is there?

237
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,830
Our Commander adores fishing.

238
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,670
One would say well, it has just shown us his technique of door-fitting!

239
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,710
Gold is undoubtedly used as soft food of first choice to fish you.

240
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,050
In this case, it must have highlighted it well in a place.

241
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,970
A place well in obviousness…

242
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,850
A soft food?

243
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,100
Hurry to come!

244
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,130
O-Oui!

245
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,510
Dêpêche to join them.

246
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,130
Ouais…

247
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,100
Hello!

248
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,030
He, wait! Oh!

249
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,490
If these young people succeed in taking again their gold and escaping from here…

250
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,340
Navarone will be in a really annoying situation.

251
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,450
What took to me to help them…?

252
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,540
Finally, there were not time to revise our plan.

253
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,080
Shit!

254
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,540
Will one have to seek all the time while grinding like that?

255
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,530
What is there Zoro?

256
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,510
Not…

257
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,580
I believed to have heard something.

258
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,880
Is this an insect?

259
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,470
Probably my imagination…

260
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,050
Not, it is not your imagination.

261
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,760
That arrives by here.

262
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,890
Waver?

263
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,770
It is Nami!

264
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,570
Thus you re-examined Doctor Kobato.

265
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,730
We do not have any index of the place where gold is.

266
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,500
I want of ronquer…

267
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,530
One should not trail, the sun will not be long in rising.

268
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,710
And it will be then more difficult to move.

269
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,750
Say, has it another chambre forte there?

270
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,600
Even if there were one of them, it would be probably again a trap to attract us inside.

271
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,910
With the fact, presently Ossan said something to me on this subject…

272
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,030
A soft food history…

273
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,260
Hein? About what is it?

274
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,010
I did not seize well but, approximately, he said that…

275
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,620
Here, it is that, Usopp!

276
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:30,960
Hein?

277
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,300
It is that what?

278
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,670
A soft food to fish us.

279
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,590
In other words, gold is with one
clearly visible place for us.

280
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,940
Visible?

281
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,710
I wonder whether a quite visible place is in fact a place which one can provide.

282
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,140
Ah! I see.

283
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,150
What does that mean?

284
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,790
However in your opinion, which tries “to fish us” by hanging a soft food there?

285
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,820
The Commander de Navarone…

286
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,040
Exact, the fisherman is not other than the Commander de Navarone.

287
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,160
Then the soft food must be near the fisherman,

288
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,880
what brings us to a quite precise place.

289
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,800
Not! Impossible…!

290
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,510
Completely!

291
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,370
What does it take to you?

292
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,870
If I remember well, you said that you knew where was the room of the Commander.

293
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,730
Lead me over there!

294
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,060
Hein?

295
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,300
Yes.

296
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,880
Ok, I go there with Luffy.

297
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,860
Robin and the others, you direct towards bay,

298
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,610
Chopper and Sanji will come to seek you.

299
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,830
Will that go?

300
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,620
One can go up only to two on Waver…

301
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,920
Bah… obviously one will be made locate.

302
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,830
Such an amount of worse.

303
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,860
One goes there to full power!

304
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,790
Be ready for you?

305
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,750
Ouais! When you want!

306
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,920
One goes there!

307
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,630
I they appeared.

308
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,530
It is where?

309
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,470
Quickly, shows to me the way, Luffy!

310
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,560
It is in top! In top!

311
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,740
Where that in top?

312
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,400
Do not loupez them!

313
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,730
It is there!

314
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,110
Included/understood!

315
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,450
But what a good surprise!

316
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,830
Which is this machine?

317
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,870
It is him the Commander?

318
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,910
Ouais, it is Tonton Fortress!

319
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,320
I had not even imagined that you will use this alternative.

320
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,790
It is impressive!

321
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,860
It is a vehicle used in the sky.

322
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,720
There is only Nami which can lead it.

323
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,000
DO NOT SAY THAT TO HIM!!

324
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,350
Yes, sorry.

325
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,370
Young girl, it is the first time that I see you.

326
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,520
Welcome!

327
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,620
In connection with our coarse manners, if you were not pirates, I would have reserved warm welcome to you.

328
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,020
In fact, it is well damage.

329
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,910
You have the fine spirit and a certain notch.

330
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,240
However, even if you are daring, perhaps should think to you of anticipating a little.

331
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,180
This time, no soldier will be able to eat or disturb us…

332
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,620
Luffy with the Straw hat.

333
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,460
But before that, one cannot bite with the hook without soft food…

334
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,330
Hein?

335
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,290
Where is gold?

336
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,140
You some share in this part, isn't this hides it?

337
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,440
You could to at least show it us, not?

338
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,000
Ah, just there.

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,340
Right under our eyes!!?

340
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,340
Oh! Gold was found!

341
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,230
Nami, one finally found it!

342
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,020
It is not fake I hope…

343
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,660
I can affirm you that they are gold bels and goods.

344
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,020
You can check it…

345
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,400
Ouais, included/understood!

346
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,310
Luffy!

347
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,900
They is truths!

348
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,610
No the doubt, it is well our gold!

349
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,720
Yosh!

350
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,350
I take the whole!

351
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,280
Uncle Fortress, sorry for the disturbance!

352
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,540
Oh there! Not question of letting escape a catch which bites with the hook.

353
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Do not be violent one with the young girl.

354
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,340
Thank you for this attention.

355
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,210
Initially with the turn of Straw hat.

356
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,920
I all will burst you the mug!

357
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,930
Still this odd net!?

358
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,260
I have more fo-but this.

359
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,510
Hein? Kairouseki!

360
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,970
Straw hat captured!

361
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,540
It is perfect.

362
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,980
And now…

363
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,180
That fears, that fears! That to make, 
what to make? Does Y' have a means?

364
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,480
If these types are armed, there must well be a means!

365
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,400
It is cold.

366
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,700
It is hot.

367
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,910
Succeeded!

368
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,120
Is C-C' what?

369
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
A cloud?!

370
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,980
Today time is with the good shape.

371
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,930
The risks of downpour are of 0%.

372
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,630
But in certain areas, 
an enormous cumulonimbus will be formed!

373
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,840
Take guard with the loves at first sight!

374
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,470
What do play you, young girl?

375
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,130
Luffy!

376
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,650
Luffy!

377
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,940
Hold good!

378
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,820
Afflicted, Nami!

379
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,180
Dispatch, take our gold and goes up!

380
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,980
I have as a practice never not to let my catch slip by once I caught it…

381
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,210
I will catch them all in my net.

382
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,770
Then, Luffy?

383
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,180
You see the ship?

384
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,720
The weather is so dark that I have evil to see there.

385
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,190
Make blunder, Nami!

386
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,140
It is a ship of the Navy.

387
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,730
While looking at there more closely, it does not resemble a battleship…

388
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,150
Ah, they are there!

389
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,690
By here, Luffy!

390
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,490
Nami!!

391
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,370
Nami-swan!! You are healthy and safe!

392
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,050
You thus have just let escape the pirates from Straw hat who had been introduced on your premise.

393
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,880
They have even catch gold moreover…

394
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,920
You made a dishonourable error…

395
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,950
I will not let these individuals escape my influence so easily…

396
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,340
Lieutenant Sheppard.

397
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,850
Here that you start to play the bad losers.

398
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,660
Ah forgiveness!

399
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,850
What do you say some, Commander?

400
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,060
Remain quiet while I take the control of the operations.

401
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,520
Oh, I thought that you had of it already enough!

402
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,370
Presently it was only one negligible error.

403
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,490
And I already prepared a unit of destruction which will crush these pirates.

404
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,950
Oh, in this case, I am in a hurry that you make me a demonstration of your skill.

405
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,150
They is well you, the captain of the Painpiku ship?

406
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,660
The pirates certainly will appear in the neighborhoods of the gate.

407
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,470
Act according to the plan and wait until they are sufficiently close to run them!

408
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,130
Included/understood?

409
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,010
With your orders!

410
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,620
Captain!

411
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,630
We reached the place of ambush.

412
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,730
Yosh! Ensure you not to let pass the boat of the pirates!

413
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,350
We will launch a great offensive as soon as you locate it!

414
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,770
The preparations are perfectly in place.

415
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,770
Do we have to move towards a place raised to admire the spectacle?

416
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,550
If us profi…

417
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,780
Please not touch with that!

418
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,780
Do I can ask you a question?

419
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,740
If it is in connection with the manner of capturing the pirates, I can explain it to you without problem.

420
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,130
The unit of destruction of which you did speak is well Painpiku, hein?

421
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,210
It would be said well that there is another boat here…

422
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,510
What you known as? Is C-C' impossible!?

423
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,990
This battleship does not belong to Navarone.

424
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,010
Lastly, one cannot really regard it as a man-of-war.

425
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,720
C-C' is what this brothel?!

426
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,410
Captain!

427
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,890
A man-of-war… finally which resembles a navire de guerre approaches the back!

428
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,780
A ship of Navarone?

429
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,350
What do you want to say by “which resembles”?

430
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,860
How to say…

431
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,030
If that continues one will strike itself!

432
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,130
Stop! You stop!

433
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,160
Merry! Ahead!!

434
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
What! What…!?

435
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,480
Thank you to have opened the way to us!

436
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,580
One thus could arrive up to now in all peace.

437
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,040
All my gratitude!

438
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,940
Thank you well!

439
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,750
Do not let them escape!

440
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,650
Continue them!

441
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,510
It is not most alarming for the moment!

442
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:02,970
What!?

443
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,600
Im-impossible!

444
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,180
They sent Painpiku by the bottom…!

445
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,340
Dirtinesses of pirates of Straw hat!

446
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,390
If be not agitated!

447
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,060
They were made take, undoubtedly, in the net…

448
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,230
The net?

449
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,410
This evening with 9:00, sea of
Navarone will reveal its hooks.

450
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,760
There will be no loophole.

451
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,740
It will be the opening of curtain of the last trap!

452
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,170
Yosh!

453
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,530
This time, it is the exit!

454
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,500
And our gold was recovered!

455
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,630
It was done, one did it!

456
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,880
Go, one sinks illico towards the gate!

457
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,990
Ouais!

458
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:43,980
Ouais!

459
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,140
In Luffy with the Straw hat and its crew…

460
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:19,240
You fought well until now vis-a-vis the fortress of the Navy, G-8 division.

461
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,200
You had an iron will, but that finishes here.

462
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,030
Good, drop, pirate of Straw hat.

463
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,240
It y' still has a means!

464
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,850
Soon in One Part:

465
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,320
Good-bye, the fortress of the Navy!

466
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
The final battle towards the escape.

467
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,280
I will become the Lord of the Pirates!

468
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Good-bye, the fortress of the Navy!

469
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,000
The final battle towards the escape

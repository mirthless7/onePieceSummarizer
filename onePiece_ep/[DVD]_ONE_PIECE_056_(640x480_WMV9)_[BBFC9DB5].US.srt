1
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:01,710
The raid of Erik!

2
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:01,710
The great escape from the Gunkan island!

3
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,070
Yo! Apis, with which do you speak?

4
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,300
Not… Remain behind!

5
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,100
Lost Island?
The island which ran 1000 years ago?

6
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,880
According to what Ryuji says to me,
it should remake surface soon.

7
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,830
But he does not remember the localization of the island.

8
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,580
There are no indices in the old legend…

9
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,750
Ryuji lost all its force and
was separated from his/her companions.

10
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,530
I want to bring back it on his lieu de naissance at all costs.

11
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,560
Ryuji, you always say that.

12
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,260
If you turn over to the nest of the dragons,
you will find surely your force.

13
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,080
No matter what it arrives,
I will find it for you!

14
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,500
Good! In this case, I bring you to it!

15
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,310
In Lost Island!

16
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,730
Did Luffy, you listen?

17
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,710
She said that Lost Island had run in the ocean.

18
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,630
But legendary Sennenryu said it.

19
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
Lost Island must be some share!

20
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,400
An island which isn't on any chart?

21
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,140
Yes! Therefore let us go there we!

22
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,410
Ah it makes hot!

23
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,800
What is this… Still pirates?

24
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,640
He, the guy!
You should see that!

25
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,490
What did it occur?

26
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:27,180
And then… the 1201ème generation…

27
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,970
He always speaks…

28
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,580
He! You should listen to that…

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,810
Ok! I am upright!

30
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,620
What? It is already the morning?

31
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,020
The history of the old man was so long that
one fell asleep on the spot.

32
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,630
There are problems!

33
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,750
Bokuden-San!
Where is Apis?

34
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,060
What is there?

35
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,350
You are pirates? There is a fleet of the Navy which drops anchor in bay!

36
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,440
Not possible!
They would be still after Apis?

37
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,380
It is what the problem with this gamine?

38
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,080
He, everyone, come with me!

39
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,360
Yes, Nami-San!

40
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,740
Why?

41
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,810
Be satisfied to come!

42
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,260
And for the old croûton?

43
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,700
Hmm… Let us let it rest for the moment.

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,200
He, if Bokuden-San awakes say to him this:

45
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,620
“We will protect Apis.”

46
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,240
D… Of agreement.

47
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,190
Their boat wets with starboard!

48
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,810
Well! I want that a group accompanies me
to unload on the Gunkan island!

49
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,070
The others, seize their boat!

50
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,630
Hello, everyone!

51
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,790
As we said the Bokuden grandfather, here legendary Sennenryu.

52
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,360
Ouais! They is really too cool!

53
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Stop making as if it were the tien!

54
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,730
Thus when you approach Large Line,
you see similar things?

55
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,770
Eh well we saw monsters before,
but it is not one…

56
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,940
Es… Es you sure that he is tamed?

57
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,240
Yes! Times, it are a little senile!

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,710
If he thinks that you are food,
it will try to eat you!

59
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,350
Too much late…

60
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,440
Isn't that does not make badly?

61
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,530
You resemble a trout!

62
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,760
You will remain planted there?
Make leave to me!

63
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,250
Let us let it be made puff out.

64
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,560
Zoroooo…

65
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,310
You would not have, it will poison you!

66
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,110
The farm, cook charmer!

67
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,520
The Navy wants this Sennenryu.

68
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,440
The truth, it is that after having reflected there,

69
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,720
we decided to bring back Sennenryu on Lost Island.

70
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,730
You laugh?
The Navy is near!

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,550
It was already hard to be left there all alone,
but with such a large trick…

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,350
Ryuji wants to really return at his place!

73
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,240
Then…

74
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,500
And I bet that Luffy said:“Sure, I you
will bring back! “, or something of the kind…

75
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,410
Yes, I promised that it would be brought back.

76
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,940
But… we do not have any idea of the place where the island is!!

77
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,610
How will one make to go there??

78
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,580
They is good! That will go!

79
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,730
Not, that will not go!

80
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:44,360
I think that if Ryuji returns at his place, it will be better.

81
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,450
The animals have the instinct.

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,110
Sennenryu will be perhaps able to reveal us something.

83
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,550
Yes, let us find Lost Island!

84
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,420
But how…

85
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,690
Eh well, it will go in a way or another.

86
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,900
Zooorooo!

87
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,480
But what should we make with him?

88
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,120
The fact of reducing to him the mountain will draw the attention.

89
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,180
Initially, we need a carriage
to put Ryuji at it.

90
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,630
Super!

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,340
There is enough of it?

92
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,550
Ok!

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,510
Good… I suppose that I must help now.

94
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,130
You be a bootlicker!

95
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,020
That should go!

96
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,840
That should be perfect so that Ryuji settles above!

97
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,600
It is sure!

98
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,550
But… the Navy always wets in bay.

99
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,110
And for our boat?

100
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,220
It will arrive something!

101
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,270
Not, nothing will arrive.

102
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,150
One can fight them.

103
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,560
That does not seem to me badly!

104
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,460
Not, one cannot!
That would endanger Ryuji…

105
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,100
Let think to me of a means of transporting it over there.

106
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,420
But of course, the Vogue-Merry always wets in bay…

107
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,340
It is the invaluable gift of Kaya!
I will recover it!

108
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,990
They is too cool!

109
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,250
However… Zoro comes too!

110
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,090
Me?

111
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,570
Ok, one leaves you that!

112
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,120
And if we wait fallen the night?

113
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:58,940
Not!

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,610
Bring the boat close to this course which resembles the nose of Usopp.

115
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,910
He, you are right!
It is the nose of Usopp!

116
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,050
But what will you make?
If the boat is brought…

117
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,700
Do not worry you!
I do not think that they can find us here.

118
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,230
At all events, you dispatch!

119
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,470
Ohh, then now one must make quickly…

120
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,590
Sanji-Kun and Luffy, bring Ryuji in the carriage!

121
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:26,950
Ok!

122
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,060
Yes, Nami-San!

123
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,460
Old croûton! Say to me where this girl hiding place itself!

124
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,610
I am serious! Awake maintaining!

125
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,310
The war lasted until the 1201ème generation…

126
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,550
What do you tell?

127
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,290
Major!

128
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,220
Something seems to have left a trace in the back-yard!

129
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,680
Erik, which did you find?

130
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,680
I think that they are at the end of this trace.

131
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,340
They hide some share in the mountain.

132
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,910
Well! Let us start to seek!

133
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,330
For this reason one should have waited the night…

134
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,390
What do you make?

135
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,460
I go up.

136
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,830
Ahh ymoonnbuuuu!

137
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,830
(Ahh! They saw me!)

138
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,230
It is them!

139
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,000
You will not escape! Fire!

140
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,530
Zoro! Zoro!

141
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,110
There was another of their crew!

142
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,100
Stop! Stop immediately!

143
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,790
Halt or we draw!

144
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
What? They will strike us!

145
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,400
Zo… ro!!

146
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,440
They will strike us!!

147
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,620
All sails outside!

148
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,670
We will not manage to move in time!

149
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,510
Prepare you to continue them!

150
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,030
Yes!

151
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,170
Weigh the anchor!

152
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,810
All sails outside!

153
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,830
Follow the pirate boat!

154
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,510
Here they are!

155
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,670
Oh not, the Navy climbing the mountain!

156
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,600
Ah… they are a little advances some on what I hoped for…

157
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,560
But what will we make?

158
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,130
The calm one, of agreement?
We always have these deux-là.

159
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,610
When the Vogue-Merry passes opposite
course of the nose of Usopp, we will move.

160
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,280
Still this boy.

161
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,000
Is brothel, what it?

162
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,570
A monster!

163
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,230
And moreover, we found the elixir of eternal youth, Ryukotsu.

164
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,470
Do not move back!
Our main aim is Sennenryu!

165
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,510
We will surprise them and capture it in a flash.

166
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,330
Yes!

167
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,700
After all that, I always have this trick in the mouth!

168
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,690
Not, it is not finished yet!

169
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,430
Do not let them escape! Capture them!

170
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,900
Zoro Zoro Zoro Zoro Zoro Zoro!!
Pay attention to the veils!

171
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,120
I know it, cretin!

172
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,780
Make shit, they go quickly for a so large boat.

173
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,880
Not! Leave quiet Ryuji!

174
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,730
Apis!

175
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,090
Ryuji!

176
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,770
As I thought it, this small idiot knew Sennenryu.

177
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,340
However, I did not suspectais it to have met one of alive of them!

178
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,160
The girl is not important any more.

179
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,030
Now, our goal is the elixir of eternal youth!

180
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,290
Fire!

181
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,240
Stop!

182
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,340
Not well!!

183
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,880
How it has…

184
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,010
It has… the balls just…

185
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,700
Therefore, you have the capacity of a Fruit of the Demon.

186
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,840
It is that! I am a man-rubber band.

187
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,230
A man-rubber band?

188
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,370
A Fruit of the Demon?

189
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,770
About what does speak he?

190
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,860
Use your swords!
The balls do not have any effect on rubber.

191
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,610
Sanji-Kun?

192
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,900
Yes Nami-San!

193
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,370
And does that say Navy?

194
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,860
If you want that something is well done…

195
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:53,980
What is it?

196
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,670
A knife?

197
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,920
My name is Erik the Tornado,

198
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,360
a mercenary employed by the Admiral Nelson.

199
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,330
You do not interest me,
I am worried just about Sennenryu behind you.

200
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,950
If you resist to me, you will taste with the capacity
fruit Kama Kama d' Erik Kamaitachi.

201
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,950
Kamaitachi = the false razor

202
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,020
What does he want to say by Kama Kama?

203
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,140
You see, me also I have the capacity of a Fruit of the Demon.

204
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,930
Okama?

205
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,620
Maintaining what?

206
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,690
Maintaining what?

207
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,270
Nami! They is good?

208
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,290
Almost!

209
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,790
To be able to see the ocean of also far,
Nami-San is so brilliant!

210
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,760
Eh well, which they hurry.

211
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,090
He! You them leeks! You listen to me?

212
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
You is Erik the gay, it is that?

213
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
Okama = Gay

214
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,980
Not!!

215
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,020
Pas le Kama in Okama!
Kama Kama in Kamaitachi!

216
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,530
I joke.

217
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,140
You will regret having irritated me.

218
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,070
What?

219
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,080
I included/understood what he wanted to say by Kamaitachi!

220
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,000
The wind that I create is as sharpened as Meitou.

221
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,000
Meitou = Name of a katana

222
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,710
To tear somebody right through is a play of child.

223
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,010
Is it good now?

224
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,380
Not, not yet.

225
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,390
Now, you draw aside!

226
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,400
Leave Sennenryu.

227
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,150
Never!

228
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,350
My Kama kama No tsumojikaze…
You still want some?

229
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,300
One can go there, Nami-San?

230
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,220
Yes, they are in place!

231
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,400
One releases!
Sanji-Kun! Luffy!

232
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,490
Yes, Nami-San!

233
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,400
What?

234
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,960
We are there!

235
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,030
Nami-San, my catapult of love!

236
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
You will not escape!

237
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,470
You will not escape.

238
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,930
There is a rock on the way!

239
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,700
Luffy!

240
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,100
What is it that?

241
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,160
It is like that it goes!

242
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,060
Ball!

243
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,680
Thank you to have saved me!

244
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,600
She said to move vis-a-vis the point of the course it is that?

245
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,050
Yes.

246
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,490
To shit, that could become bad!

247
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,750
One would say…

248
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,080
It would be said that we do not have other choices only to beat us.

249
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,600
One goes there!

250
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,690
It was that their plan?

251
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,140
Eh well, impeccable result!

252
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,560
It rightly!

253
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,010
Continue this boat!

254
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:43,930
The mast is broken! One cannot move!

255
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,680
What do you say?

256
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,400
That should do it.

257
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,570
It was funny!

258
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,800
Really funny!

259
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,790
Does Apis, that go?

260
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,760
They is good, Luffy!
One leaves when you want.

261
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,070
On the way for Lost Island!!

262
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,020
And it is by where?

263
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,430
By there? Perhaps over there?

264
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,070
Will one leave oneself there?

265
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,570
One will see well.

266
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,150
It is not on any chart.

267
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,880
Nice Nami-San is so splendid!

268
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,790
Why me?

269
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,210
We arrive… Lost Island!!

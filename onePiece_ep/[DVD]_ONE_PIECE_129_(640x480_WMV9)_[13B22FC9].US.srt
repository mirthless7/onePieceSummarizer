1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,810
If you want to continue adventuring with us,

21
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,130
That will be the last chance you'll have to jump on board.

22
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,030
Hey, Carue...

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,760
What do you want to do?

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:15,300
Beginning is that day!
Vivi tells of her adventures!

25
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,200
Igaram? I'm...

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,670
...going to become the Pirate Queen!

27
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,220
VIVI-SAMAAA!

28
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,890
Oh, Igaram, good morning.

29
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,190
What's wrong? You're sweating all over.

30
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,410
Hey, hey!

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,670
Hubby, how dare you barge in here!

32
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,440
Vivi-sama is dressing!

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,990
Ah, that is- I mean...

34
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,540
Good morning.

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,730
Did you need something?

36
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,990
Ah- No...

37
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,360
Then get the blazes out of here, Hubby!

38
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,620
Maybe I'm over-thinking...

39
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,050
Oh, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,350
I didn't know you were there.

41
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,050
Good morning to you.

42
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,920
Yes, good morning.

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,800
My, Terracotta-san is a frightening woman, isn't she?

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,890
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING!?

45
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,900
Isn't this a little tight, Terracotta-san?

46
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,300
Clothing like this befits a princess of your stature!

47
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,770
The Square is already packed!

48
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,530
Really?

49
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,210
We informed them that your speech would commence at 10 o'clock.

50
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,220
But they were so eager to hear it, they came early.

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,120
Well, I can understand how they must feel.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
They've been waiting for your Coming of Age Ceremony for two years now.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,030
It was supposed to be held once you turned fourteen.

54
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,180
But I haven't really... done anything.

55
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,700
You don't have to say things like that.

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,890
Just show them how much you've grown. That will be enough.

57
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,380
The Coming of Age Ceremony is to celebrate your transition into adulthood.

58
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,850
And given the events that have happened,

59
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,290
Imagine how the King will feel.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,330
Ah, that reminds me...

61
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,390
Vivi-sama's speech will be broadcast through Den Den Mushi and loudspeakers.

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,350
All of Arabasra will be able to listen.

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,040
I'm certainly looking forward to it!

64
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,000
I've received word that a battle has begun in the harbor.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,960
I see...

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,120
Unfortunately, there is no longer anything we can do to aid them.

67
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,830
FIRE!

68
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,380
FIRE, FIRE!

69
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,010
DAMMIT! SHOOT YOUR CANNONBALLS AT US!

70
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,870
I CAN BOUNCE 'EM BACK!

71
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,240
Goodness! Stop joooking around~!

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,570
If they keep hitting the ship with these iron spears,

73
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,490
It's only a matter of time before we sink!

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,470
Here they come!

75
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,600
Oi! There's no way I can patch all these holes!

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,740
Hurry up and DO something you guys!

77
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,580
We can only protect one side at a time!

78
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,340
Going up against eight ships is too much!

79
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,040
Even when we're stronger in hand-to-hand combat...

80
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,630
Even if we rush them or retreat, they won't break their formation!

81
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,790
The Black Cage Corps: Black Spear Squadron!

82
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,890
You pipsqueaks won't beat us! Dorks!

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,870
Oi, Hypnotist!

84
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,250
I thought you were a pirate!

85
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,200
Shut up!

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,130
I have my own reasons for this!

87
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,100
I thinks I recognize that guy on the left...

88
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,570
It may as well have been 100 years since we last met!

89
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,900
That impudent, harrowing cook and his buddies...

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,690
This is the day you sink to your doom!

91
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,890
I've powered up, you see...

92
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,100
Now...

93
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,420
Look closely at this ring.

94
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,480
This is the day I prove to you that I ain't weird.

95
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,520
Oh my!

96
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,820
ONE TWO

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,750
JAN...

98
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,770
BROTHER!

99
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,240
Usopp! That was you!?

100
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,780
Awesome!

101
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,260
Y-YOSH! JUST AS I CALCULATED!

102
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,790
That's what I can do when you rely on me!

103
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,480
Nose-chan, amazing! Good going! 

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,870
Now the two ships to the south are gone!

105
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,340
Full speed in that direction~!

106
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,430
BON CLAY-SAMA, A PROBLEM!

107
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,640
WHAT IS IT!?

108
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,220
IT'S THE BLACK CAGE!

109
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,520
What's that?

110
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,970
Black Cage Hina! The Marine Headquarters Captain who patrols this area of the sea!

111
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,660
This is not good at all!

112
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,490
Let's get outta here super-quick!

113
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,480
Aye, Bon Clay-sama!

114
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,810
Looks like they've been weakened.

115
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,050
There is no ship that the Black Spear Squadron cannot bring down!

116
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,690
Don't get conceited.

117
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,920
Underestimating people will get you bitten in the end.

118
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,420
Once we get alongside their ship, you boys step back.

119
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,680
You'll only be in my way.

120
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,890
Hina annoyance.

121
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,600
Aye!

122
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,240
What the hell are you guys doing!?

123
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,700
Let's ruuun away!

124
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,010
If we exit to the south, we can escape with minimum damage!

125
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,760
If we stay like this, we'll be done in for sure!

126
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,010
If you want to go, then go.

127
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,140
We can't.

128
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,310
What do you mean you can't!?

129
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,760
BON CLAY-SAMA, PLEASE HURRY!

130
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,440
LET'S JUST ESCAPE ON OUR OWN!

131
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,050
We made a promise to be at the eastern harbor at noon.

132
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,900
There's no time to sail back.

133
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,120
We have to press forward.

134
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,210
Really, that's the silly-silliest thing I've ever heard!

135
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,750
What kind of treasure could possibly be there that's worth your lives!?

136
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,110
Go ahead and die then!

137
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,980
We're going to see a nakama.

138
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,590
F-For a... friend?

139
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,020
I'm coming in, Vivi.

140
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay. Come in.

141
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,660
Vivi, about the speech-

142
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,820
My! What a pleasant surprise!

143
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,130
I nearly mistook you for the former queen, Vivi-sama.

144
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,140
Oh my goodness...

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,830
Sit down, Papa.

146
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,520
No...

147
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,690
Father, Igaram.

148
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,530
I have something very important to tell you.

149
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,730
BON CLAY-SAMA!!

150
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Running away now would defy the way of Bon Clay!

151
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,450
Friends who risk their lives to see another friend...

152
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,930
Knowing that you have abandoned them...

153
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,060
WILL YOU ENJOY YOUR BREAKFAST TOMORROW MORNING!?

154
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,110
Listen up, boys.

155
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,940
And the Straw-chan team as well!

156
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,510
Pay heed to my words!

157
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,200
Hina-jou! The two ships have separated!

158
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,820
The duck ship is heading south!

159
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
The duck is the decoy, right?

160
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,400
No! In fact, the entire Straw Hat Crew is aboard the duck ship!

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,600
The sheep ship is the decoy!

162
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,450
Follow them! Resume battle formation at once!

163
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,820
Three minutes.

164
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,040
Prepare the bombardment!

165
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,830
Here we go!

166
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,020
FULL SPEED AHEAD!

167
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,300
Could the Straw Hat Luffy you're looking for possibly be me~?

168
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,790
Not a chance!

169
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,800
Hina-jou! The sheep ship is escaping to the east!

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,510
What!?

171
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,960
You fell for it~!

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,110
My boys and I are masters of disguise~!

173
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,370
As well as...

174
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,550
...Straw-chan's friends!

175
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,850
One may stray from the path of a man,

176
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,940
One may stray from the path of a woman,

177
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,250
But there is no straying from the path of a HUMAN!

178
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,380
}{\1c&HFF80FF&}All friends must scatter into the sky of truth, and blossom!

179
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,420
OKAMA WAY!

180
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,370
- by Bon Clay

181
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,670
BRING IT ON!

182
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Hina humiliated.

183
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,920
Bon-chan!

184
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,980
Bon-chan, we will...

185
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,170
...NEVER, EVER FORGET YOU GUYS!

186
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,680
Scatter upon the water's surface, and grow where you may,

187
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,560
My fellow blossoms.

188
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,960
And you don't know who the puppet master is!?

189
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,280
No. It is said to be a secret underground organization.

190
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,560
Not even the company employees know anything about their Boss's identity.

191
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,060
And they are the enemies of this country.

192
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,480
If even the members know nothing, obtaining information from the outside would be impossible.

193
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
Rather, an outside investigation would only endanger the country further.

194
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,210
But, we've caught their tail.

195
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,310
Yes...

196
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,910
Eh...

197
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,090
Eh!?

198
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,930
Igaram, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

199
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,610
N-No! Not at all!

200
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,510
E-Excuse me, I have to get back to work!

201
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,070
Igaram!

202
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,350
You must not! This is not a game!

203
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,580
That won't fix it, Igaram!

204
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,560
I can't let this happen!

205
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,830
Ah, here they come again!

206
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,340
GET OUT OF OUR WAY!

207
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,860
Look! It's Vivi-sama!

208
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,320
Oh, Vivi-sama!

209
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,650
Princess Vivi!

210
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,850
I can see her!

211
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,050
Vivi-sama!

212
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,740
Your Highness!

213
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,690
Oh, how she's grown!

214
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,600
Vivi-sama!

215
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,620
Princess Vivi!

216
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,460
Vivi-sama!

217
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,690
In that case, Vivi-sama...

218
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,040
Allow me to ask you one question.

219
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,130
It all began that day.

220
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,120
Have you made a resolution not to die?

221
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,340
I've had a little adventure.

222
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,030
Oi! The Princess's speech is starting!

223
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,950
I've been waiting.

224
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,880
She really is alive and well! Thank goodness!

225
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,890
The ceremony in Alubarna has started!

226
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,880
It's two hours late. I wonder what happened.

227
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,450
Well now,

228
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,080
I hope this doesn't turn into a riot.

229
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,150
Kohza! Hey, Kohza! Come outside!

230
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,780
Vivi-chan's speech is starting!

231
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,340
Those loudspeakers are at maximum volume already.

232
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,430
You can hear it from anywhere in town.

233
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,850
It began... as a journey across a dark sea, in search of despair.

234
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,970
Away from this country, the ocean was vast.

235
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,780
And the islands in it had power that was difficult to comprehend.

236
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,780
There were animals I'd never seen before.

237
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,990
And scenery I could never even dream of.

238
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,320
The music played by the waves... was sometimes peaceful.

239
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,030
Flowing calmly, enveloping all my smaller troubles.

240
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,770
And at other timers it was violent.

241
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,410
Laughing loudly, ripping delicate feelings asunder.

242
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,380
Amidst a dark, dark storm,

243
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,410
I suddenly came across a little ship.

244
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,180
The ship pushed my back, saying:

245
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,150
"Don't you see that light?"

246
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,370
Never losing its way in the darkness, that mysterious little ship...

247
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,410
...rode the mighty waves as if dancing upon them.

248
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,640
It never opposed the sea,

249
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,850
Yet the continued to point forward, even when the winds blew against it.

250
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,900
And then it pointed a finger.

251
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,110
"Look! There's the light!"

252
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,250
History will likely record this as an illusion.

253
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,120
But to me, it is the truth.

254
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,400
What's she talking about?

255
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,770
A secret battle with the Marines!

256
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,910
And then...

257
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,930
Vivi...

258
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,560
You heard that speech, right?

259
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,920
That was Vivi's voice.

260
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,430
It's the broadcast of that ceremony in Alubarna.

261
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,070
So it's settled. She ain't coming.

262
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,060
No! That only sounded like Vivi's voice!

263
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,790
She's definitely going to be at the place we promised, right?

264
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah. She is.

265
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,260
Let's go. It's past noon.

266
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,670
She has to be here!

267
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,140
Let's get off the ship and look! I know she's there!

268
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,380
Oi, we got problem!

269
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,210
The Marines are coming at us again!

270
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,400
Just how many damned ship do they have!?

271
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,140
Shit! We're moving on!

272
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,070
Turning to starboard!

273
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,010
Give it up, Luffy.

274
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,840
She's from a different world.

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,280
What does this mean?

276
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,880
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON!?

277
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,880
Oi, show us your face, you phony princess!

278
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,080
No! Captain Igaram!

279
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,180
Where's the real Vivi-sama!?

280
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,560
Where's the Princess giving her speech from!?

281
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,400
Vivi-sama is actually...

282
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,370
Good shot.

283
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,430
EVERYONE!!

284
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,680
VIVI!

285
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,810
CARUE!

286
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Vivi!

287
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,550
See, she's here!

288
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,770
VIVI-CHAN!

289
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,780
Turn the ship around! Hurry!

290
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,020
The Marines are almost here!

291
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,570
I'm here to say good-bye!

292
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,080
What'd she just...?

293
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,730
Carue, give me the receicer.

294
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,760
I... cannot go with you!

295
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you for everything!

296
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,390
Is she talking to someone?

297
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,040
Impossible. Is that the Princess of this country?

298
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,340
She should be at her ceremony in Alubarna.

299
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,790
I want to have more adventures, but...

300
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,060
I can't because...

301
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,260
I love my country!

302
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,250
Vivi-sama, where are you!?

303
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,350
Get outta here, Captain Igaram!

304
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,280
We didn't come here to see YOU!

305
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,850
Way to go, Captain Igaram!

306
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,970
Do some more!

307
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,250
We came here to see Vivi-sama!

308
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,770
That's why I cannot come with you!

309
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,330
Oh!

310
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,210
I...

311
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,720
The symbol should be an ×!

312
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,840
Why?

313
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,830
'Cause we're pirates!

314
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,700
But that means deaths to whoever sees it!

315
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,540
It's good. It should be an ×!

316
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,240
Right, Vivi? It's cool, huh?

317
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,090
Yes! I like that!

318
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,880
Whatever, just draw them!

319
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,650
That's not the point!

320
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,630
I...

321
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,830
I...

322
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,990
This is prefect!

323
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,840
I WILL STAY HERE...

324
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,650
This is proof that we're nakama!

325
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,220
But if we ever meet again,

326
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,750
Will you still call your nakama?

327
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,400
You hear that!?

328
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
Does the Princess have some sort of connection with the Straw Hat Pirates?

329
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,140
A princess the nakama of pirates? Impossible!

330
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,970
Anyti-!

331
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,800
BAKA!

332
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,670
DON'T ANSWER!

333
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,180
The Marines have seen Vivi already.

334
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,990
If they get any proof of Vivi's affiliation with us...

335
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,670
She'll become a criminal.

336
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,870
Let's just make this a silent farewell.

337
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,070
From now on, whatever happens,

338
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,980
This left arm is proof that we're nakama!

339
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,370
SET SAIL!

340
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,680
ARITTAKENO YUME WO KAKI ATSUME
 all our dreams,

341
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,500
SAGASHI MONO WO SAGASHI NI YUKU NO SA
re looking for...

342
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,810
ONE PIECE

343
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,330
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

344
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,250
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

345
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,510
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

346
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,930
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

347
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:36,190
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

348
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,400
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

349
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

350
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

351
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,120
Let's paint a story of the future

352
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,370
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

353
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,420
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

354
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,420
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

355
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,380
A never ending journey to be together.

356
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,380
A never ending journey to be together.

357
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,590
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

1
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:26,236
We're doomed! The pirates are coming!

2
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:29,072
Pirates are attacking the village!

3
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:31,274
Pirates! Pirates!

4
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:34,144
They are coming now!

5
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:36,980
Run for your lives!

6
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,182
Pirates!

7
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:42,882
Run for your lives!

8
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:46,949
(Episode 9) "Honorable
Liar? Captain Usopp"

9
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,086
(Episode 9) "Seigi no
Usotsuki? Captain Usopp"

10
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:56,087
<i>(Based on manga ch.23: "The Dread Captain Usopp"
ch.24: "The Lie Rejector" and ch.25: "Lies")</i>

11
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:03,139
We can't sail the Grand Line like this!

12
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:06,776
You are right.

13
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:09,543
I need some meat.

14
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,482
The only food supply is fruit.

15
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,451
We need some wine.

16
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:17,286
What are you talking about?

17
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:19,589
I am not talking about that.

18
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,727
I wanna find the Grand Line! But
it's the most dangerous place.

19
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:27,731
The most-successful pirates are
searching for the One Piece too.

20
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:30,267
Of course, they will sail the
most sturdiest ships there.

21
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,922
And also with a crew.

22
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,172
We have no crew, and
the boats' equipment...

23
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,042
...isn't completely safe.

24
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:42,612
We will have chefs
and musicians for sure.

25
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,378
Musician?

26
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,443
What an idiot.

27
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:52,856
There is a village a
little south of here.

28
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:57,274
If we can find a better
boat, it will be great.

29
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,930
And eat some meat.

30
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:01,631
They got fine wines there.

31
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:04,830
That's enough! Both of you!

32
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,473
The pirates are coming!

33
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:13,910
Pirates!

34
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:16,246
Everyone run!

35
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:19,980
Pirates are coming!

36
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,909
Pirates!

37
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:26,285
Damn them!

38
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,187
Pirates...

39
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,228
What pirates?

40
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,603
Just kidding!

41
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,078
You lying brat!

42
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,989
I'll teach you a lesson!

43
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,148
Stop right there!

44
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,811
Come here, you!

45
00:04:56,988 --> 00:05:00,490
Here they come!

46
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,532
Stop, you jerk!

47
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:07,325
Come and get me!

48
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:10,966
Come on and catch me!

49
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,689
Damn, we lost him again!

50
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,810
I hate that kid!

51
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:23,112
I will never forgive him.

52
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,344
Where the hell is he?

53
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:37,494
I have done a good thing today.

54
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:42,264
Just a little excitement for
this boring little village.

55
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,817
Found you!

56
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,321
Oh, it's you!

57
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:50,306
<i>(Usopp's name based on "Uso", Japanese for "liar",
and "Aesop", author of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf".)</i>

58
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,519
Captain Usopp's pirate
crew reporting for duty!

59
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:58,214
<i>(In Japanese, pepper is "piiman" and carrot is "ninjin".
The Viz manga names will be used here wherever possible.)</i>

60
00:05:58,215 --> 00:05:59,795
Where is Onion?

61
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:07,487
We're doomed! We're doomed!

62
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,393
We're doomed!

63
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:13,663
<i>(Onion is "tamanegi" in Japanese.)</i>

64
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,700
We're doomed! We're
doomed! We're doomed!

65
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,169
Pirates are coming!

66
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,539
It's from the north! It has
the Skull and Crossbones!

67
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,126
Liar!

68
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,566
It's true!

69
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,013
It is?

70
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,258
I saw it with my own eyes!

71
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,350
Gotta go!

72
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,295
- It's snack time!
- Dont run away!

73
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:44,156
I have a disease. If I don't
eat my snack on time, I will die.

74
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,563
Liar!

75
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:51,234
Captain, don't you
wanna be a real pirate?

76
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:54,569
Real pirates aren't
scared of other pirates!

77
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:58,630
It has the sign of Buggy the Clown!

78
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:02,707
Buggy's pirate crew!

79
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,449
I think I'll just...

80
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,816
It's only just two small boats!

81
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,922
And there's only about three people.

82
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:18,394
Prepare for action!
Let's defend our village!

83
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,161
Let's go! Follow me!

84
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,190
Okay!

85
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,696
It's been a long time
since we touched land!

86
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:35,413
Yay!

87
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:38,815
There is a village ahead, right?

88
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:42,708
It looks like a small village.

89
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:45,421
Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat!

90
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,290
There must be some
restaurants in the village!

91
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,247
Can you stop with the meat?

92
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:00,425
Watch out.

93
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:02,071
Someone's there.

94
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,146
Where is he? Where? Where?

95
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,201
Watch out!

96
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,760
Wow! Cool!

97
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,388
There is no time for that!

98
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:32,135
I am the king of the
villlage, Captain Usopp!

99
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,525
People also call me "Our captain."

100
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:37,614
Captain Usopp!

101
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,813
If you are trying to attack this
village, you better give up now!

102
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:48,818
My 80 million crew
won't let you do that!

103
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,799
I'm scared!

104
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,451
Oh brother.

105
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:56,260
Liar!

106
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,297
She saw right through me!

107
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:01,271
See, I knew it!

108
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,139
I didn't say anything!

109
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,773
What? Liar!

110
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:12,675
Nuts!

111
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,844
80 million is an exggeration.

112
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,961
But I have real loyal followers!

113
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,831
All three of them?

114
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,609
They are so hard to lie to!

115
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,462
Let's get out of here!

116
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:36,154
Hey, you three! Stop!

117
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:41,895
I have never seen a
pirate using a slingshot.

118
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:48,411
You are so funny!

119
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:49,565
Hey, don't tease me!

120
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:53,654
I am a very self-respecting person.

121
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:56,853
Because my self-respect is strong!

122
00:09:56,854 --> 00:10:01,271
That's why they call
me "Honorable Usopp".

123
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,773
You saw that, right?

124
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:12,064
My sling shot skill is better
than your gun shot skill!

125
00:10:12,303 --> 00:10:15,071
Since you have drawn your weapon...

126
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,843
...let's fight until one of us dies.

127
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,837
I am not joking.

128
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:34,697
Who you are dealing
with is a true pirate.

129
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:40,857
Since you have drawn your weapon...

130
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:43,098
...let's fight until one of us dies.

131
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:49,388
Who you are dealing
with is a true pirate.

132
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:20,962
Wow, I am so scared. He's a real pirate.

133
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,917
I didn't say it.

134
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,512
It was Shanks, who I
most respect, who said it.

135
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:38,581
You said Shanks?

136
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:42,563
You know Red-Haired
Shanks? That big pirate?

137
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:47,110
Yes. Your father is Yasopp, right?

138
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:03,862
Yasopp is my father.

139
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,002
But how did you know?

140
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:11,897
<i>("Meshi": Japanese
for "meals" or "food".)</i>

141
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:18,965
Delicious.

142
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,892
I once saw him when I was young.

143
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:25,989
My father was on Shanks' ship!

144
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:30,366
You look so like him, I was
thinking when I first saw you.

145
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,134
Really?

146
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:35,738
My father was on the famous ship?

147
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:37,340
I don't know if he is still there.

148
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,315
I think he is still on the ship.

149
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,810
But your father was a sureshot.

150
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:02,632
Cool!

151
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,330
That's nothing. I can shoot
an ant's whiskers at 50 paces.

152
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,276
Let me tell you, Luffy.

153
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:17,313
I have a son at your age called Usopp.

154
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,649
I have heared that so many times!
I don't wanna hear it again!

155
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,996
What did you say?

156
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:24,420
I haven't said it enough!

157
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:25,929
You'll listen, no matter
how many times I say it.

158
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,560
What a sad story. But I had no choice!

159
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,061
There is only one reason...

160
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:35,392
...which is that pirate
flag kept calling me!

161
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:46,842
Usopp.

162
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:50,846
You story is always the same and my ears
became allergic to the same old story.

163
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,875
Yasopp is a great pirate.

164
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:54,628
That's right.

165
00:14:55,452 --> 00:15:01,290
My father fought for his dream
without thinking about the future.

166
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,083
I am so proud of him.

167
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,670
Then it's easy to say...

168
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:11,358
Do you know anyone here with
a ship that I can borrow from?

169
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:15,705
You see, it's a small village.

170
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,941
Sorry I can't help you.

171
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:20,876
On the hill...

172
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,768
...there is a big mansion.

173
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,514
Is he your friend?

174
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,903
Can you ask him to offer the money?

175
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:30,125
No way!

176
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:36,092
I forgot -- I have
to do something.

177
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:41,097
I am the boss's good friend.
You just eat as much as you want.

178
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,362
Gotta go! Bye bye!

179
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,045
What's with him? He looked nervous.

180
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,012
You said you want to meet Usopp?

181
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,273
What is this all about?

182
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,604
Come on, it's no big deal.

183
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,260
I just want to talk with him.

184
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:26,042
Impossible.

185
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,143
That man is a big liar.

186
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,013
For a weak, unhealthy lady...

187
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:34,713
Usopp's story is too much. [Kaya] But...

188
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:39,555
Your deceased parents entrusted me...

189
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,387
...to protect Miss Kaya.

190
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,162
I put the medicine on the table.

191
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,964
Make sure you take it.

192
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,642
Stingy.

193
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,938
So stingy.

194
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,814
Absolutely not.

195
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:17,902
Sorry for disturbing you.

196
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,699
Usopp!

197
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,313
Hi. How come you are still sick?

198
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:29,405
Sorry.

199
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:33,676
I wanted to be hospitable to you,

200
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,012
but Klahadore wouldn't let
me, no matter what I said.

201
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:38,820
He isn't a bad guy.

202
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:43,295
Don't worry. I am a brave pirate.

203
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:48,457
Staying in a small
room makes me suffocate.

204
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,918
What's your adventure story today?

205
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:53,914
Well...

206
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:56,899
I'll tell you what happened
when I was 5 years old.

207
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,892
I fought with a goldfish
that lived in south seas.

208
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,160
Goldfish?

209
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:06,275
First of all, its poop was really huge.

210
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:10,942
I thought it was land and
I even moored my ship to it!

211
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,329
Is this the restaurant?

212
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,765
Yes, the pirates are inside.

213
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,133
We have to save him.

214
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:32,468
They're real savages.

215
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:34,236
He could have been
barbecued by the pirates.

216
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:36,539
Stupid, pirates don't eat human meat.

217
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:44,638
Listen to this.

218
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:50,818
This is gonna be the greatest battle
that Usopp's pirates have ever fought!

219
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:55,422
Usopp's pirates are here!

220
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:00,095
Who are they?

221
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,693
The captain isn't here!
- Is he...

222
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:07,503
Hey pirates!

223
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:10,139
What'd you do with our captain?

224
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,408
Where is he?

225
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,701
The meat is so good.

226
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:17,178
Meat?
- Did you guys...

227
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:22,585
What have you done to him?

228
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:25,511
Your captain...

229
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,853
We have eaten him up.

230
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:32,023
<i>("Onibara": Japanese for
a demon hag or witch.)</i>

231
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:34,198
Why are you looking at me?

232
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,061
Who told you to say that?

233
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:45,050
I am only kidding.

234
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:53,382
Wow! It's so big!

235
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,935
The captain has been gone
and I think he came here.

236
00:19:56,786 --> 00:19:59,044
What is he doing in there?

237
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,023
To tell lies.

238
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,658
That's not very nice!

239
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,456
No, I think it's really nice!

240
00:20:04,457 --> 00:20:06,191
Right?
- Really nice.

241
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:08,351
What do you mean?

242
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,736
Kaya, who lives in this
mansion, is very weak.

243
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:19,008
<i>And after her parents died,
she has been staying here.</i>

244
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,903
<i>No matter how rich she
is, she's always unhappy.</i>

245
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:28,584
And Captain Usopp uses his
best jokes to make her laugh.

246
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:31,954
The captain likes his work.

247
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:35,090
<i>You have never seen a
freak like this, have you?</i>

248
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:36,699
What? I think he is great.

249
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:42,131
I like how the captain's always nosy!

250
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,500
I like his cowardice!

251
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,175
I like his lies!

252
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,039
Is she better now?

253
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,614
A lot better.

254
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:52,975
OK!

255
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:56,011
Let's go ask her to give us a ship!

256
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,106
It's Usopp's way of making her better.

257
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,283
It's hard to get in there.

258
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:03,430
The guards are very tough.

259
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,644
What about Luffy?
- I'll go ask her!

260
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:08,692
What are you doing?

261
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:11,163
Gum
Gum --

262
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:15,498
Your arms are stretching!
- You monster!

263
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:19,888
Catapult!

264
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:31,748
Then we use the catapult to
bounce us into the air and escape.

265
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,430
What's that?

266
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,097
Yahoo!

267
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,010
That's a great way in!
- You're nuts!

268
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,499
Are you ok?

269
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,568
I am fine!

270
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,971
They all come here to
see what I have achieved.

271
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,712
The new members of Usopp's pirate crew.

272
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:00,643
We are not.

273
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,579
I need you to do me a favor.

274
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,298
A favor? Me?

275
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,538
Yes! We need a big ship...
- Hey you!

276
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:12,558
What are you doing here?

277
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:15,984
Klahadore.

278
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,757
What is the meaning of this?

279
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:22,258
How can you break in like this?

280
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:28,550
Who's he?

281
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:29,626
right now,

282
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,006
everyone is still unable
to grab the true dream

283
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:44,980
if the world ever changes

284
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:52,154
take me to myself
that never knew a thing

285
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:59,069
making sure that memories

286
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:05,332
won't fade away

287
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:14,076
What's wrong with that man?
He took me for a thief. I know!

288
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,879
We are only here for the ship.

289
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,814
Sounds like a thief, though.

290
00:24:18,815 --> 00:24:21,717
That wierdo looks like another one.

291
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:22,985
Who's he?

292
00:24:22,986 --> 00:24:26,722
Isn't that guy the
butler? What's going on?

293
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,190
Next "One Piece":

294
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:31,960
"The World's Strongest
Weirdo! Django the Hypnotist"

295
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:34,177
I want to be king of the pirates!

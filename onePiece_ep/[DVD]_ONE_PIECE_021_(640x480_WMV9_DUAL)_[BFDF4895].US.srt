One week, please!

26
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:07,993
Are you mocking me?

27
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:08,285

Are you mocking me?

31
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:13,498
If you'd just remove the bug,
then it wouId've been edible.

32

If you'd just remove the bug,

33
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:14,750

A customer who paid you money!

45
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,260
You think money...

46
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,055
will fill your stomach?

47
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:29,255

00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:30,755

Service, service and more service!

61
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,421
And the very foundation of service
is a heartfelt greeting.

62
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:03,799
Welcome, mere bastard.

63
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,717
Please, enjoy yourself.

00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:07,302
No entry for the poor.

Okay!

68
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:16,019
Ah... I feel much better.

69
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:17,938
Now, back to work...

00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:20,023

75
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:27,406
A customer!!

76
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:29,491
You're at it again, Sanji?

77
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:30,450
What're you doing to our customer?

78
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:30,951
What're you doing to our customer?

79
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:31,326
What're you doing to our customer?

80
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:31,869
What're you doing to our customer?

81
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,163
Isn't that a marine lieutenant?

82
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,585
Gotta problem, you crappy cook?

83
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,170
Don't talk to me that way!

84
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:43,505
A crappy cook like you has
no right to call me crappy!

85
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:43,881
A crappy cook like you has
no right to call me crappy!

86
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:44,673
A crappy cook like you has
no right to call me crappy!

87
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:46,800
A crappy cook like you has
no right to call me crappy!

88
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,011
To a restaurant, customers are everything!

89
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:52,806
Beating up our valuable customers,
what're you thinking?

90
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:54,474
Customer or not, it's no different.

91
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:54,716
Customer or not, it's no different.

92
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,103
This guy not only ruined our dishes,

93
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:00,147
he also insulted its chef!

94
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,612
That's why I thought I should teach him a lesson.

95
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,366
What kind of restaurant is this?

96
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:15,803
Do you treat all your customers this way?
How does it even stay in business?

97
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:17,247
I'll destroy it!

98
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,459
I'lI destroy your precious little restaurant.

99
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,336
I'll destroy it!

100
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:24,379
I'll contact my superiors right now!

101
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:29,176
I guess that means I can't let
you leave this place alive.

102
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:32,596
Stop it, Assistant Head Chef!

103
00:04:32,596 --> 00:04:34,097
Let go of me!

104
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,726
He started it!

105
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:39,561
Stop it! Stop fighting, Sanji!

106
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,103
Stop it! Stop fighting, Sanji!

107
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:41,939
Just who do you think you are?! Huh?!

108
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:42,189
Just who do you think you are?! Huh?!

109
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:42,606
Just who do you think you are?! Huh?!

110
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:43,607
Just who do you think you are?! Huh?!

111
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:44,608
Just who do you think you are?! Huh?!

112
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,076
What is it this time?

113
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:54,785
What happened?

114
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:55,536
What happened?

115
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,872
Man, that surprised me!

116
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,416
O-Owner? What's going on?

117
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,377
Damn it, see what you did?!

118
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,504
You broke my ceiling!

119
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:08,715
It's all your fault, boy!

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,300
You broke it yourself, old man!

121
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,676
You broke it yourself, old man!

122
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:11,301
What are you doing, Boss?!

123
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:11,969
What are you doing, Boss?!

124
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:12,302
What are you doing, Boss?!

125
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:12,636
What are you doing, Boss?!

126
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,347
Leave him and help us stop Sanji here!

127
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,683
Hey, Sanji!

128
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,688
Were you fighting in my restaurant
again, you ingrate?

129
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,356
Shut up, old fart!

130
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:27,317
What?! Who do you think you're talking to?!

131
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,779
You wanna destroy my restaurant?!

132
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,406
You insolent boy!

133
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,659
You're another one!

134
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,952
Get the hell outta here!

135
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:37,452
Get the hell outta here!

136
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:37,744
Get the hell outta here!

137
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,585
What's wrong with this restaurant?
Even the owner's gone nuts!

138
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,380
Just looking at them...

139
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:49,131
They're just like... just like a pirate gang.

140
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:49,631
They're just like... just like a pirate gang.

141
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,048
They're just like... just like a pirate gang.

142
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,175
They're just like... just like a pirate gang.

143
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,652
You got that?!

144
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:53,927
The customers are Gods!

145
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:54,177
The customers are Gods!

146
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:54,428
The customers are Gods!

147
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:54,678
The customers are Gods!

148
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:55,178
The customers are Gods!

149
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:59,349
Only the ones who can stand your cooking.

150
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,353
Patty, Sanji! If you wanna fight, don't
go doing it in front of our customers!

151
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:06,315
Are these people really chefs?

152
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,107
Are these people really chefs?

153
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:08,901
L-Lieutenant!

154
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,569
Lieutenant Fullbody!

155
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,615
We've got a problem!

156
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,701
This restaurant sure is lively.

157
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:21,079
The Pirate Krieg's man has escaped!

158
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:22,414
What?!

159
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:23,999
We thought he could've given us a lead on Krieg....

160
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,875
We thought he could've given us a lead on Krieg....

161
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,836
We've already lost seven of our men.

162
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,087
That's ridiculous!

163
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:32,799
When we got him three days ago,
he was about to starve to death!

164
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,469
And we haven't fed him yet, have we?

165
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:36,553
The d-dreaded Don Krieg Pirates?!

166
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:36,803
The d-dreaded Don Krieg Pirates?!

167
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:37,554
The d-dreaded Don Krieg Pirates?!

168
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:37,763
The d-dreaded Don Krieg Pirates?!

169
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,267
Isn't he supposedly the most powerful
pirate of the East BIue?

170
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:45,938
I'm reaIly sor...

171
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,869
Another customer has arrived.

172
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:04,540
He'd better not cause anymore
trouble in my restaurant.

173
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:06,375
A pirate, eh?

174
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,683
I don't care what it is..

175
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,183
Bring me some food.

176
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,479
This is a restaurant, isn't it?

177
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:27,563
This is a restaurant, isn't it?

178
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,982
Welcome, mere bastard.

179
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:34,194
I'll only say it once more, so listen up.

180
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,696
Bring me some food.

181
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,698
He's gonna kill that cook!

182
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,784
I'm sorry Sir, but we'll be expecting
you to pay for a meal here.

183
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,494
Do you have enough money?

184
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,151
Is a bullet okay?

185
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,868
So I take it that you don't have any money.

186
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:51,670
What?!

187
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,172
Why that Patty bastard broke one of my chairs!

188
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:55,674
Wow, what power!

189
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:01,263
If you can't pay up, you can't eat.

190
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,882
Way to go, Mr. Cook!

191
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,893
That pirate's nothing. Take him out, Patty-san!

192
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:11,189
Oh, your stomach's growling there, you filthy pirate.

193
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,608
That was a fart.

194
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:16,320
You jerk, hurry and get me something to eat.

195
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:19,573
You're no customer, so get the hell outta here!!!

196
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,966
I can't take it anymore..!

197
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:40,302
I don't want anything to do
with this kind of restaurant!

198
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:43,430
I-I'll never come here again!

199
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,355
Alright, everybody!

200
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,774
Please, continue with your meal.

201
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:00,113
Please get lost.

202
00:09:04,969 --> 00:09:06,119
Damn him...

203
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:07,329
How dare he...

204
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,164
I wouldn't normally let anyone
get away with that crap...

205
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:11,458
I wouldn't normally let anyone
get away with that crap...

206
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,879
Hey, you're starving, aren't you?

207
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:17,506
S-shut up..

208
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,133
I'm the least bit hungry.

209
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:32,437
Eat it.

210
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,442
Shut up! Go away!

211
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:39,695
This is worse.

212
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:41,989
I won't accept charity.

213
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,283
Take it away!

214
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,495
Don't be so tough, just eat it already.

215
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,957
To me, any hungry person's a customer.

216
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,085
I... I can't pay for it.

217
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,761
The vast ocean can be very cruel.

218
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:10,267
It's awful to not have any food or water.

219
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:12,769
Just awful...

220
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,858
I understand starving people more than anyone.

221
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:21,686
I don't care if you wanna die with dignity.

222
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,824
But if you eat up, you'd be able to look
forward to a new tomorrow, won't you?

223
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:25,991
But if you eat up' you'd be able to Iook
forward to a new tomorrow, won't you?

224
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:40,589
This is so delicious.

225
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:45,469
So delicious. It's too delicious!

226
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:46,845
I thought I was gonna die.

227
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,847
I thought I was a goner.

228
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,979
Yummy, so delicious.

229
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,816
I've never had such a good meal in my whole Iife.

230
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,198
You like it, eh?

231
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,160
Well now, I've found my cook!

232
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,080
Hey, aren't you lucky?

233
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,957
If he hadn't given you something to eat,

234
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,918
It'd be all over for you by now.

235
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:21,296
Hey, Mr. Cook, care to join us?

236
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,092
You'll be the chef on our pirate ship!

237
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:31,323
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

238
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:38,372
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

239
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,952
You're a pirate?

240
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:44,720
Yup!

241
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,041
Then why did you attack this restaurant?

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,293
That was an accident!

243
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,212
We were just defending ourselves.

244
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:54,480
The hell does that mean?

245
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:59,176
Anyways, you'd better not do
anything else to this place.

246
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,639
The head chef here was once a
chef on a notorious pirate ship.

247
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,351
Heh? So that old man was a pirate?

248
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,312
For that old fart,

249
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:13,248
this restaurant is worth more than any treasure.

250
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:21,198
And those cooks who came after his
fame were once fierce pirates.

251
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:27,287
Well, the pirates in these parts
often come to this place.

252
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,541
Yeah, this place never seems to have a duIl moment.

253
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,377
It's not bad. I'm used to it.

254
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,298
Recently, most of the people only come
to watch the cooks and pirates brawl.

255
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:44,179
But thanks to that, it scares away
alI of the part-time waiters.

256
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,140
Oh, that explains it.

257
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,892
No wonder he wants me to
work here for a whole year.

258
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,770
Hey, join us!

259
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,272
I refuse.

260
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:57,818
I have my reasons why I must remain here.

261
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,695
No! I refuse!

262
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,530
A-About what?

263
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,658
I refuse your refusal.

264
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,370
You're a good cook, so come
with me and be a pirate!

265
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,582
Hey now, you Iisten to me!

266
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,100
So, what's the reason?

267
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,169
I don't need to tell you!

268
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:18,255
Eh? Didn't you say you wanted me to listen to you?

269
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,217
I meant that you must accept my decision!

270
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,346
You'd better watch out or I'll gut you
like a fish, you straw hat bastard!

271
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,263
What did you say?!

272
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,892
Don't you dare insult my hat unless
you're picking a fight, you bastard!

273
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,561
Sorry to interrupt, but...

274
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:33,771
What is it?!

275
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,441
I'm part of the Krieg Pirates crew. The name's Gin.

276
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,943
So, you're a pirate too, eh?

277
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,196
What's your goal?

278
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,656
I'm looking for One Piece!

279
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,575
I'm headed for the Grand Line.

280
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,248
You're still looking for a cook...

281
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,168
Your crew must be quite smalI.

282
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,379
Yeah. We've got five, counting him.

283
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,464
Why the hell are you counting me in?!

284
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,884
You look like a decent guy, so let
me give you a piece of advice.

285
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,259
You look like a decent guy, so let
me give you a piece of advice.

286
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,553
You'd better not go to the Grand Line.

287
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,722
You're still young.

288
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,282
There's no need to rush.

289
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,019
The Grand Line is only a small part
of the world's vast oceans.

290
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,815
If you wanna be a pirate, there are
many Iess intimidating places.

291
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,275
Oh, I see.

292
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,946
So, do you know anything about the Grand Line?

293
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,906
Nope, I don't know anything about it...

294
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,991
Nothing, nothing at all.

295
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:30,119
That's why it's so scary.

296
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,164
Are you really one of the dreaded Krieg's men?

297
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,457
I didn't think he'd hire such chickens.

298
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,251
Krieg?

299
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,970
Table 3's fried rice is ready!

300
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,472
You take it! There's no waiter.

301
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,020
You sure we'll be okay, Patty?

302
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:00,315
The guy you punched in the restaurant a while ago...

303
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,985
Isn't he one of Krieg's men?

304
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,779
Yeah, at least that's what I heard.

305
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,948
Don't forget his captain, Don Krieg.

306
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,994
He's supposedIy the greatest pirate in the world!

307
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:12,995
Yup, that's true.

308
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:24,882
He has a total of 50 pirate ships under his helm.

309
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,679
He's a monster.

310
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,181
So what?

311
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,936
He's got more than 5000 people
under his command.

312
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,358
What if that guy...

313
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:47,363
tells Don Krieg what had happened here just now...

314
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,491
It'd be Iike an elephant stepping on an ant.

315
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,033
It'd be like an elephant stepping on an ant.

316
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,370
He'd blow this restaurant to smithereens.

317
00:15:56,955 --> 00:16:01,835
So you mean, I should've let him eat for free?

318
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,381
That'd be unfair to the other guests.

319
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,428
That'd bring disgrace on the Baratie name!

320
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,348
And it'd also bring shame to alI us ''warrior chefs''!

321
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:14,973
And it'd also bring shame to all us ''warrior chefs''!

322
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:20,562
How many pirates do you think
we've beaten up 'til now?

323
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,107
If you're so scared, then you're better off quitting!

324
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,233
What did ye say?

325
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:28,404
Your attitude's the reason why
we lost all of our waiters!

326
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:29,405
Patty!

327
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,032
It's all your fault we're so understaffed!

328
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,702
Well, they were all cowards.

329
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,287
We didn't need 'em anyway.

330
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,331
Come on! Let's get it on!

331
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,084
Kick his ass. Fight!

332
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,503
Hey, you morons!

333
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,422
Get back to work!

334
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,424
Right away, Owner!

335
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,301
Later then.

336
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,388
I'm still going to the Grand Line.

337
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,014
Yeah, do what you want.

338
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:00,519
We're strangers, so I've got no right stopping you.

339
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,480
I just thought that I should warn you.

340
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,482
Oh, and Sanji-san...

341
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,526
Thank you very much.

342
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,320
You saved my life.

343
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,531
The fried rice was the best!

344
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:14,975
Can I come again?

345
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,744
Anytime!

346
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,204
Hey there, waiter boy!

347
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,156
Ah! It's the old man!

348
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,541
So here you are!

349
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,173
Get going, Gin.

350
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,425
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,679
You're gonna get in trouble
for letting me eat for free.

352
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,681
Whatever.

353
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,235
They don't have any proof now, do they?

354
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,872
Don't get caught again, Gin!

355
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,625
Thank you, Sanji-san.

356
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,419
I won't forget this...

357
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,091
Sanji! Waiter boy!

358
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,176
Get back to work, right now!

359
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,015
Table 3's ready!

360
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,895
I'm Luffy!

361
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,897
As of today, I'lI be your new waiter!

362
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,399
Nice to meet ya!

363
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,873
Isn't table 6's dessert ready yet?

364
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,585
Who's in charge of it?

365
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,462
Wasn't it you?!

366
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,798
I'm busy as it is!

367
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,174
Yeah, 'coz you didn't pay any attention!

368
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,552
What did ye say? You wanna fight?

369
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:02,433
If you're just sitting around,
GO WASH THE DISHES!!!

370
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:02,808
If you're just sitting around,
GO WASH THE DISHES!!!

371
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,267
If you're just sitting around,
GO WASH THE DISHES!!!

372
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:04,852
Where is that Sanji bastard?

373
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,287
He's out there entertaining the guests.

374
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,355
Again?!

375
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:13,777
It pisses me off that he's the assistant head chef.

376
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,696
What can we do about it?

377
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,490
He's been here longer than anybody else.

378
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,662
Do you know why Sanji stays, even though
he doesn't get along with the boss?

379
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
'Coz he wants to be the Head Chef?

380
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,667
So, you knew.

381
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,675
Hey, waiter boy!

382
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,262
How many dishes have you broken?!

383
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,431
Sorry, I forgot to count.

384
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:46,393
That's not how you apologize for breakin 'em!

385
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,855
Forget about the dishes, go clean up over there!

386
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,814
Yosh! Leave it to me!

387
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,069
Don't go eating that!

388
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:58,155
That's the main course!

389
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,990
Come on now, don't worry about it.

390
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,992
H-HOT!!!

391
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,329
HOT HOT HOT!!!

392
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,456
Get out of the kitchen!!

393
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:10,918
Listen up, you go serve the customers.

394
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,921
Go ask what they want.

395
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,105
Can you handle that?

396
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,884
It's so hard to do all these odd jobs.

397
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,844
I guess this is what Coby felt like, eh?

398
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,012
Hey there, waiter!

399
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,306
Hey! It's you guys!

400
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,934
Hey, I heard that you've gotta work here for a year!

401
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,311
Can I redraw the pirate flag?

402
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:31,647
What's all this?!

403
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,274
You all stuff yourselves with such
great food while I'm not around?!

404
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,734
That hurts!

405
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,737
Not really, it's our free will.

406
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,657
Take that.

407
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:48,205
But I've gotta admit, the food here's great.

408
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,044
I feel kinda sorry for you.

409
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,089
You drink it!

410
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,218
Why'd you do that?

411
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,804
You, too! What were you trying to pull?

412
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:05,889
My stomach's aching!

413
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,315
Man, they're noisy...

414
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,652
Are those idiots his crew?

415
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,076
Pour it yourself.

416
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,679
O' Mother Ocean!

417
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:30,764
Thank you for arranging this encounter today!

418
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,500
Oh, my love!

419
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,128
Go on, laugh at me.

420
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,838
I, who can't bear torture.

421
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:43,010
As long as I'm with you, it matters
not if I'm a pirate or a devil...

422
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:44,762
My heart's ready as can be!

423
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,599
But, this is horrible!

424
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,769
There's such a great obstacle between us!

425
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:55,230
The obstacle is me, right?

426
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,482
Sanji.

427
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:57,900
The old fart!

428
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,610
This is just great.

429
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,738
Why don't you just run off and
be a pirate just like them.

430
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,867
We don't need you here anymore!

431
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,759
I see.

432
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:27,596
So that cook saved your life.

433
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:29,723
And you were able to return.

434
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,227
Isn't that so, Gin?

435
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,312
Yes, Capt'...

436
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:37,314
But...

437
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,026
I never would've thought that this
would happen to our ship.

438
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,861
Don Krieg!

439
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,113
What now?

440
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,703
Let me lead the way, to the
Floating Restaurant Baratie.

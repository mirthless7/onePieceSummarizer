1
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:33,540
The Utopia operation starts!

2
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:33,540
The Rebellion is moving

3
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,710
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,850
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,180
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,740
Crocodile encourages with a civil war.

7
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,630
To stop this conspiracy,
Luffy and its crew entered the den of the enemy in Rainbase.

8
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,050
But they were made capture.

9
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,930
Crocodile revealed its final project.

10
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,980
Are the hopes of Vivi condemned to be buried by hot sands?

11
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,530
It is last midday.

12
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,420
The plan started.

13
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,160
Do not doubt him, Kohza.

14
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,290
You know the King me as well as.

15
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,220
Only the old men as continue to you to say that…

16
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,660
I did not come with you in Yuba by regard to the King.

17
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,530
They say that the rebellious army counts more than 100.000 men.

18
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,240
Ouais, I intended some to speak…

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,330
And there were deaths…

20
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,010
What?

21
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,830
When the rain falls, all these dreadful doubts will be unobtrusive.

22
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,700
It is true.

23
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,500
How this is possible?!

24
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,840
The channel of the village is dry!

25
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,930
Who could do that…?

26
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,790
We will not have any more water for the village!

27
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,290
It did not rain since more than one year…

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,910
Ca will be the end of Erumalu…

29
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,910
Do not doubt him, Kohza.

30
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,390
I do not want to doubt you but people die of hunger!

31
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,390
Even if you do not use it…

32
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,810
You must have some!

33
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,780
Not.

34
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,790
It is necessary to wait fallen from the true rain.

35
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,280
“Dance Powder” is a powder which brings misfortune.

36
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,160
Even more the minor amount will help!

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,060
So only it rained, the rebellion would cease!

38
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,310
That will give rise to only several disasters.

39
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,570
That cannot be repaired as easily as you believe it, Kohza.

40
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,080
I cannot any more…

41
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,280
TO SEE OTHER VILLAGES BEING DRAINED!!

42
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,910
You really did not change.

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,490
I changed.

44
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,960
I can fight.

45
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,690
I will return…

46
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,800
I will return…

47
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,020
AND I WILL TAKE MT RAIN TO YOU.

48
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,830
Where does this country go?

49
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,460
Where we go?

50
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,350
Where is the answer?

51
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,420
Something of terrible has just arrived, Kohza.

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,620
It did without something terrible, Chaka-Sama!

53
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,880
The King has…!

54
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,460
What!?

55
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,300
About what do speak you!?

56
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,730
He disappeared.

57
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,350
It is absurd.

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,780
Did you seek it!?

59
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,130
Yes.

60
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,530
Everywhere since the palate to the gardens and with the warehouses.

61
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,020
During the night is party?

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,640
It is not possible.

63
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,360
The guards supervised the room of the King.

64
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,400
He did not can pass without it being seen.

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,600
If it is thus…

66
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,330
If it is thus, then why the King hide does the morning of the departure of the battle!?

67
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,330
Find it!

68
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,240
Seek in all the city and beyond!

69
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,850
Yes.

70
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,430
To find somebody is the strong point of Pell.

71
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,740
But for the moment, it is in location with Rainbase.

72
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,700
If something were to arrive…

73
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,730
But I cannot act of my own boss…

74
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,690
Shit…!

75
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,120
That…

76
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,650
...com ptes you to make with Arabasta?

77
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,910
Should I tell you the type of anybody whom I mistake more?

78
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,060
It is those which risk their life for the happiness of the others.

79
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,430
Hypocrites.

80
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,430
You intend to kill my father?

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,290
You will never arrive there!

82
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,290
Do not look at me thus.

83
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,940
I do not have the intention of it.

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Of his death, I would not gain anything.

85
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,810
Cobra will know a humiliation much crueler than death.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,670
Crueler than death?

87
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,630
A princess should not have the air if scorning.

88
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,630
I ask it once again to you.

89
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,220
What the “Utopia Operation”?

90
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,540
Explain me!

91
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,140
He He. Summers you sure to seize your situation well?

92
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,850
Answer my question!

93
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,510
Which courageous Princess…

94
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,770
Well, the plan being already started…

95
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,920
I think that I can speak to you about it.

96
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,690
The plan which will put an end to the existence of this poor wretch country…

97
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,140
… the Utopia Operation.

98
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,860
I have bad news, Chaka-Sama!

99
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,100
The King has…!

100
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,210
What is there?

101
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,250
You found it.

102
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,520
Yes. It is in Nanohana.

103
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,510
Ca was confirmed.

104
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,470
I see. Thank you my God.

105
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,120
But…

106
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,220
But…

107
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,280
I am about to say something of incredible…

108
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,530
What you say?!

109
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:55,940
Kohza!

110
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,390
Kohza-San!

111
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,230
Wait!

112
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,960
We leave with you!

113
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,920
Why so suddenly?

114
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,240
You fell so low that!?

115
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,560
Do not doubt him, Kohza.

116
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,210
What is this they are, all these conneries!?

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,430
V-your Majesty…

118
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,150
What… do you have says…?

119
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,560
You have of course.

120
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,370
I must sincerely excuse myself.

121
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,130
I am that which stole the rain of this country.

122
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,530
King d' Arabasta, Cobra!

123
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,520
Cobra-Sama,

124
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,590
You joke?

125
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,560
In fact…

126
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,860
It is not a joke.

127
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,120
I used “Dance Powder” so that the rain falls exclusively on the town of Alubarna.

128
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Me, the beloved King!

129
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,240
I want to say, a King such as me should not miss anything.

130
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,940
C this is not possible…

131
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,520
But because of that, much of people died for lack of water and food.

132
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,280
Your Majesty, you knew…

133
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,520
Of course that I knew.

134
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,160
I also know that many oases were drained because of that.

135
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,540
But some sacrifices are necessary to protect the kingdom.

136
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,950
It is not possible…

137
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,500
You were with the current of this terrible situation and you do not have…

138
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,410
It is too egoistic! Your Majesty!

139
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,250
Will you give an opinion of me, the King?

140
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,410
Therefore I am here to excuse me.

141
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,380
I came until Nanohana.

142
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,080
What would you wish moreover?

143
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,990
My little brother died in Yuba…!

144
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,540
There is another reason with my arrival in this city.

145
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,130
As you know it, “Dance Powder” is prohibited by the world government.

146
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
If somebody warned himself to speak about it,

147
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,430
the general headquarter of the Navy would send its troops and would try to reverse the kingdom.

148
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,860
We must prevent that.

149
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,060
But you remember that two years ago,

150
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,840
great quantities of “Dance Powder” were the subject of smuggling in the country.

151
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,980
This incident must be forgotten at any price.

152
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,510
It is included/understood?

153
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,790
What wants to say…

154
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,610
Completely.

155
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,860
To erase forever any trace of this incident…

156
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,790
I must destroy this city like his inhabitants!

157
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,310
What!?

158
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,510
Ca goes too far!

159
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,540
Because of the orders of the King, we go…!!

160
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,700
He, Majesty!

161
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,130
Thus it was really of your fault!

162
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,170
Because of you…

163
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,370
Because of you…

164
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,230
Because you stole the rain, all the villages are dry, cursed would be you!

165
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,880
I will avenge my friends…!

166
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,320
Ca is enough! Stop that!

167
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,320
Majesty…!

168
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,540
My soldiers!

169
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,590
Reduce this city rotted in dust!

170
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,300
Kohza!

171
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,180
Kohza-San!

172
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Kohza.

173
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,160
I missed you.

174
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,990
What are you in the train of foutre?

175
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,990
Dumb…

176
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,970
What are you in the train of foutre?

177
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,970
Dumb…

178
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,370
Majesty…!

179
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,390
Not!

180
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,840
Isn't that seen?

181
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,760
I came to excuse me.

182
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,620
Stop your conneries!

183
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,470
Close it!

184
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,190
Do you know what you are saying!?

185
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,460
What a audacity!

186
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,210
That which used “Dance Powder” involving the dryness in this country…

187
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,720
I said to you to close it!

188
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,400
Why do you speak to me thus?

189
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,410
Kohza…

190
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,510
Remember that I am the King.

191
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,380
Majesty…

192
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,060
Close it! Close it! Close it!

193
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,290
It was nobody the other one than me…

194
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,850
Species of dumb!!!

195
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,140
People who died when the villages were dry…

196
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,550
Do you think of how they felt with their death!?

197
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,470
They were not hated or did not scorn themselves!

198
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,050
“It is not the fault of the King.”

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,850
“It is a marvellous person!”

200
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,400
Everyone believed in you until their death!

201
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,200
If you had not lied and had not said that you were innocent,

202
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,570
what would have become their feelings!?

203
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,010
Co… will bra…

204
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,990
Kohza-San!

205
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,790
Chief!

206
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,690
Kohza!

207
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,910
Well, we do not have any more time!

208
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:53,960
Kohza!

209
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,890
This country…

210
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,440
They all wanted to hear this answer…

211
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,360
This is why we fight.

212
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,030
At least…

213
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,200
… I made…

214
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,010
… what I could…

215
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,080
… to save it.

216
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,410
It is not possible…

217
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,070
They arrive.

218
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,350
A giant ship flies by here!!

219
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,920
Flee!

220
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,360
From where it leaves, this ship?!

221
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,050
Help me!!

222
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,040
Ca…

223
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,680
Ca cannot arrive!

224
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,440
All that for the final operation.

225
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,600
This mission is too easy.

226
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,750
Were there already difficult missions?

227
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,790
One succeeded!

228
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,630
Now, put fire and one draws from here!

229
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,130
Yes.

230
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,910
I do not feel at ease without this trick on my head!

231
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,590
Kohza!

232
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,760
Hold good, Kohza!

233
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,500
He!

234
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,430
The royal army left!

235
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:48,980
What?

236
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,960
How I was?

237
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,040
Was I quite royal!?

238
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,810
You were spectacular, Mr. 2, Bon Clay-Sama!

239
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,980
The fire should be extinguished!

240
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,510
The royal army put fire and east flees!

241
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,150
Quickly!

242
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,920
Extinguish this fire!

243
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,720
We must find Mr. 2 apart from the village.

244
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,620
We will finish in Alubarna.

245
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,640
Finally something of interesting.

246
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,890
Ambiguous!

247
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,090
It is the word which I prefer! Ambiguous!

248
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,000
Then, is the King of this country still King or not!?

249
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,890
Now, it is ambiguous!

250
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,710
The plan is a total success!

251
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,400
Where is Banchi!?

252
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,200
In the west of the city, Mr. 2, Good Clay-Sama!

253
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,860
What…

254
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,330
The King became a strange ballerina…

255
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,650
They is not good!
Ca does not die out!

256
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,560
Shit! Cursed either the King!

257
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,120
It was an impostor!

258
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,440
He misled us!

259
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,140
I must prevent everyone!

260
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,960
Which unpleasant boy.

261
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,890
Would you have seen something that you would not have had?

262
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,280
This moron showed himself.

263
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,460
Who are you?

264
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,450
To say to you to keep silent itself will probably not be used for large thing.

265
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,940
Water!
There is not enough water!

266
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,570
Wait, this water comes from my store!

267
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,720
You will have to pay!

268
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,790
Moron, at one similar moment!?

269
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,130
The city is in flames!

270
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,770
Extinguish fire!

271
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,230
Water!

272
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,440
Ca is not used for nothing.

273
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,070
We cannot contain fire.

274
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,420
We must flee.

275
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,990
Hold good, Kohza.

276
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,350
You are not those which die like that!

277
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,660
He!

278
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,160
Take Kohza!

279
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,720
Small, hold good.

280
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,540
They is dreadful…

281
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,540
To do that with a child…

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,570
My… My…

283
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,150
Your wounds?

284
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,580
We will look after them.

285
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,330
Do not speak any more.

286
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,610
But you are mistaken!

287
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,180
Everyone was made berner!

288
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,800
Hold good, small!

289
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:50,950
Kohza?

290
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,700
This country…

291
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,770
We will put an end to it.

292
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,190
Contact our other forces.

293
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,070
It is…

294
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,880
… the final fight.

295
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,450
It is well, but we do not have enough weapons!

296
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,370
Not, we have arm.

297
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,920
The ship which was crushed in the port…

298
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,350
It was a combat ship.

299
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,990
Really?

300
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,520
Yes, and it of it is full.

301
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,770
It is like a sign of the destiny…

302
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,740
Is this true?

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,430
Did a kid see me?

304
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,720
How it is damage!

305
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,750
Swan, Swan.

306
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,410
Frankly.

307
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,920
Now, it does not remain any more but with the pair of Mr. 4 to finish work…

308
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,050
The large one and the old hag can do it!

309
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,620
To kidnap the king was really not wizard!

310
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,610
Listen to, armed me rebel!

311
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,710
Arabasta that you know died!

312
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,660
It is our last battle!

313
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,120
We will crush Alubarna!

314
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,090
We all will put in this common attack!

315
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,960
No pity for the tyrant!

316
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,560
We will build a new kingdom!

317
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,590
Do not be ridiculous!

318
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,300
Cobra-Sama would never make a similar thing!

319
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,770
There must be an error!

320
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,430
But, Sir…

321
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,160
From the moment when the King disappeared and time to make the way, all coincides!

322
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,910
There cannot be of another explanation!

323
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,850
The news from what occurred to Nanohana is spread in any Arabasta!

324
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,160
And the rebellious armies of the other cities will be combined!

325
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,440
Moreover, people who still believed the king until now…

326
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,250
… came from there to hate it and take the weapons!

327
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,710
Their full number is unknown!

328
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,720
All the kingdom took the weapons and they will come here, in Alubarna!

329
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,400
They…

330
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,930
. .ne will not stop!

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,660
Which are your orders?

332
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,860
We will follow you.

333
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,770
How that could arrive…

334
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,570
Even the words of the King of yesterday become obscure…

335
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,630
What do I have to believe?

336
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,660
We will make our duty.

337
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,720
We are the royal guard of Arabasta!

338
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,310
We will not drop this country during the absence from the King!

339
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,700
Let us protect it in what we believe!

340
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,330
Let us protect this country!

341
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,120
We will fight against rebel!

342
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,240
Which démoniaque plan…

343
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
What do you think about it? You like my plan?

344
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,710
The plan to which you contributed is now moving.

345
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,100
If one listens attentively, I bet that one can hear the cries coming from Arabasta.

346
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,260
And only one thought:

347
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,730
“We will protect Arabasta…”

348
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,960
“We will protect Arabasta…”

349
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,640
“We will protect Arabasta…”

350
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,980
DECREE!

351
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,120
How can you be so inhuman!?

352
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,250
Doesn't that make you cry?

353
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,840
Love of the country…

354
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,970
… is what will destroy it.

355
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,470
This guy is an idiot.

356
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,770
Didn't he listen to what I said?

357
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,820
Of course, it is an idiot.

358
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,730
But…

359
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,730
This is why he is our Captain.

360
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,660
Crocodile…!

361
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,330
I will explode you the gueu…

362
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,490
I still remember all troubles that I had before arriving from there there.

363
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,130
My operations to incite the inhabitants to destroy their own villages…

364
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,550
To learn with my men how to make abuses all while being made pass for the royal army…

365
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,360
And do you know why I want of your kingdom very?

366
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,830
How could I include/understand what there is in your degenerated head!?

367
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,480
You are not really afraid of the words, Princesse.

368
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:22,830
Vivi!

369
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,340
He, He.

370
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,390
What do you make, Miss Wednesday?

371
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,390
I will stop them…

372
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,850
I will stop them…!

373
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,310
I can arrive still there in time!

374
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,240
Alubarna is in the East from here!

375
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,620
If I can go in Alubarna before the army rebels arrives there…

376
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,930
… then I will be able to stop them!

377
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,190
No matter what it costs some, I will make very to prevent your plan from succeeding!

378
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,280
Vivi.

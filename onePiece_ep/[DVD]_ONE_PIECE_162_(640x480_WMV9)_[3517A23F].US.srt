1
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,630
Impact!

2
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,860
Sanji!

3
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,590
The life is only suffering.

4
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,820
And now, more than two.

5
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,599
Very well, here it
that we will make.

6
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,059
In the middle of the boat.

7
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,910
I hang it on the mast. In the event of
danger, no matter who will be able to use it.

8
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,100
It is equitable like that.

9
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,939
B-good.

10
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,890
I prefer to keep it on me.

11
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,259
How?

12
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,060
You are the only sacrifice for
which I moved?

13
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:03,270
Chopper is in danger!
Former God VS Shura the Priest

14
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,589
What do you think about it?

15
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,989
Aren't they splendid?

16
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,140
Forgiveness?

17
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,650
The harvest of pumpkins
was good this year.

18
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,310
Yes…

19
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,320
I do not know how you to thank.

20
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,979
Please excuse me.

21
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,079
I caused you many troubles.

22
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,270
Your daughter helped this man with the hat
of straw and his/her companions to escape.

23
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,149
What makes you their accomplices.

24
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,820
Your life is thus in danger.

25
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,710
It was a service.

26
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,320
Here, we are with
the shelter of Mantra d' Eneru.

27
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,990
And on Angel Island?

28
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes?

29
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,989
Harvests. How
do they spend this year?

30
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,529
Ah, they occur rather well.

31
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,130
I see.

32
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,920
I am happy to hear it.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,470
Here pumpkin juice of my garden.

34
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,989
It is very tasty.

35
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,310
Yes, sorry. I will take some a little.

36
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,389
Conis-san.

37
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,240
Conis-san, come to taste.

38
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,420
Small, there is in bottom in the Blue Sea,
people who are made call “pirates”.

39
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,980
Did you know?

40
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,340
Not…

41
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,170
It is of the outlaws who
sail on blue water.

42
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,529
Although they all are different,

43
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,690
they are known to decorate their boat
of a black flag with tête de mort.

44
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,100
I think that Straw hat and
the others are themselves of the pirates.

45
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,270
But then! You want to say that
they was criminals since the beginning?!

46
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,340
And well, on the Blue Sea, it
are surely of the outlaws.

47
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,460
But the marginal ones are found
like them in each world.

48
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,480
In what their statute
is it different from yours?

49
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,900
Who can say that the acts of
aren't outlaws creditable?

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,650
To say the things in an extreme way…

51
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,659
a héro in time of war…

52
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,330
can be regarded as one
murderer in other times.

53
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,110
Myself, I sympathized
with pirates.

54
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,720
They came here there is more than twenty years,
when I was still God of this country.

55
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,430
I found them
enthralling and turbulent.

56
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,750
The good-byes were very painful.

57
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,390
Even if that is not seen with the first accesses, Skypiea is plunged in an interminable war.

58
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,990
Us, celestial People…

59
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,190
sums constantly in war against
Shandia, which we call the warriors.

60
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,390
Despite everything, Shandia
defy the authority of Eneru.

61
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,049
When you were God,

62
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,530
you wished a peaceful coexistence with Shandia to put a term at this century of war.

63
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,550
You had us to give again hope…

64
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,590
I had almost achieved my goal when
Eneru seized the divine throne.

65
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,969
Forgive me.

66
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,870
All these efforts for nothing.

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,119
Q-that
do you say?

68
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,010
You do not have to excuse you!

69
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,290
A legend is transmitted generation
in generation on Skypiea…

70
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,789
Very a long time ago…

71
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,089
The day when was born the Earth
Crowned of Upper Yard…

72
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,510
Mélodieux song of the island
resounds in all the country.

73
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,640
And at this moment, the war enters them
Shandia and the Celestial People was declared.

74
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,669
Like if this song in
had been the signal.

75
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,980
Thus, when this song resounds
again in our ears,

76
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,850
the war will have ended.

77
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,849
Song of the island?

78
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,240
Yes.

79
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,280
The Crowned Earth will sing again.

80
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,140
One day, undoubtedly.

81
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,430
That there
does it have?

82
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,699
Remain here, you two!
The duty calls me!

83
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,490
Ahead, Pierre!

84
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,819
Father!

85
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,940
This pumpkin juice is delicious!

86
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,800
Yes, it is sure.

87
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,980
Nothing better…

88
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,020
Time now came
to offer your life to Eneru God!

89
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,720
Fire!

90
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,309
Why did you dodge?

91
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,880
You do not have any chance to escape from it.

92
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,010
Fuza, ignites it!

93
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,710
THE BOAT!

94
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,150
You will grow.

95
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,149
Filth…

96
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,090
Shit!

97
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,060
He, Ho! Useless to worry about one
boat of which nobody any more will occupy himself!

98
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,229
You and your companions…

99
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,380
you are lost.

100
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,139
But, which are you at the end?!

101
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,049
Stop!

102
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,650
And one does not touch
only hair of the others!

103
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,729
Since you worry so much,

104
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,670
you would make better offer
your life well nicely!

105
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,380
NOT!

106
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,889
STOP!

107
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,910
STOP, PLEASE!

108
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,779
Pas le boat!

109
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,980
All except the boat!

110
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,240
Shit!

111
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,740
And shit…

112
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,550
Shit!

113
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,309
Stop immediately!

114
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,990
They entrusted the boat to me!

115
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,250
I am supposed to take care of it!

116
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,650
Now… What does one make, Fuza?

117
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,799
Raptor measuring nearly 9 meters
- Fuza

118
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,489
“Only one does not touch
hair of my companions. “

119
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,249
“Do not destroy the boat.”

120
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,900
“I do not want to die.”

121
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,129
Here is a difficult customer.

122
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:05,440
Priest of Skypiea
- Shura the Celestial Rider

123
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,439
A small so capricious shit.

124
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,510
Ca returns to me furious.

125
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,960
Gan Fall…

126
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,860
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

127
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,860
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

128
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,410
He!

129
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,679
Nami, hurries a little!

130
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,149
The farm!

131
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,589
Do not speak to me any more!

132
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,820
And if I fall?!

133
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,700
Is He, all well?

134
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,750
Ouais…

135
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,570
I suppose that yes…

136
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,899
A thing after the other…

137
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,679
Afflicted for all these troubles.

138
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,720
It is nothing.

139
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,579
That there
does it have?

140
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,120
You ace found God?

141
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,919
Not…

142
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,829
There is a puit.

143
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,070
A puit?

144
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,359
Your boat…

145
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,939
Your companions…

146
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,439
Your life…

147
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,820
You hold much with all that.

148
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,590
Why you are so weak
if you hold so much with the life?!

149
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,549
Stop!

150
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,510
This extreme lance!

151
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,889
Stop!

152
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,760
Ah, shit!

153
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,210
Species of dumb!

154
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,910
You hope to live…

155
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,140
without making sacrifices?

156
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,399
What does it have this guy?

157
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,650
It is like if… it
anticipated my gestures.

158
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,200
So that a sharp person,
another must die.

159
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,980
Thus the world functions.

160
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,840
You know that you are
on the Sacrificial Furnace bridge?

161
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,759
O-Oui.

162
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,399
Us a trick of the kind was told…

163
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,469
It was true.

164
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,840
Your companions who survived, try
to arrive up to now, in this moment even.

165
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:54,120
Marsh

166
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Numa

167
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Iron

168
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Tetsu

169
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Wire

170
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Himo

171
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Bubbles

172
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,950
Tama

173
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:54,120
Sacrificial furnace bridge

174
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,090
On this island, four zones, each one are controlled by one among us, the Priests.

175
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,540
The rules stipulate that once one
target enters one of these zones,

176
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,540
other Priests
cannot intervene.

177
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,290
But the Sacrificial Furnace bridge does not make
part of any of these zones.

178
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,119
What means that
it is a free zone.

179
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,420
I can thus act with my own way here.

180
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,619
However…

181
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,750
All this supposes that those which underwent
the Celestial Judgment already died.

182
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,720
Hein, then Luffy and the others are…

183
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,039
Do not make any you.

184
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,500
The fact that I would be there does not want
inevitably to say that your companions died.

185
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,800
Unfortunately…

186
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,530
I am here for other reasons.

187
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,139
Other reasons?

188
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,699
Oh!

189
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,270
But then, if Luffy and the others come to save us, that wants to say that we will be able to leave?

190
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,970
Yes, it is completely that.

191
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,100
If you arrive to you
to escape from the free zone.

192
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,809
However…

193
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,489
Good, wait.

194
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,340
The reason of my arrival is not
written in the rules of the Judgment.

195
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,040
When there are exceptions like
today, the rules are modified a little.

196
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,240
Exceptions?

197
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,499
Yes.

198
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,670
For example…

199
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,140
When three people leave the Sacrificial Furnace bridge with lianas to flee in the forest.

200
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh, this kind of situation.

201
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,419
Is God on this island, not true?

202
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,480
I am curious to meet it.

203
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,220
ALL IS DE SA FAULT!

204
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,419
But it is what its problem?

205
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,579
It leaves all alone in front of…

206
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,670
It is really egoistic.

207
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,689
You treat somebody of egoist?

208
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,200
I cannot blairer tone
behavior with the idiot.

209
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,620
It seems to me that you are
source of step badly of our troubles.

210
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,530
Really?

211
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,110
When somebody escapes, somebody
of other for expier his fault must die.

212
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,680
It is what is called a sacrifice and
it is the principle which directs this world.

213
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,340
But it would be still
better if they returned.

214
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,000
To see you dying would make them take
conscience of the weight of their fault!

215
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,190
Now, your life offers to God!

216
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,420
PAS QUESTION!

217
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Die!

218
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,520
All my excuses for waiting.

219
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,450
Knight of the Sky!

220
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,230

Let us do our better, Pierre!

225

226
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,480
Let us have fun a little, Fuza!

227
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,749
Impertinent!

228
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,950
This island does not need two Gods!

229
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,260
ALLEEEZ!!

230
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,799

237
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,600
Heap of shit! (I find that a little vulgar especially ken jap it says “onore” = you but in way impolite)

238
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,180

to await you while coming here…

239
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,650

Now, I will show you
power of my anger vis-a-vis the bloody nuisances.

Admirable! Admirable!

244
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,020
What you of a gift would say that
I especially reserved to you?

245
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,470
Chain Surprised Bubbles.

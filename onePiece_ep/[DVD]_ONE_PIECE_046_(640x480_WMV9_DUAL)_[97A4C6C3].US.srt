00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,399
Full speed ahead to the Grand Line!!!

00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,808
- lf you're scared, don't come up here.
Full speed ahead to the Grand Line!!!

8
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,601
lf you're scared, don't come up here.

9
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,771
S-S-Stupid, I'm not scared!

10
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,566
Sanji! FOOD! Food!

11
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,027
Alright, alright. Wait until I make it already!

12
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,283
Good morning, Nami-san!

13
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,826
Good morning, Sanji-kun.

14
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,455
Aw, c'mon Zoro, let's play tag.

15
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,414
Aw, c'mon Zoro, let's play tag.

16
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,457
Whaat!?

17
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,335
What? What? I wanna play! Let's do it! Let's do it!

18
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,671
Are you retarded? How old are you two?

19
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm gonna take my pre-breakfast nap.

20
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,635
He's afraid he's gonna lose.

21
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,556
What'd you say, bastard? That is not why!

22
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,350
Ha! Look how mad he's getting!

23
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,850
Whaat!?
Ha! Look how mad he's getting!

24
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,185
Whaat!?

25
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,728
Come back here, you son of a...

26
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,230
Oh, and name-calling now too, eh? Whoo! Naana!

27
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,522
Oh, and name-calling now too, eh? Whoo! Naana!

28
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,398
YOU!

29
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,278
From now on, you're my nakama!

30
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,114
Let's just get one thing straight.
This is ONLY cooperation.

31
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,616
Keep that In mind.

32
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,577
Zoro-san, over here!

33
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,036
Zoro! No fair, you have to play with me too!

34
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,080
Zoro! No fair, you have to play with me too!

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,413
Zoro! No fair, you have to play with me too!

36
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,915
I AM NOT PLAYING!

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,959
Nami-san, breakfast is served.

38
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,420
Hey, you losers! Time for grub!

39
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,797
AYE!!!

40
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,130
Get your ass back here! I'm not finished with you!

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,341
Get your ass back here! I'm not finished with you!

42
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,718
He said that to me, even back then.

43
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,720
What is it, Nami-san?

44
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,555
Oh, nothing.

45
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,557
Ah! I'm so hungry!

46
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,643
Food! Food-food!!

47
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,105
Looks so tasty!

48
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,234
By the way, what do you suppose
happened to Buggy?

49
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,652
Buggy?

50
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,154
Oh! That Buggy!

51
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,700
Who knows, maybe he's off
in the ocean somewhere.

52
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,369
It's hard to say.

53
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,331
When it comes to pirates, they're all different.

54
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,416
Is that so?

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,962
Bastard, what's your problem!? You started it!

56
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,966
I was a pirate hunter for a long time.

57
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,634
I know a lot about them.

58
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,346
Are you just going to stand there, Usopp?

59
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,723
Your food is disappearing.

60
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:25,974
Here's a special yogurt treat just for you.

61
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,284
- Luffy! You ate all of my food again!
Here's a special yogurt treat just for you.

62
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,102
- Luffy! You ate all of my food again!
Here's a special yogurt treat just for you.

63
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,828
Thank you, Sanji-kun!

64
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:30,353
GIVE IT BACK, JERK!!

65
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,188
GIVE IT BACK, JERK!!

66
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,573
ALRIGHT!!

67
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,451
At last, my Super Flashy Raft is complete!

68
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,830
You will all see. The most famous
pirate in the world...

69
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,249
Clown Pirate Buggy-sama...

70
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:57,172
is makin' a comeback. I'm makin' a flashy return!

71
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,383
I will do it no matter what!

72
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,054
I must have my revenge!

73
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,599
You flashy stinky rubber brat... just you wait!

74
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,478
You flashy stinky rubber brat... just you wait!

75
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,152
ONWARD!!

76
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:25,909
So what if I have bad luck in the beginning!?

77
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:26,284
So what if I have bad luck in the beginning!?

78
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:26,701
So what if I have bad luck in the beginning!?

79
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:26,951
So what if I have bad luck in the beginning!?

80
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,702
So what if I have bad luck in the beginning!?

81
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,455
I WILL NOT LOSE, DAMMIT!!

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,923
FOLLOWING THE STRAW HAT!
LITTLE BUGGY'S BIG ADVENTURE

83
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:40,048
FOLLOWING THE STRAW HAT!
LITTLE BUGGY'S BIG ADVENTURE

84
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,893
Somehow... I... I made it to the next island...

85
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,026
Dammit. Tryin' to scare me...

86
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,367
QUIT STARIN' YOU!

87
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,580
Punk, you lookin' down on me?

88
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,791
Looking down on someone like me...

89
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,127
You sure got some guts, pal.

90
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,838
I'm gonna eatcha!

91
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,217
I'm hungry as hell!

92
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,429
Since you dared to look down on my
great self, nothing can save you now!

93
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,765
You're gonna be mine in a flash! Just face it!

94
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,679
BARA BARA HOU!
(Cannon)

95
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,906
Don't bother trying to escape.

96
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,783
It's time to die.

97
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,419
I am SO SORRY! That was so rude of me!

98
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,086
I am SO SORRY! That was so rude of me!

99
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,296
I am SO SORRY! That was so rude of me!

100
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,219
PLEASE FORGIVE MEEE!

101
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,150
Over here, over here.

102
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,778
My plan is perfect.

103
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,369
Baka, baka, baka!

104
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,419
Ha-ha! Gotcha!

105
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,171
Gotcha- huh? Oh shit!

106
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,716
Why is this happening to me!?

107
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,219
Stop that, it hurts!

108
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:49,886
Already?

109
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,347
Is this how it all ends!?

110
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,431
Stop!

111
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,947
I'M NOT EVEN GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOUR STOMACH!?

112
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,075
HOW CAN THAT BE?!!

113
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,789
Hey, check it out! It's a hermit crab!

114
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,250
I wonder where it came from...

115
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,835
Maybe from Nami's village?

116
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,378
I guess...

117
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,755
Or maybe he's been hitching
a ride since Usopp's village.

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,966
If he has, it's been a long trip for him.

119
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,844
Maybe he wants to stay and sail together with us!

120
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,057
DAMMIT! WHY DO THESE THINGS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO MEEE!?

121
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,727
Hey, did you just say something?

122
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,854
Me? Nothing.

123
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,108
Weird... maybe it was my imagination...

124
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,068
Hey, Luffy! Quit slackin' off!

125
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,570
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

126
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,337
I... Where am I?

127
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,844
GET OUT.

128
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,431
Who's there?

129
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,768
I am the mighty guardian spirit of this island.

130
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,104
If you don't want to die, get out!

131
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,315
Guardian spirit?

132
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:28,443
And you're one of those, uhhh...

133
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,363
Freaky things!

134
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,865
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS, PUNK!
WATCH YOUR MOUTH!!

135
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,241
You know don't you?

136
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,744
If you take one step into this sacred forest,

137
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,789
you will be cursed, and the Gods
will kill you at that very minute.

138
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,083
Isn't that right?

139
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,876
HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW
YOU FLASHY IDIOT!!

140
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,878
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

141
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,425
What are these things?

142
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,678
They are the animals of the forest.

143
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,806
You better not touch them if you value your life!

144
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,227
Wow, these creatures are kinda interesting...

145
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,730
Hey! Didn't I tell you stay away from them!?

146
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:05,814
Hey! Didn't I tell you stay away from them!?

147
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,443
You shit! You dare to shoot me?

148
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,029
Crap. I missed.

149
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,823
Hold it right there!

150
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,575
What's this!?

151
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,203
Gotcha.

152
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,287
Come out!

153
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:21,538
Ow ow ow ow ow!
Come out!

154
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,123
Ow ow ow ow ow!

155
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,126
So, you have the power of the Devil Fruit!

156
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,044
And what're you gonna do about it?

157
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,838
People like you... er...

158
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,214
People like you...

159
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,174
You are...?

160
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,557
Are you a son in a box?

161
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,310
Yeah, My mother was too overprotective
of me, and now look what...

162
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,603
OH SHUT UP!

163
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,439
That joke is SO OLD!

164
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,150
Bastard, you'd better not move.

165
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,696
Anyone who dares to hurt these animals, will die!

166
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,991
Oh? So you wanna go at it with me?

167
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,368
I admire your courage.

168
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,287
But it won't be my fault when you die.

169
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,257
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

170
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:21,348
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,543
Gotcha!

172
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,005
Hold it right there! Idiot!

173
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,966
Hey! That's cheating!

174
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,928
Oh really? What about THIS?

175
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,972
What is it you would say? Bring it on!!

176
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,880
BARA BARA KINKYUU DASSHUTSU!
(Emergency Escape!)

177
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,827
OWW!

178
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,469
Stop right there.

179
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,054
Don't move!

180
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,432
It's a pity,

181
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,477
but I cannot forgive anyone...

182
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,814
They are this island's treasure.

183
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,569
Those animals are treasure?

184
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,112
What do you mean ''treasure''?

185
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,531
Treasure is money, gold, jewels, and stuff like that!

186
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,699
You flashy moron.

187
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,160
Cut the crap.

188
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:09,456
These animals are the reason you came here!

189
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,583
Why would someone like me care about them!?

190
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,668
I'm not here for sight-seeing!

191
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,797
You're not a poacher?

192
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,466
Of course not!

193
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,343
Until death, I will always be...

194
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,219
The Great Clown Pirate Buggy-sama!

195
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,305
Why would I care about some silly animals?

196
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,598
PIRATE?

197
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,725
You say you're a pirate?

198
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,394
Me too!

199
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,938
I was a pirate too a long time ago!

200
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,649
I'm so so so sorry!

201
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,194
So you're a pirate too, eh?

202
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,128
So whatcha think of my special brew?

203
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,422
It's the best!

204
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,966
It's been so long since I last had a good drink!

205
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,720
Well, drink as much as you like!

206
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,307
And hey, I'm really sorry about
what happened earlier.

207
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,478
I thought you were a poacher, see,

208
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,772
here to hunt the animals.

209
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,400
Oh, come on, you're apologizing too much.

210
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,193
It's in the past!

211
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,196
And besides, you're treating me to this great sake!

212
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,786
That's all I care about...

213
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,663
Treasure and sake!

214
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,166
I really admire that!

215
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,961
Man, you are one awesome pirate.

216
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,296
A good guy...

217
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,384
By the way... how did you
come to be on this island?

218
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,013
Ah, I just came here looking for the treasure.

219
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,347
What? No way!

220
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,640
There's TREASURE on this island?

221
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,057
Hold your horses.
There's TREASURE on this island?

222
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,267
Hold your horses.

223
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,978
If I'd found that treasure, I wouldn't be here now.

224
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,355
Ah... Oh yeah, I guess you're right.

225
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,817
Anyway, a lot of things happened.

226
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:06,322
I was left behind by the others, and I've
been here for about 20 years now.

227
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,824
20 years!?

228
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,036
That must've been really hard on you, huh?

229
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,539
Well, I don't know if I'd say that.

230
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,000
I still have these guys here, after all.

231
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,087
I'm used to it, I've become pretty happy here.

232
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,299
No kidding?

233
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:28,636
You find this more fun than being a pirate?

234
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,639
Well, being a pirate was fun.

235
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,183
It was good.

236
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:39,481
I still feel that treasure's worth risking your life for.

237
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,984
Damn straight!

238
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,404
Hey, you know, when I collect my crew again,

239
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,948
you wanna be one of my nakama?

240
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:53,328
We could use a great guy like you.

241
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,955
You've got the soul of a true pirate.

242
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,624
So, how about it?

243
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,753
You really mean it? You would want me?

244
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,424
I'm so glad you said that.

245
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,552
But, these animals are my nakama.

246
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,974
We've been together for 20 years.

247
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,936
Even animals have feelings.

248
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,940
I can't just pick up and leave them.

249
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,572
What? What's so funny?

250
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,369
You know, you just reminded me of someone else...

251
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,830
who asked me if I wanted to be a pirate.

252
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,083
He was a funny young pirate.

253
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,422
Hey, dont worry about it, ossan.

254
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,632
You're lucky we came here, even if it took 20 years.

255
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,072
You're lucky we came here, even if it took 20 years.

256
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,428
What if it had been 30? You might be dead by now!

257
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,895
Straw Hat!

258
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,393
He was a good kid, with a big heart.

259
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,980
I bet if you met him, you'd like him too.

260
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,151
A young pirate guy like that was here, huh?

261
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,821
I've met some really awful kids in my day.

262
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:11,531
Assemble!

263
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,324
BARA BARA PARTS!

264
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,495
Are you talking about these?

265
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,414
Ack! My parts!

266
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,375
That's a real thief for you!

267
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,359
WAIT!

268
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,087
You're goin' flyin', Buggy!

269
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:30,001
GOMU GOMU NO...

270
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,595
BAZOOKA!!

271
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,433
And that's how I started my journey.

272
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,604
Just thinking about it makes
me fill with hate and rage.

273
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,855
Really?

274
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,857
That must have been hard on you.

275
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,235
Well, there's lots of different
kinds of kids in this world.

276
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,572
Anyway, tonight, let's celebrate.

277
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,909
A nice evening like this shouldn't
be wasted on bad feelings.

278
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,410
You're right.

279
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,705
To pirates!

280
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:00,955
And to our meeting!

281
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,707
And to our meeting!

282
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,626
KANPAI!

283
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,970
Hey, I'm really sorry.

284
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,640
Thanks for rebuilding my raft.

285
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,142
What? It was nothing.

286
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,063
So, you're really going to stay here?

287
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:28,692
Yeah. Together with my nakama.

288
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,028
I see.

289
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,406
Well, take care!

290
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,615
You too!

291
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,214
Goodbye, my friend!

292
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,757
Take care of yourself!

293
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,678
Yeah...

294
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,305
YOU TOO!!

295
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,852
FULL SAIL!

296
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:12,309
Buggy...

297
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:17,282
There are many strange sea creatures in this area...

298
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,660
Try to be careful.

299
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,251
THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT TO SAY TO HIM!

300
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,055
RUN, BUGGY!!

301
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,933
Watch out!

302
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,519
Run! Watch out!

303
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:51,983
What's that?

304
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,992
SHIIIT!!!

305
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,181
Hot damn...

306
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,642
Who is that?

307
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,728
Well, if it isn't a beautiful lady.

308
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,816
Well, looks like he's saved.

309
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,027
I was afraid for him.

310
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:44,327
Whatever you do, take care!!

311
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,416
Man, I really owe you.

312
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:52,502
I thought I was a flashy goner there!

313
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,337
It's no big deal.

314
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,340
You're Clown Pirate Buggy, aren't you?

315
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,259
How do you know that?

316
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,761
Just who are you?

317
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,389
I'm looking for a certain person.

318
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,017
You know this man, don't you?

319
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,227
YAA! Shitty rubber kid!

320
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,231
You jerk! You watch out' I'll kick
your ass one of these days!

321
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,899
Just you wait...!

322
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,278
This is the man you're looking for?

323
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,325
Come on. I'll make us something to eat.

324
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,624
I see now.

325
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,711
So that's why you saved me.

326
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,046
Exactly.

327
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,756
So, what do you think?

328
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,841
Shall we cooperate?

329
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,554
I think so.

330
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,916
If we both work towards the same goal,

331
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,808
we can get results faster.

332
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,101
Wonderful.

333
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:51,644
Then, kanpai.

334
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:54,898
Kanpai.

335
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,201
Sanji... gimme food...

336
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,455
You just ate...

337
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,832
have some... self-control.

338
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,293
You guys, shut the hell up.

339
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,629
How am I supposed to get any rest...?

340
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,215
You freakin' sleep all the time.

341
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,551
Help out a little, will ya?

342
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,347
Arguing with each other in their sleep...

343
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,973
They're such weird guys.

344
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,727
Well, I guess I should go to sleep too.

345
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,774
Good night.

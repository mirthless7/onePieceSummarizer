1
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,640
Vice-admiral! He is not there!

2
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,530
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE!

3
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,960
Where is party?

4
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,880
Its bicycle is not there any more, it probably left at sea.

5
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,120
You dispatch, call the Council of the 5 Seniors!

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,850
Yes, Chief!

7
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Oops, sorry.

8
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,330
Still this man?

9
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
Probably in tourist visit, as usual.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,610
Does it realize well of its responsibilities?

11
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,870
It poses problem to us when it walks like that.

12
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,290
The most powerful man of the Navy

13
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,920
The Admiral Ao Kiji.

14
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,330
What?

15
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,870
This crew is only one band of nazes.

16
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,270
The man of pride! Foxy the Silver fox!

17
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,639
He, Captain!

18
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,110
Stop playing and come to help us!

19
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,499
The waves are gigantic!

20
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,870
Giiigantesque!

21
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,539
And that amuses it.

22
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,100
Lastly, he will laugh less when the boat capsizes.

23
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,760
It would be necessary initially that the mast holds out.

24
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,100
Really?! What will it arrive to us then?

25
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,680
Do not worry you.

26
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,290
The boat will not run even if the mast is broken.

27
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,950
And we have a qualified and nice navigatrice on board.

28
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,549
Iya! The mast will release!

29
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,670
Really? What it will arrive to us?!

30
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,890
Do not worry you!

31
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,470
The boat will not run even if the mast is broken.

32
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,809
He! The guy!

33
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,409
Ca made a bucket!

34
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,410
Oyabin! It is Straw hat!

35
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,720
Oi, Straw hat!

36
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,160
Do not occupy you of us!

37
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,880
I am not in so bad posture to need your assistance!

38
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,179
Bye!

39
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,860
Oi! If you want to help me… No problems!

40
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,860
Oyabin, behind you!

41
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,989
It is nothing!

42
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,700
NORO NORO BEAM!

43
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,310
Oh not!

44
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,169
He, that feels bad for them!

45
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,929
A small boat as this one will not hold out.

46
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,550
You move all!

47
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,730
Catch that!

48
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,969
Morons, not that! The cord!

49
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,390
I hold you Luffy!

50
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,660
I am so ashamed.

51
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,369
I lost my 500 team members.

52
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,280
And now I lose my ship.

53
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,610
It would seem that he finished himself for me, Foxy the Silver fox.

54
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,840
It would have perhaps been preferable that I sink with my boat?

55
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,640
Oyabin!

56
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,239
What do you say?

57
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,990
It is not my role to say that, but it is a lie.

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,320
Please, take pity of me and lets me remain on your boat!

59
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,760
Ok. You do not have the choice as long as you do not have a boat.

60
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,949
Here a little soup.

61
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,449
Ca will heat you.

62
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,969
Ah, that with the good air.

63
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,200
I will eat with Choppie.

64
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,749
Sanji, lets me have some a little!

65
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,770
It does not remain about it any more. Wait until tomorrow.

66
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,510
What is there? Would not be timid.

67
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,639
It is what that?

68
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,630
There is nothing to eat in it!

69
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,979
Would not be so impertinent! I you will make it puff out!

70
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,229
He, is calmed…

71
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,599
The calm one, Sanji!

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,819
, Excuses you too!

73
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,710
Hein?

74
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,710
Iya, they is marvellous!

75
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,760
As much gold.

76
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,630
They are so rich?

77
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,310
Oh not, soup will cool.

78
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,640
Choppy! You are there, is not this step?!

79
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,080
Choppy!

80
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,580
Hein?

81
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,650
Oh, it was right a candle.

82
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,950
Heu? Where is Oyabin?

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,830
Choppy!

84
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,759
As if I were to fish.

85
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,450
I am the guest!

86
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,020
There is enough food here.

87
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,530
He is really stupid.

88
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,630
It is…

89
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,619
Oyabin! It is S.S. Sexy Foxy!

90
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,630
What?

91
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,940
Do Oh, then you leave us?

92
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,530
They from go away?

93
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,910
Banzai! Banzai!

94
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,080
Password…

95
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,300
Sodium.

96
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,220
Where are they?

97
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,410
They are already assembled on board their boat.

98
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,900
My companions… You did not can forget Oyabin in spite of our separation?

99
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,869
Really?

100
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,890
All is arranged so that you can join Foxy Pirates.

101
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,630
What is what does not go the guy?

102
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,620
Let us have fun the festival.

103
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,380
It is impossible, Foxy-san.

104
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,490
What?

105
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,240
Who are you?

106
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,900
[Fang-frog = Frog-Poisonous]

107
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,150
And they are under my orders!

108
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,310
Fang-Frog?

109
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,480
Who are they?

110
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,000
One would say the pirates who were made beat in Davy Back Fight before us.

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,239
Were they made capture by them, this time?

112
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,579
Stupid Head of puzzle.

113
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,170
They are feeling reluctant them pirate which gained, after all.

114
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,250
If you hope to settle on this ship, I will not remain.

115
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,299
Allons-y. We do not have anything to make here.

116
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,590
Wait!

117
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,360
I did not finish any with you!

118
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,820
My new crew still did not withdraw his mask.

119
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,390
It is a horror. They seem to rely always on their former captain.

120
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,930
It is because they do not love the new captain.

121
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,680
Oyabin is really cool.

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,589
But it is always a head of puzzle.

123
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:07,310
The weak ones follow most extremely, that they respect it or not.

124
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,020
If they see you being made beat, they will change opinion.

125
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,570
Face me, Foxy the Silver fox!

126
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,000
Poor clown…

127
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,610
Do you think of being able to beat me?

128
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,659
It would seem that he wants to fight.

129
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,360
He, Tête of puzzle is in anger!

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,130
You dispatch, go up to see!

131
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,910
Head of puzzle?

132
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,230
In anger?

133
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,790
Oyabin…

134
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,469
What are there, Porche and Hamburger?

135
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,200
Be more enthusiastic!

136
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,580
We will recover our boat and our crew.

137
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,350
We, Foxy Pirates, ask Davy Back Fight against you, Fang-Frog Pirates!

138
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,180
I will show you who am the captain here!

139
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,500
You praised capacity to beat me?

140
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,060
If you want a combat with against one, start with a match captain against captain!

141
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,510
No the objection?!

142
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,790
Oyabin takes all its time.

143
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,590
It is because it has a capacity.

144
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,129
Will it make use of it?

145
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,909
What do you want that it uses of other?

146
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,959
It left!

147
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,220
NORO NORO BEAM!

148
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,910
The guy, catch it!

149
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,870
It is easy to avoid the rays by reflecting them!

150
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,859
I know your weak point!

151
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,970
Oyabin!

152
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,749
What do you make?

153
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,400
Stop immediately!

154
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,240
Throw your weapon!

155
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,840
Shit!

156
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,930
You saw the stupidity of your former captain?!

157
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,550
You should not count on somebody like him! Included/understood?!

158
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,060
He, you!

159
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,979
This was not a combat with against one?!

160
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,530
It is rotted!

161
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,499
You it intruding, the farm!

162
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,730
I never said that I accepted Davy Back Fight.

163
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,639
Which bastard…

164
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,790
Stop.

165
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,370
It is their combat.

166
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,660
Do not interfere yourself that.

167
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,930
It is true.

168
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,800
Keep silent yourself and looks at, Straw hat.

169
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,720
I will show you how proud Silver plated Renard, Foxy, bldg.

170
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,540
Ah! It is what that!?

171
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,990
This dirty Fox left.

172
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,359
Where it passed?!

173
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,309
Ah, by there! It is true, I saw it leaving by there!

174
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,870
Yosh, by there, OK?!

175
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,230
Berner will not be left!

176
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,370
Are they making a banquet or what up there?

177
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,409
I should go perhaps there too.

178
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,430
What? You would prefer that she pursues you rather than to remain here with me?

179
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,850
Look at, it is your turn.

180
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,640
And a roasted fox, one!!

181
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,040
Oyabin!

182
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,630
Return there!

183
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,160
I am your boss!

184
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,000
Aren't He, the weapons prohibited?

185
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,640
Why do you strike your own soldiers?

186
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:40,480
If you use violence to make you respect, you are nothing more than one gangster.

187
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,820
You are not a sizeable captain.

188
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,000
Give up…

189
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,650
This ship…

190
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,040
And this crew!

191
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,910
I will not give myself anything of all that!

192
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,220
Your mouth!

193
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,950
Oyabin!

194
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,740
He, Head of puzzle!

195
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,660
Cling!

196
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,550
It is you, Straw hat?

197
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,920
I authorize you to see me in such a state.

198
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,600
He.

199
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,200
Do I can make you a last request?

200
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,730
Take this.

201
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:47,430
It was the greatest battle of my life.

202
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,710
He, it is…

203
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,760
You were brilliant until now…

204
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,390
I am your adversary!

205
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,559
I await you!

206
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,190
Fang-Frog Pirates!

207
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,810
It is a cut afro!

208
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,029
He, you have nothing to do with that.

209
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,659
Of course that if!

210
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,619
I do not want to fight against a guy who is worth 100 million.

211
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,830
What is what I gain there by striking you?

212
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,710
What is what you say?

213
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,740
If you low the crew of Straw hat, you will empocheras for 160 million rewards it!

214
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,869
But it is not all…

215
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,820
They have a large gold heap on their boat!

216
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,280
Ca does much money!

217
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,150
Surprised?! Fight, salts robber!

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,559
Frankly, when they have…

219
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,080
Since when is it so trustful?

220
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,850
I wonder whether the heap narrowed… I will throw a glance after…

221
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,850
A gold heap…

222
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,090
Really?!

223
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,680

224
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,100

227
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,390
He!

228
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,020
Give us nice gold…

229
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,650
They will not be calmed as much as they will not have taken a beating.

230
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,740
Ok, I go there.

231
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,350
We are 500!

232
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,020

237
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,040
How is what you believe?! That I do not have the force of my brother?!

238
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,330
There is nobody here except me which can beat it!

239
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,339
Go ahead gently on your force.

240
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,870
Remember that your adversaries are the human normal ones.

241
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,990

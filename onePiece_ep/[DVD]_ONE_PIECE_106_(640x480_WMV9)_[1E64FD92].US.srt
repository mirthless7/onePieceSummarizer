1
00:02:52,010 --> 00:03:01,070
The trap of the absolute end!

2
00:02:52,010 --> 00:03:01,070
Rush in Rain Dinners

3
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,370
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,180
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,490
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,470
Luffy and its crew arrived at the base of the operations of Crocodile, Rainbase.

7
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,710
However, by an extraordinary blow dealt by fate,

8
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,330
a battalion of the Navy, under the orders of Colonel Smoker, waited there.

9
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,970
After having started the combat against the Marines and the Million Works Baroque,

10
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,750
Luffy and its crew sink in the casino of Crocodile, Rain Dinners.

11
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,890
It is inside, hein?

12
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,870
CROCODILE!

13
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,030
Wait, dumbs!

14
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,540
You will not leave yourselves there!

15
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,130
Bandage large mouths…

16
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,020
One will have finally peace.

17
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,690
CROCODILE!

18
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,460
BRING BACK YOUR BOTTOM!

19
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,590
I WILL DISPATCH You UNTIL ALUBARNA!

20
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,990
I GO TE…

21
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,550
You believe that will make it leave?!

22
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,050
This type is the hero of this country!

23
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,240
You will put the customers to us at back!

24
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,160
understood.

25
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,470
Good, one does what then?

26
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,820
At-await one minute.

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,710
Without Vivi, one cannot recognize Crocodile!

28
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,720
And besides, where did it pass?

29
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,730
VIVI!

30
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,180
CROCODILE!

31
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,350
OR SUMMERS YOU?

32
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,660
Mr. the Director-Assistant, of the equivocal people entered our establishment…

33
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,620
Said to safety to deal with them.

34
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,370
One should not let them cause the least nuisance.

35
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,270
They are not shown.

36
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,920
Neither Vivi, nor Crocodile.

37
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,740
I caught up with you…

38
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,980
Straw hat!

39
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,200
Smoker!

40
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,750
You made me run up to now…

41
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,800
The enfumor!!

42
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,750
Fi- Seams!

43
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,290
And shit! How the enfumor did track us until Rainbase?

44
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,250
Is enough that Luffy passes by there so that all becomes out of control.

45
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,340
The casino is surrounded by a lake.
You cannot you flee nowhere!

46
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,700
Excuse us, Mister!

47
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,340
Dear Sir, the governmental officers are not authorized inside.

48
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,500
Please leave the casino immédia…

49
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,200
It is obstinate!

50
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,850
Wait!

51
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,650
It is the only type which I cannot fight.

52
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,150
One moment, Mister.

53
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,020
Would like you to have the kindness of fate…

54
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,480
I did not knock something?

55
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,320
Mrs. the Director, it is a true disaster.

56
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,450
Mysterious individuals ransack the casino.

57
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,740
Bring them to District VIP.

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,880
On order of the owner, Crocodile.

59
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,800
Wait!

60
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,360
He, look in front!

61
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,610
Welcome!

62
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,660
By here, please.

63
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,350
Please move by here.

64
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,430
Welcome with District VIP.

65
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,330
District VIP?

66
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,050
Does he say to us to enter here?

67
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,350
Hein? Here is somebody who speaks my language!

68
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,810
Go, one goes there!

69
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,740
VIP? But is good blood, which their relation with Crocodile?

70
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,160
Once this finished little game, I will see them, him and the pirates of straw hat on the scaffold!

71
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,660
But… It is what a VIP?

72
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,850
Hey, the corridor separates into two!

73
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,510
Ca says VIP… go on the left!

74
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,090
Ca says pirate other side!

75
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,220
Which direction one takes??

76
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,450
Hurry to choose!

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,510
One takes VIP, of course! VIP!

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,700
But, one is pirates!

79
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,800
And the pirates… go by here!

80
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,710
Ouais, you ace reason there.

81
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,600
At wait!

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,870
Straw hat!

83
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,880
It is what this brothel?

84
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,920
How can one be enough stupid to fall into a similar trick!?

85
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,580
One falls into darkness! Swim!!

86
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,800
It IS a TROUUUUU!!

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,220
I wonder where they left…

88
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,930
Colonel Smoker?

89
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,680
I wonder where Colonel Smoker passed…

90
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
It is probably with the continuation of straw hat.

91
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,980
The CEC woman… She is Navy…

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,990
O- oh not… My glasses…

93
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,290
My glasses… My glasses…

94
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,610
What do I have to make?

95
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,020
Without my glasses, I…

96
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,390
You are well? You…

97
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,220
You…

98
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,280
You disappeared?

99
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,060
Hold good!

100
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,910
Tashigi sergeant!

101
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,470
You are there!

102
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,680
I am very well.

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,910
Ah! Heu…

104
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,470
They are with you…

105
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,550
Ah! You found them to me!

106
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,450
It is very nice with you.

107
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,810
Thank you infinitely.
Goodbye!

108
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,840
By here!

109
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,480
Well!

110
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,440
It is stamped…

111
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,960
She said that I was nice!

112
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,140
But to compliment me, that does not return to me happy!

113
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,170
It is serious content.
Species of idiot!

114
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,920
A very clever trap!

115
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,110
Yes, there was no means of avoiding it.

116
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,250
One could easily avoid it!

117
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,010
It is exactly what he wanted that one makes!

118
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,910
How you can be also stunned, both?

119
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,410
Most important it is that…

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,640
I have the impression that my force is aspired…

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,520
A problem?
You do aces hunger or you want something?

122
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:43,850
Luffy!

123
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,290
Luffy!

124
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,470
In dumb!!

125
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,320
If you seek the brawl,
bring back yourself… the enfumor!

126
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,860
I helped it to beat Man-Bends as… a man…

127
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
What…

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,010
I feel my force which from goes away…

129
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,820
It is as if I were in the ocean…

130
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,430
What did you make in Luffy?

131
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,270
The end of my jutte is made of an ore called Kairouseki.

132
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,270
Kairouseki:Agalmatolite (kind of jade) marine.

133
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,850
It is a mysterious ore which one finds only in certain areas of the sea.

134
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
The ore itself still contains some secrecies,

135
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,800
but we know that it emits the same kind of energy as the sea.

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,730
See it like a kind of solidified sea.

137
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,420
Then it is that which drains the force of Luffy.

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,490
All the prisons of the HQ of the Navy are made with this stone.

139
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,030
It prevents the criminals having eaten fruits of the demon to escape.

140
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,360
Then the bars of this cage must be made with also…

141
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,500
If such were not the case, I would have already left.

142
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,190
But not before to have crushed all to you until you can flee never again.

143
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,780
Wait, wait!

144
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,170
How can you think of beating you in one similar moment?

145
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,890
Moreover, it is a man-smoke, your sabers will not be able to cut it!

146
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,760
It rightly.

147
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,300
Give up.

148
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,210
You all will die the ones with the others.

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,870
Then try to hear you.

150
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,310
Crocodile!

151
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,890
What?

152
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,090
Then it is one of Shichibukai…

153
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,430
Our so much awaited host shows himself finally.

154
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh oh, then the rumors saying that you were an insane dog are true, Smoker-Kun.

155
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,360
You never took to me for an ally.

156
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,220
Although, obviously, you were right.

157
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,020
Smoker, I will make you die in an unhappy accident.

158
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,280
I will inform the government that you fought valiantly against the pirates of straw hat.

159
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,910
I am unaware of why you came in this country, but…

160
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,170
it obvious that you is acted of your own boss.

161
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,440
Never the government would have sent to you here.

162
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,660
They make confidence in Shichibukai, see you.

163
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,370
Then it is you, Crocodile?

164
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,400
Hey! You! Fight against me!

165
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,180
You cannot return yourself in the head not to touch the cage??

166
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,660
Luffy with the straw hat.

167
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,170
I congratulate you to be arrived up to now.

168
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,790
I will suitably kill you in some time, then would be patient.

169
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,280
Our guest of honor did not arrive yet.

170
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,260
Guest of honor?

171
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,790
My partner went to seek it.

172
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,210
I cannot allow myself to be retained here longer.

173
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,130
I must…

174
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,330
You are rather violent kind, Princesse.

175
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,340
One did not expect from it less than one Frontier Agent.

176
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,120
But, you do not think that lasted enough and that you should come with us?

177
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,940
I must quickly join the others…

178
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,780
Ahead.

179
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,290
The Boss awaits us.

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
Do not touch me!

181
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,470
Qu… What?
A bird?

182
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,970
A falcon!

183
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,890
What makes a sparrow with a machine-gun?

184
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,670
It is enormous!

185
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,280
Cut down it!!

186
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,080
Shit! The Princess!

187
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,530
Pell!

188
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,790
You came to save me!

189
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,150
That made well a long time, Vivi-Sama.

190
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,880
How is my Father?

191
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,070
He is well.

192
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,840
Its Majesty and me let us have both read your letter, Vivi-Sama.

193
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,720
Then… Did Karu arrive healthy and except at Alubarna?

194
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,300
Yes. It is a very brave mallard.

195
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,650
God thank you!

196
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,240
We know our enemy, now.

197
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,910
Thanks to you and Igaram-San,

198
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,450
all became perfectly clearly.

199
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,070
Vivi-Sama, wait here a moment, I request from you.

200
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,160
Pell? Is it…
Pell the Falcon?

201
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,250
… The warrior most extremely of Arabasta?

202
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,300
Fruit Tori Tori.
Model Falcon.

203
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,300
Tori = Bird

204
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,090
It is one of the 5 fruits making it possible to fly.

205
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,410
Appreciate what you will see with his right value!

206
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,670
You Kill it! Cut down it!

207
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,400
It disappeared!

208
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,310
Tobizume = Air Greenhouse

209
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,510
We are saved!

210
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,640
Now, I must quickly join the others…

211
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,510
Well.

212
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,300
All that facilitates the things to me.

213
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,810
Which splendid spectacle.

214
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,850
Miss All Sunday!

215
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,640
Now, they are not to me any more any utility.

216
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,600
My invaluable employees.

217
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,770
Mrs.… Vice-president…

218
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,320
Who are you?

219
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,650
Which extraordinary spectacle.

220
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,220
I had never seen any human able to fly.

221
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,040
But I wonder whether you are stronger than me.

222
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,870
Is Vivi-Sama, it one of the people who threaten our country?

223
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,440
If that does not get out of order, I would wish to invite the Princess in our establishment.

224
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,700
Does that pose a problem?

225
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,250
Do not formulate a request also absurd.

226
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,500
It is out of the question.

227
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,740
Ah yes?

228
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,290
STOP TO YOU FOUTRE OF US!

229
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,720
A Princess should not employ such a coarse language, Miss Wednesday.

230
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,790
Salt witch! You killed Igaram…

231
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,840
Igaram? Ah, Mr. 8.

232
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,570
Then, it is you who killed Igaram-San?

233
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,890
Why are you both if opposed?

234
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,530
Do you think that it is different from what you made with my employees?

235
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,750
Which ridiculous point of view.

236
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,490
BITCH!!

237
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,080
I will transform you into sand for Arabasta!

238
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,900
Pell…

239
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,620
Vivi-Sama! Summers you wounded?

240
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,800
One that I had impaled it, isn't this would have said?

241
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,400
What did you make him?

242
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,420
Pas la pains to arrive from there there.

243
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,100
I nothing but do have fun a little bit.

244
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,560
Then you also, you have a capacity of a fruit of the demon.

245
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,820
Exact. I ate the Fruit Hana Hana.

246
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,820
Hana = Fleur

247
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,080
I can make flower any part of my body like a flower.

248
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,110
It is my capacity.

249
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,220
And since I am able to make push my body on any surface, you cannot escape to me.

250
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,100
To escape to me?

251
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,770
Would not be ridiculous!

252
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,780
I will avenge Igaram-San at once!

253
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,310
I am sorry.

254
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,090
I would adore to still divert you, but I miss really time.

255
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,620
THEN DO NOT MAKE any You!
YOU DO NOT NEED any MORE!

256
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,920
You do not want to understand.

257
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,880
Tender…

258
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,630
Power.

259
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Speed.

260
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,520
Vis-a-vis me…

261
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,800
They are not used for nothing.

262
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,590
PELL!!

263
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,640
Was this love the most powerful warrior of the kingdom?

264
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,860
Impossible Im-…

265
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,560
Well. Can we go there?

266
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,630
I cannot believe it…

267
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,200
The Boss and your friends await you

268
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,080
in a cage with Rain Dinners.

269
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,660
Imitation of Sanji.

270
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,320
“Which puffed out all the meat, brothel?”

271
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,180
You do not want to be a little more…

272
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,790
I was how?

273
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,960
Look at that!

274
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,910
“Oni…”

275
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,060
SERIOUS?!

276
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,680
How you can make the idiots in a desperate plight like that??

277
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,890
But one cannot leave!
I am bored me!

278
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,520
It is desperate because one cannot leave!

279
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,570
If that is, one will be made kill!

280
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,930
And you, why you roupilles?

281
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,500
Oh, already the morning?

282
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,200
It is the semi-day!

283
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,840
You, isn't this is an authoritative young woman?

284
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,530
And then? Benefit well from your small strolls as much as you can!

285
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,030
Once this type will have left this cage,
it will send to you valser until in the clouds!

286
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,160
Isn't this, Luffy?

287
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,660
YOU ASTONISH Me! BRING BACK YOURSELF!!

288
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,630
Your crew has a faith inébranlable in you as a captain, Luffy with the straw hat.

289
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,110
Faith.

290
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,660
Psss, it is the most useless thing in the world.

291
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,930
It is what its problem with this puffiness?

292
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,410
It fout of us…

293
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,060
The calm one! You will become nutcase!

294
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,750
CROCODILE!

295
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,570
VIVI!

296
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,510
Be the welcome, Princesse of Arabasta, Vivi.

297
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,570
Or rather should I say, Miss Wednesday.

298
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,750
You managed formidably well to escape the claws from your assassins.

299
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,170
I would have come.
It was useless to hide you!

300
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,880
I would have come to see you dying!

301
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,300
Mr. O!

302
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,010
If you had never posed the foot in my country…

303
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,410
Wait, Vivi!

304
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,550
Make leave to us from there.

305
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,990
… Arabasta would be always in peace!

306
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,920
Make leave to us!

307
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:09,990
Vivi!

308
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,330
Useless.

309
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,710
You are satisfied?

310
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,640
Being originating in this country, should be well-informed to you already…

311
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,880
… that I have the capacity of the Fruit Suna Suna.

312
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,880
Suna = Sand

313
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,650
Will I transform you into mummy?

314
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,080
A sand man!

315
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,830
HEY YOU! Leave Vivi!

316
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,180
I will explode you the mouth!

317
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,480
You sit.

318
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,590
It that the festival starts, isn't it is time, Miss All Sunday?

319
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,250
Yes.

320
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,600
A festival?

321
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,710
It is last midday.

322
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,160
The Utopia operation officially started.

323
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,400
“The Utopia operation”?

324
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,960
Utopia operation… It is what that?

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,800
It is the death of this pathetic kingdom, Miss Wednesday.

326
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,550
The blind love for Arabasta will be the only thing which will lead it to its loss!

327
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:46,040
The people of this country will be wrapped eternal darkness, fighting and struggling constantly between the life and death.

328
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,920
The Utopia operation…

329
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,000
… started!

1
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:18,150
The island which lives under snow
The rise of Drum Rockies!

2
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,900
I will take you along there.

3
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,890
Then do not die now.

4
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,910
Nami.

5
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,650
Sanji.

6
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,059
Ah! Look in front!

7
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,800
It is them, wapol-Sama!

8
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,630
WAIT! KID!

9
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,010
What? You are who you?

10
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,180
How oses you still to humiliate me?

11
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,060
I you will make it regret!

12
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,100
Release!

13
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,920
Wapol uses the word hippopotamus
(Kaba) Instead of idiot, naive (Baka)

14
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,070
Which hippopotamus?

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Why 
I should release?

16
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,310
The girl on your back and the type that
you carry have the air almost died.

17
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,759
Wait!

18
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,290
Ah, that is there!

19
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,439
Chess!

20
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,610
I come just from
to find a new law.

21
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,369
Write that.

22
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,149
Yes!

23
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,840
“Whoever will ignore the King will be carried out

24
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,280
at once
! “

25
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
You two!

26
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,409
I will start with those
who are unaware of me more!

27
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,470
Kill the patient and the casualty initially!

28
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,250
What do you say?

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,709
Leave me the girl!

30
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,480
I undertake the unconscious type!

31
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,940
Take that!

32
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,070
Listen, Luffy!

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,490
No matter what it arrives, you
do not have especially to fight!

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,950
If you start the combat
or take a blow,

35
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,990
it will be Nami-San which
in the shock will support!

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,850
SHIT!!

37
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,440
I WILL REMEMBER IT!

38
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,850
DO NOT FOLLOW ME!

39
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,520
Species of coward!

40
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,520
Ca is not used for nothing!

41
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,040
Let us show him

42
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,920
how we fight
in a snow-covered country.

43
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,000
What?

44
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,330
They are not there any more…

45
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,550
How is that done?

46
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,390
Did they give up?

47
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,989
Here our speciality.

48
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,350
The hiding-place in snow!

49
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,070
If you are also weak,
you will die at once!

50
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,159
You lost!

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,790
STOP!!

52
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,360
Ours polaires?

53
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,440
Of Lapahn?

54
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,349
Did they protect them?

55
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,509
It is right a coincidence.

56
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,940
Lapahn are not
friends with the human ones.

57
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,900
You…

58
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,729
Thank you!

59
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,800
Thank you for your assistance!

60
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,729
Do not let them escape!

61
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,710
Yes!

62
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,290
What does that want to say?

63
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,560
Doctor…

64
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,440
Doctor…

65
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,020
Doctor…

66
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,480
Here it is…

67
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,240
I cannot even see the top of it.

68
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,790
There high,

69
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,300
there is a doctor.

70
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,520
Hold out still a little…

71
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,500
Nami, Sanji!

72
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,490
An avalanche…

73
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,690
It carried us.

74
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,850
Usopp-San?

75
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,030
USOPP-SAN!

76
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,640
Usopp-San!

77
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,760
Hold good!

78
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,380
Awake!

79
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,300
It is always in life.

80
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,210
Usopp-San,
cling!

81
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,049
Cling,
Usopp-San!

82
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,410
Usopp-San!

83
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,730
That there is, Vivi
? Let sleep to me.

84
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,889
I was in the train of
to make a fantastic dream.

85
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,919
It was in a marvellous world,

86
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,450
with fields of flowers
splendid and of the superb rivers.

87
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,339
REMAIN HERE!

88
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,029
Ah the river, the river…

89
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,160
Rendors not! Upright!

90
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,540
Now, come! 74.000 members
crews of Usopp the pirate!

91
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,269
Not! Awake please!

92
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,420
Usopp-San, do not die!

93
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,890
Usopp!

94
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,569
Usopp!

95
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,019
Usopp!

96
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,479
Usopp!

97
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,069
Usopp!

98
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,399
Usopp!

99
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,680
Usopp-Saaan!

100
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,319
Ah! You saved me, Vivi.

101
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,430
It is thus that which one
invite to return from the hell!

102
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,120
It is brilliant, I am in life, but…

103
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,829
It is me, or is this
what my head is swollen?

104
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,869
This are
engelures, of engelures.

105
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,999
It is me or my head is heavier?

106
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,169
These countries of snows
are dangerous, you know.

107
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,460
It is me or my field
of is vision smaller?

108
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,340
It is necessary to hurry.

109
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,999
It is necessary that one gathers our information
and that one gives a progress report on our situation.

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,610
Ouais, it is surely with
cause my imagination.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,190
WHAT SE PASSES?

112
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,709
I give up.

113
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,780
I saw a field of flowers…

114
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,090
It is too cold. And
this whore of avalanche!

115
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,980
But good, that must be like
a bath in an ice-cold water.

116
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,940
Zoro?

117
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,790
Oh, Vivi!

118
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,020
Ah, it is you, Usopp!

119
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,370
What did you make?

120
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,310
It would be rather with
us to ask it to you.

121
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,200
Cretins of animals!

122
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,450
You, miserable rabbits, have
tried to oppose to you to the king!

123
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,620
I must admit well that I did not think of having
need for all my power against a rabbit band.

124
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,349
You did not can make differently.

125
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,850
It is the species more
wild of the Kingdom of Drum.

126
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,270
I arrive…

127
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,510
HAT OF PAAAILLLEEE!!

128
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,540
Doctor…

129
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,630
Doc.… tor…

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,380
Doctor!

131
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,240
IEA!

132
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,670
SANJIII!!!

133
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,860
It was right…

134
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,359
A winter bath?

135
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Ouais.

136
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,270
I swam in the river and, all
with blow, I did not know any more where I was.

137
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,190
Then, I moved away towards the broad one, I lost sight of the fact the bank and I lost myself in wood.

138
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,459
Completely naked?

139
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,709
, You are to you a moron know?

140
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,709
I of insane Usopp,
lend to me your coat.

141
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,810
Out of the question.

142
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,540
I wonder whether Nami-San is not
patient because of this mental tiredness.

143
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,139
Your shoes then!

144
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,900
Not.

145
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,429
A shoe.

146
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,760
Not!!!

147
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,600
You must pay for your errors.

148
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,309
Look at that.

149
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,380
These people who are over there.

150
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,020
These constructions me
say something.

151
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,650
You are right!

152
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,449
It is Bighorn!

153
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,780
We returned to
our starting point!

154
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,420
You draw aside!!

155
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,260
Dalton already died!

156
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,089
It is not sufficient to kill Dalton!

157
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,000
You were the soldiers of Dalton!

158
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,690
Don't you feel anything?

159
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,589
We serve our King, Wapol!

160
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,300
Those which are opposed to
Wapol-Sama will be killed!

161
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,760
He. What occurs?

162
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,580
You requests what occurs…

163
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,970
You would not like rather to know
why be equipped to you like that?

164
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,690
Dalton-San… is buried
under an avalanche!

165
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,470
Dalton-San?

166
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,540
Yes…

167
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,990
But, because of them, one
cannot leave it snow!

168
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,500
You draw aside!
You draw aside!

169
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,200
All those which have a problem, approach you
and show us what you are able!

170
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,350
Usopp.

171
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,550
I already saw these front uniforms.

172
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,980
These are those that one
met at sea.

173
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,200
I am right?

174
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,629
Yes, that with the air.

175
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,719
Thus they are our enemies.

176
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,239
Hein?

177
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,799
Enemies.

178
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,049
Euh?

179
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,339
What are they then? Allies?

180
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,059
Euh. They are enemies, but…

181
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,410
What that made?

182
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,440
You are afraid, even without Dalton here?

183
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,920
Mr. Bushido!

184
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,130
Who is this?

185
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,809
He, you! Stop!

186
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,530
You are causing them!

187
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,680
Pretty and hot! I take it!

188
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,520
You attacked it for that?

189
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,300
He, looks at! They have
air irritated now!

190
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,750
You!

191
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,660
You were on the same boat as
the guy who overcame Wapol-Sama!

192
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,320
You are a little slow with
relaxation, comrade.

193
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,980
You seek…

194
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
that?

195
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,980
Kill it!

196
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,500
What? Already finished?

197
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,220
What a band of nazes!

198
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,080
Incredible.

199
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,989
Well!

200
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,310
Good work, Zoro!

201
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,720
You followed my instructions!

202
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,689
Let us find Dalton-San!

203
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,510
Ouais!

204
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,260
Thank you very much!

205
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,309
We dispatch!

206
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,170
Dig here!

207
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,780
Eh well? What occurs here?

208
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,259
You will wonder it later.

209
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,940
We must help them!

210
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,060
Dalton-San… Remain
in life please!

211
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,320
Doctor!

212
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,140
Doctor!

213
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,110
Doctor!!

214
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,630
Hold good…

215
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,490
One is there almost.

216
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,000
Do not die!

217
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,680
I arrived there.

218
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,640
Doctor…

219
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,270
Doctorine…

220
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,110
The antibodies react.

221
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,020
Yes.

222
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,920
It is normal.

223
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,730
Then, which is
this disease causes?

224
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,370
Can you say it?

225
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,800
Kestia.

226
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,840
It is exact. It is Kestia.

227
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,370
Deal with the girl.

228
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,110
Yes.

229
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,390
Who?

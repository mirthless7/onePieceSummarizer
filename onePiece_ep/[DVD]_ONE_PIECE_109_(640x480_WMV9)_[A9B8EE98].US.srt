1
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:21,290
The key of the destiny and the great escape!

2
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:21,290
Doru Doru Ball!

3
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,220
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,700
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,110
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,170
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,190
The plan of Crocodile extremely well started.

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,140
In Nanohana, Good-Clay took the appearance of the King.

9
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,130
From this fact… the rebellious army passed to the action.

10
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,330
During this time, vis-a-vis the danger with which Luffy and its crew are confronted with Rain Dinners,

11
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,330
Vivi managed to escape to seek the assistance of Sanji and Chopper.

12
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,880
Will Arabasta be destroyed?

13
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,880
Or will it find peace eternal?

14
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,260
The countdown of the sand glass of the destiny arrives in the long term.

15
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,100
I am Mr. Prince!

16
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,000
Is Tony-Kun a lure?

17
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,800
Ouais.

18
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,960
All will go well for him.

19
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,770
We, Vivi-Chan dispatch.

20
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,920
Say to me what occurred!

21
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,420
But Sanji-San… I believed that one had drawn you above…

22
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,950
Me?

23
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,410
Hello?

24
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,320
We had it.

25
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,950
What do we have to make of this type?

26
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,260
Where are you?

27
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,480
Give your position!

28
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,220
We are in Rainbase in front of the doors of the casino Rain Dinners.

29
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,900
Well, you were wise.

30
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,770
A superb interpretation.

31
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,150
Now your boss will leave.

32
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,590
Thank you, Mister.

33
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,990
P- Do I can go there, now?

34
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,710
No Sir.

35
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,910
I did not believe in it…

36
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,590
Look at, Chopper!

37
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,710
Still more their men gathered where we were presently.

38
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,050
Ouais.

39
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,650
Now, it is with me to play.

40
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,420
Ouais.

41
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,120
I count on you.

42
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,890
What do you want?

43
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,060
My name is Mr. Prince.

44
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,330
Thus it is you, the dumb who put our pals in this state!?

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,850
With me to play…

46
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,180
My name is Mr. Prince!

47
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,320
My name is Mr. Prince!

48
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,570
Brothel, that did occur here?

49
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,640
L- The type which is made call “Mr. Prince”…

50
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,100
He.

51
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,980
Oh not!

52
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,680
The bridge crumbled!

53
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,570
And it is more or less what occurred.

54
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,590
Will that go for Tony-Kun?

55
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,350
Ouais.

56
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,020
It has more than one turn in its bag.

57
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,510
What did it occur to Rain Dinners?

58
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,500
I intended to say that the bridge had crumbled.

59
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,260
The dumb…

60
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,080
Where do you hide you, Mr. Prince?

61
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,380
I will seek you and I will kill you.

62
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,810
Water!

63
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,860
We will mouriiiir!

64
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,860
Water! Water! Water!

65
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,680
If the cage fills, we are foutus!!

66
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,560
Stupid He croco!

67
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,410
Be given to bottom!

68
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,240
What do you make, Nami!?

69
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,850
I want to make it furious so that it breaks this cage!

70
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,680
I included/understood! Excellent idea!

71
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,130
Come there, stupid banana!

72
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
Blasted banana!

73
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
Not, you are mistaken!

74
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,270
You see well that it is a crocodile.

75
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,770
The banana pushes on its head.

76
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,610
Be inflating to you… Close it!

77
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,320
For example, take “Monkey Dance”…

78
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,260
He banana!

79
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,720
Listen when somebody speaks to you!

80
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,590
What?

81
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,650
For example, take “Monkey Dance”.

82
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,130
The monkey is an animal, but “Monkey Dance” is a dance.

83
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,230
Do not touch with that!

84
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,680
Pay attention!

85
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,590
The bananas and the crocodiles, both eat themselves!

86
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,710
It arrives!

87
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,510
Ca did not go!

88
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,390
What is it that this cage!?

89
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,650
Vivi, hurries!

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,180
He, you.

91
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,000
How can you remain also calm!?

92
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,410
Think of a means to leave us from here!

93
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,710
Say to me what you know…

94
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,190
Which is the objective of Crocodile?

95
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,740
This woman who was with Crocodile…

96
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,670
… has been sought by the world government for 20 years.

97
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,610
The reward for its capture exceeds the 70.000.000.

98
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,640
70.000.000!?

99
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,510
E- And then!?

100
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,630
It is as much as for Crocodile…

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,180
If these deux-là works together,

102
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,730
it is not a question any more of reversing a country.

103
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,370
If they are not stopped, that will involve a disaster for the whole world.

104
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,780
The whole world?

105
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,960
What do you want to say?

106
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,280
Maintaining it is too important to engage there.

107
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,790
About what do speak you?

108
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,730
Since when must we have a reason to burst a guy like him!?

109
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,190
Very well.

110
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,120
Then…

111
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,130
How will you make to leave from here?

112
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Water already reached my buttocks!!

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,550
We will die!
We will die! Naaan!

114
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,090
Ah, I empty myself my forces…

115
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,950
Oh shit!

116
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,160
Ca fears!

117
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,380
Hold good, brothel!

118
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,180
It is what Vivi said, not true!?

119
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,080
Vivi, that must really be hard for you…

120
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,660
You are so in a hurry, I am sorry!

121
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,030
Shit…

122
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,890
If I were a better epeist…

123
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,390
… this cage would not be a problem!

124
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,900
“Never not to make noise when one eats.”

125
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,980
Then the guy.

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,330
Did I make you wait?

127
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,950
Prince-San!

128
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,110
We are saved…

129
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,160
Stop glander and finds the key now!

130
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,790
Nami-Saaan!

131
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,580
E- Do you like me!?

132
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,990
Yes, yes.

133
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,010
Yes, I love you.

134
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,820
Now the door opens!

135
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,390
I arriiive!

136
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,420
Its stupidity is unbounded…

137
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,670
Mellorine! Mellorine!

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Vivi! Played well!

139
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,510
Look at, they arrive all at the same time.

140
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,510
Go ahead Sanji!

141
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,140
Burst to them all!

142
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,440
It does not matter your number, try me to beat, bananas of shit.

143
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,210
All merdeux enough louts to attack a woman…

144
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,140
… require that the good mannerss are inculcated to them.

145
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,670
Sanji! We do not have time!

146
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,720
Butt to them all in one second!
Not, in one moment!

147
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,820
Butt the third which has just entered the part.

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,790
What?

149
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,230
How can you know that?

150
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,890
You are cretin and deaf?

151
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,950
This growl.

152
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,360
It is the same growl as that which swallowed the key.

153
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,530
I do not arrive there…

154
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,190
It destroyed the bridge to save time.

155
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,630
What wants to say that it has more companions than envisaged.

156
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,220
Thus it tried to pass to us under the nose to go in the part.

157
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,400
Probably.

158
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,000
Ca arrives!

159
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,840
The key of the cage!

160
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,450
What is it that this trick?

161
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,230
Ca does not resemble a key!

162
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,950
Saved!

163
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,010
What!?

164
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,840
D- Water!

165
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,170
Water all around me!

166
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,890
They is really miraculous!

167
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,830
He! It is this type…!?

168
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,430
3!

169
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,340
3!

170
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,920
Mr. 3!

171
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,720
Why were you in the stomach of the crocodile!?

172
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,100
I live again!

173
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,940
I thought of being at the end of the roller!

174
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,250
Crocodile, if you wanted to remove you from me, you will have to better do.

175
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,480
At the moment when I was going to be devoured by this animal,

176
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,140
I used my last forces to make this Doru Doru Ball and…

177
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,450
What do we have there?

178
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,870
This key!

179
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,080
Give it!

180
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,550
Still you…!!

181
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,710
What?

182
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,160
Their to give this key?

183
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,640
Wait.

184
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,720
A closed part which fills of water.

185
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,030
A steel cage.

186
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,030
And… a key.

187
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,290
I included/understood what occurs.

188
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,040
Therefore, you are Mr. 3?

189
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,300
“You launched me.”

190
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,510
Es you Mr. 3?

191
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,530
Give me this key well nicely.

192
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,040
I know…

193
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,400
What do you say a launched length?

194
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,270
What!?

195
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,250
I do not know who you are, but you must be one as of theirs.

196
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,390
If you want the key, will seek it!

197
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,710
On the other hand, I am not responsible if you do not find it!

198
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,710
Dumb…

199
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,660
What would it occur if they found the crocodile which swallowed the key?

200
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Ca will not be useful to them with nothing.

201
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,550
Even if they managed to find the good crocodile,

202
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,620
it is always me which have the true key.

203
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,000
Even while being given to bottom, that will not be sufficient.

204
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,360
You are diabolic.

205
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,110
It is not there any more!

206
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,500
It disappeared!

207
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,590
This dumb…

208
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,380
He is intelligent to have included/understood all that so quickly!

209
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,560
We do not have any more time!

210
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,620
Sanji-Kun!

211
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,110
Which shit, you are making me…

212
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,560
One second, Sanji!

213
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,260
Couldn't it make a key for this cage thanks to its capacity Doru Doru?

214
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,250
Good idea.

215
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,100
Eh?

216
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,160
Good work, “man candle”.

217
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,660
Can one go there?
It does not remain us much any more of time.

218
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,370
Ouais.

219
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,980
The tunnel which they took earlier…

220
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,580
… must lead to Alubarna.

221
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,210
But there is still too much Bananawani blocking the passage!

222
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,480
It is all!?

223
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,210
Where is the remainder?!!!

224
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,430
They will not be a problem.

225
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,070
And to say that I had so much evil to fight only one of them…

226
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,570
Not, not.

227
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,110
It is their force which is not normal.

228
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,990
It is not your fault.

229
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,990
Brothel!

230
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,020
I cannot go there seriously with all this sea water!

231
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,290
The wall yielded!

232
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,650
Moron!

233
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,640
You do too much of it!

234
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,000
Even the passage crumbles!

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,900
It is time to leave!

236
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,160
Let us leave from here!

237
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,610
I have of it enough of these poisoning small plagues.

238
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,770
It is time that I finish them myself.

239
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,290
What…?

240
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,410
With later - Croco of shit - Mr. Prince

241
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,310
Are He, alive for you, Luffy?

242
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,100
Usopp-San! Awake!

243
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,010
Shit!

244
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,850
What be to you making?

245
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,020
Awake and swims!

246
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,640
Whore, those which have the capacities of a fruit of the demon take large risks.

247
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,100
Smoker!

248
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,650
He, He, Zoro!

249
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,060
Why did you help the enemy?

250
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,150
Close it!

251
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,700
I did not want.

252
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,800
It was the ideal moment to get rid of him.

253
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,640
Anything.

254
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,170
We do not have any more but to go there!

255
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,030
We lost a good end of time in it.

256
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,570
Can Vivi-Chan, one arrive still there?

257
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,020
I do not know.

258
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,620
Nami-San.

259
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,230
Do you still have this perfume which I bought in Nanohana?

260
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,780
Eh?

261
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,770
Yes, why?

262
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,580
Put.

263
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,700
Like that?

264
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,370
Ah! Until the end of the world!
To fall in love!

265
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,410
Stop joking and allons-y!

266
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,900
Roronoa!

267
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,180
Why did you save me?

268
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,450
He, Zoro!

269
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,900
Save it!

270
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,670
Hein!?

271
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,980
It is an enemy!

272
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,830
Let us leave it!

273
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,620
But if we leave it… he will die!

274
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,120
It is an anvil!

275
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Not, I want to say… I know all that!

276
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,170
But it is…!!

277
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,220
I followed the orders of the Captain.

278
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,390
Do not believe that you must thank me.

279
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,330
It was one of its whims.

280
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,380
Forget that.

281
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,110
Then, I suppose that you me will not want of it if I exert my official duties.

282
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,120
You hear that? Here what one gains to save somebody of the Navy.

283
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,130
You found the pirates of Straw hat?

284
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,020
Yes, and Colonel Smoker is over there too!

285
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,540
We will lend strong hand to him!

286
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,500
Yes!

287
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,250
Very well, my men!

288
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,250
We go right to Alubarna!

289
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,970
Where is Crocodile!?

290
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,990
Ah, they finally regained consciousness.

291
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,150
Smokey! You want to fight!?

292
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,570
Gah!! Smoker!

293
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,490
He, Luffy, do not do that!

294
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,350
Let us leave!

295
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,250
Is it serious, there?

296
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,680
By there!

297
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,750
More quickly!

298
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,800
Leave.

299
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,710
But it is the last time that I let to you slip by.

300
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,310
The next time that we will meet, you died.

301
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
They are there!

302
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,410
Move back, Colonel Smoker!

303
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,590
He!

304
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,060
Do not let them escape!

305
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,130
Yes!

306
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,950
Allons-y.

307
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,160
The Navy arrives.

308
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,060
It is by where Alubarna?

309
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,190
By there!

310
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,150
Full Is!

311
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,400
Luffy, hurries!

312
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,490
What do you make?

313
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,290
Ouais…

314
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,690
They will not flee this time!

315
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,250
Yes!

316
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,680
You know, I taime well!

317
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,540
Insane the camp now!!

318
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,490
They go by there!

319
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,350
Halt!

320
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,240
All after them!

321
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,950
More quickly! More quickly! More quickly!!

322
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,910
Yosh!

323
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,300
The guy, we go right to Alubarna!

324
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,780
Ouais!!!

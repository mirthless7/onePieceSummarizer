1
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:21,320
Luffy attacked by the magic!

2
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:21,320
Color trap

3
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,210
Brogy-San!

4
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,100
And now, my Candle Service!

5
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,490
Transform them into wax statues!

6
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,570
My hands cannot move any more!

7
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,230
I do not want to die like that!

8
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,900
One can thus nothing make?

9
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,610
He, Ossan.

10
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,630
Would Ca say to you to butt these guys with me?

11
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,130
One tests?

12
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,800
There I will not let to you only go!

13
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,940
What do you believe capacity to make?

14
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,270
I go you botter the bottom!

15
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,660
What?

16
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,170
They destroyed the duel of the giants-Ossan!

17
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,970
Brogy Master!
We are here to avenge your sorrow!

18
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,190
Usopp…

19
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
Before that, Luffy…

20
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,300
Wouldn't Ca say to you to break this pillar initially?

21
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,630
I will leave them afterwards to you.

22
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,740
Okay!

23
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,150
I do not think.

24
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,170
Destroy the pillar, Luffy!

25
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,720
Do Zoro, what you make?

26
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,510
If I become a statue, I would like that it is in this installation.

27
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,550
It is not the moment to joke!

28
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,920
I do not joke.

29
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,690
In any case, do something for your legs.

30
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,190
I have badly only by looking at them.

31
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,820
Then does not look at!

32
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,270
And in any event, I said to you that it was stupid to try to cut your legs and to flee.

33
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,920
It is not that. I would have cut them to be able to beat me.

34
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,770
It is even more stupid.
You were to joke!

35
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,690
The farm.

36
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,930
Good blood, you do not have really any good sense.

37
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,920
We are loins of being able us to leave there,

38
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,760
and they do not seem anxious whole.

39
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,030
Do He kid, you give up already the combat?

40
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,780
Ouais, one will say that this time it is necessary to let another fight.

41
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,660
I see.

42
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,690
Mr. 3, these people have the air really quiet.

43
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,270
And you also, Miss Week Golden delicious!

44
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,640
Whore…

45
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,250
He, you would make better take the installation now.

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,160
Do not mingle me with your odd ideas!

47
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,160
Mr. Bushido, be serious please!

48
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,210
I am always serious.

49
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,900
This is why you are so stupid.

50
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,900
You are the last person to be able to say that to me!

51
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,110
It would be said that one does not represent any more one threat for them.

52
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,110
What does that want to say?

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,590
It is more enrageant.

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,900
Since this man arrived, they…

55
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,530
Impossible!

56
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,670
Yosha!

57
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,740
However, in my opinion, it does not resemble somebody on whom one can count.

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,970
Mr. 3!

59
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,040
Let finish it to us!

60
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,970
To finish?

61
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,780
You must joke?

62
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,720
Look at it!

63
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,960
Your attacks were ineffective.
It is for that it is held in front of us living.

64
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,110
This man cannot apparently be overcome by somebody of your level.

65
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,520
You two, occupy you others.

66
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,010
I will personally add Luffy to the straw hat to my collection of wax statues.

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,640
You never close it, vermins?

68
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,990
Bastard, you went too far!

69
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,470
Give up as much as you can it!

70
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,040
Small fry.

71
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,800
Allons-y!

72
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,770
Well, the preparations are ready!

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
I cover you Luffy!

74
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,070
You said something?

75
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,750
Go, it left!

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,760
What is it that?

77
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,190
Luffy-San?

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,240
What, it was already made have?

79
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,940
Asshole!

80
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,960
What is it that?

81
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,740
It is heavier than a hammer.

82
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,340
It was too easy.

83
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,070
And now, your hands!

84
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,350
Ouahou, it is perfect!

85
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,290
Giant-Ossan!

86
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,050
I borrow you for one moment!

87
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,220
What?

88
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,530
What does it try to make?

89
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,320
Tonkachi = Hammer

90
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,810
Brilliant!

91
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,090
What a chance! The hammer with my feet broke!

92
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,580
We are alive…

93
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,910
Saved!

94
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,510
The situation did not change a hair!

95
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,220
It was right!
Why you did not run?

96
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,880
One cannot move!
You do not see it?

97
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,440
Oh, indeed one would say that you cannot.

98
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,760
But said you to me to break the pillar.

99
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,890
You joked?

100
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,260
Can one really give our lives between his hands, Mr. Bushido?

101
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,280
At the point where are we, we do not have the choice.

102
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,540
My arms already hardened.

103
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,870
I beg you, are serious now!

104
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,840
Wait, my body hardens more and more quickly.

105
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,580
I cannot move any part of my body!

106
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,290
Cretin!

107
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,390
To have brought closer the candles to you accelerates solidification!

108
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,690
Now you with being prepare my wax statues!

109
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,540
This bastard! To play with people as he wants it!

110
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,650
Do He, you transform itself into wax statues?

111
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,650
It is what one says to you!

112
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,730
Hurry to break this thing, Luffy-San!

113
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,790
Okay, I included/understood!

114
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,280
I will not let myself intervene!

115
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,760
I said to you not to intervene!

116
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,860
Arts mori = wax Harpoon

117
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,290
Not spiced enough.

118
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,220
You must use powder with the reduction.

119
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
It swallowed my Kayakuboshi…

120
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,540
They is not good.

121
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,820
Ca stiffens.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Fortunately that I could take this installation.

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,350
Cretin!

124
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,600
Luffy-San! Hurry please!

125
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,370
Is Yosh, it this pumpkin which does that, not?

126
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,560
Hold good!

127
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,200
It is useless!

128
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,800
He, out of my way!

129
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,470
It would be rather with me to say that!

130
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,810
I must insist that you do not interfere with my Article.

131
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,130
I have a new hammer!

132
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:10,920
Oh not!

133
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,070
Mr. 3!

134
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,810
Impossible!

135
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,650
Luffy, hurries to break this trick while you have a chance!

136
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,260
Not.

137
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,570
Stop joking and do it!

138
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,780
Not.

139
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,600
It is not the moment to make the idiot!

140
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,870
Luffy-San please!

141
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,100
Why would I have?

142
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,120
I do not want to save you.

143
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,970
What do you tell?

144
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,770
Color Trap!

145
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,070
He! Luffy!

146
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,710
One cannot about it any more!

147
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,640
Stop making the idiot and helps us!

148
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,390
Yes.

149
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,660
I included/understood.

150
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,440
If you include/understand, magne!

151
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,420
Yes Luffy!

152
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,580
I included/understood but…

153
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,520
But, I do not want to save you.

154
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,850
What do you want to say exactly?

155
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,750
One transforms oneself into wax statues, you include/understand?

156
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,030
We will die!

157
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,140
Ouais… But I do not feel it.

158
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,860
One of fout that you feel it or not!!

159
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,740
This cretin… who does it arrive to him?

160
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,040
If it does not hurry,
our companions will die!

161
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,540
I will clear up the ideas to him!

162
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,790
Allons-y, Karu!

163
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,620
You were there!

164
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,690
Give up! It already fell into a trap.

165
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,360
Completely. Can you see the mark on which it is held upright?

166
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,680
On which it is?

167
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,500
Hum… Let us see that…

168
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,100
Brothel, there is a kind of black drawing strange over there.

169
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,500
What is it to the Juste?

170
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,570
It is right ordinary painting.

171
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,130
Painting?

172
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,300
For all to say to you, you two,

173
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,230
as well as the others,

174
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,010
you all will die together.

175
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,530
Karu, one must be folded up for the moment!

176
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,910
It tries to escape with the bird!

177
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,360
Let us continue them!

178
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,980
Sink right in front!

179
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,160
He! Cretin!
I am not yet on you!

180
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,930
Karu!

181
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,900
Eh well, stops!
Let go up to me!

182
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,430
Why are you afraid of me?

183
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,480
Let climb to me!

184
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,980
Miss Week Golden delicious.

185
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,090
It is you the person in charge!

186
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,910
Uragiri No kuro = the black which betrays

187
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,340
Once you touch black painting, even if your team-members are invaluable for you,

188
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,940
you will betray them!

189
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,670
What does she say?

190
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,890
Say to me what she tells.

191
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,670
It is a “realistic painter”. She can make real the emotion which a color evokes.

192
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,550
Its refined drawings enable him to directly influence the spirit with coloured painting.

193
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,800
“To influence” do you say?
They is not good!

194
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,620
This simple ball of spirit is even more sensitive to the suggestions than the normal!

195
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,730
Therefore, we must just make it move EC painting, it is that?

196
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,610
Luffy, you must move…

197
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,350
Not like that!

198
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,890
Luffy-San, please does not move of the circle of black painting! No matter what it arrives!

199
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,120
Vivi, why?

200
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,430
We do not want that you save us!

201
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,490
Not.

202
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,000
I include/understand.

203
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,910
Is necessary to say the opposite to be sure that it betrays us.

204
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:39,820
Hein?

205
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,820
I felt odd during one minute.

206
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,050
Luffy-San, quickly!

207
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,890
Yosh! I will save you the guy!

208
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,140
But now that I think of it, I prefer laughter!

209
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,000
Why?

210
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,240
You…

211
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,500
What now?

212
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,010
Warai No kiiro = laughing yellow

213
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,080
Cretin, was not necessary to move of this spot!

214
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,510
It is on its clothing.

215
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,880
Luffy! Hurry to take off your tee-shirt!

216
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,970
Not, it is more important to laugh now!

217
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,060
Whore!

218
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,020
At the speed to which fall this powder, we have some for one minute at the maximum.

219
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,350
Are cretins, you there to amuse you or what?

220
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,850
Look at! When Usopp and Karu ran up against it, they erased painting on its back!

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,880
You still had me.

222
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,330
He, you! Remove that immediately unpleasant plague!

223
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,280
My wasn't Warai No kiiro amusing?

224
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,860
The farm! Stupid child! Idiot!

225
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,520
At all events, I must break this pumpkin!

226
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,100
Tougyuu No aka = Red of the mad bull

227
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,360
Where did you aim whore?

228
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,070
You should not break that!
Mr. 3 will be irritated.

229
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,630
What is it that?

230
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,180
A such bull charging a red cape,

231
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,000
you will attack only this red mark.

232
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,130
Damage for you.

233
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,400
You me tirednesses!

234
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,070
Release from there!!

235
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,450
It is funny?

236
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,320
It is useless!

237
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,660
All is against him.

238
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,200
Its force does not have any effect on it.

239
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,710
Now, I will mix Warai No kiiro of your back with my kanashimi No ao and…

240
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,300
Kanashimi No ao = Blue of sadness

241
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,330
Nagomi No midori = alleviating green

242
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,120
Ah, this tea is very good…

243
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,470
Be idiotic for you or what?

244
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,760
Good… and now?

245
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,660
He! I had said to you to take the installation when you still had the chance of it.

246
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,930
Now you must be disgusted.

247
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,330
How can you be still also unconscious?

248
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,550
Shit! How can they run also quickly?

249
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,060
Missed!

250
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,200
Karu good work!

251
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,060
And here is the ransom!

252
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,820
Namari Boshi = Explosion hoisted which undoubtedly kills!

253
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,360
We direct towards Luffy and the others!

254
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,850
We will not catch them while running simply.

255
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:25,670
Indeed.

256
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,700
I did not want to use it for similar waste but we will not be able to pass some to us.

257
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,290
Revolver Flint Lock Gauges 44,6 blows.

258
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,200
A new model of South Blue.

259
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
Excel for the fast shooting.

260
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,090
And when I use it, the balls are invisible.

261
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,740
Reason of the odd behavior of Luffy,

262
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,600
as said it the two others,

263
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,370
it is this painting!

264
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,380
It is that the cause!

265
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,390
When I ran up against Luffy presently,

266
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,860
it had some on the back!

267
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,370
No the possible doubt!

268
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,520
If I can do something for painting…

269
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,160
More quickly!

270
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,540
This tea is very good.

271
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,110
This tea…

272
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,250
Luffy! What you…

273
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,760
This tea

274
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,770
is very good!

275
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,670
What do you insane, salt stunned?

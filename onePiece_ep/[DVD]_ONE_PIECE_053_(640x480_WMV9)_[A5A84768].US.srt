1
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:05,960
A legend was born!

2
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:05,960
Direction:Large Line

3
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,480
I WILL BECOME THE LORD OF THE PIRATES!!!

4
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,160
A storm approaches…
Largest that I ever saw!

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,350
Afflicted.
I died!

6
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,680
He, I am alive!

7
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,350
It is O.K. !

8
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,020
Did it know that it was going to be saved?

9
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,710
It would be said that the Sky itself
makes a point of preserving the life of this young man…

10
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,670
Dispatch we to leave from here!

11
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,240
Let us go to Grand Line!
Yahoo!

12
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,540
The wish that I transmitted.

13
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,140
Destiny of Time and the dream of the Men.

14
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,100
These are things that it is impossible to stop.

15
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,750
As a long time as these Men
will pursue the Key of Freedom,

16
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,230
nothing will be able to prevent some!

17
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Pirate?

18
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,260
That is appropriate to me…

19
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,550
But about which kind of storm is it?

20
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,180
If one does not accelerate, one will not be able to leave this island any more.

21
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,180
Nami-San did not joke while saying to us
to return as quickly as possible to the ship!

22
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,450
Run! Run! Run!

23
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,370
Technique mortal:

24
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,890
Afflicted…

25
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,240
That is not used for nothing to attack me.

26
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,390
There is no man in this able world
of touching my sublime skin.

27
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,390
I dreamed of a field of flowers…

28
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,780
Buggy captain, you are still in life!

29
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,040
As if I could die…

30
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,690
Buggy, attention, they are soldiers of
general headquarter of the Navy.

31
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,240
The Navy does not arrive to us at ankle…

32
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,690
Buggy confuses with will haikara = eccentric

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,690
Who said that my nose was eccentric?

34
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,430
But I did not say anything of the whole!

35
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,540
What does one make?

36
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,390
Continue the elastic kid!

37
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,230
Moji and Ritchie already had to reduce
all boats in ashes.

38
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
They cannot leave the island any more!

39
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,510
Let us stop good once for all and
let us let us go, companions!

40
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,850
Engine!

41
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,350
Yes, Captain!

42
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,620
Spark-ignition engine, lit!

43
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,410
Install Gelaende!

44
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,410
Slope for German ski jump

45
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,460
Yes, Alvida-Neesan!

46
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,490
Do not let these pirates escape!

47
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,910
It is what this smoke?

48
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,500
What is it?

49
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,060
Smoker!

50
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,420
He, waste.
I do not have time to play with you!

51
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,490
Incredible…

52
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,360
It is the capacity of the Fruit Moku Moku.

53
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,520
It caught all the band of Buggy of only one blow!

54
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,320
Fire!

55
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,620
Captain, we all are prisoners!

56
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,220
Dirtiness of Smoker!

57
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,750
Does the metal net have something of special or what?

58
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,530
They left it thanks to their odd guns!

59
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,760
It is a special net invented by the Navy for
to neutralize the capacities of the Fruits of the Demon.

60
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,760
Shit.

61
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,440
Seek my Billower Bike!
I will leave to research Straw hat.

62
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:21,940
Yes!

63
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,880
It is heavy!

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,690
The Vogue-Merry is in danger!

65
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,750
It is possible that the Navy already found it.

66
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,670
We must hurry! More quickly!

67
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,350
Nami! Nami!

68
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,790
Can I of débarasser, please?

69
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,640
Of course that not!

70
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,750
I can about it more!

71
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,470
Shit!

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,690
Why it rains suddenly?

73
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,050
How will I make to burn the ship?

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,380
Shit!

75
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,570
Afflicted Ritchie, I do not manage to make fire.

76
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,110
I retente!

77
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,960
Patience, Ritchie…
I will give you to eat afterwards.

78
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,920
What do you make?

79
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,140
Moji!

80
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,450
You here.

81
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,960
Attacks, Ritchie!

82
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,920
Ultimate fresh egg throw!

83
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,720
You…

84
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,870
Thin, my hands slipped because of the rain!

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,750
Ritchie!

86
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,300
Salt degenerated lion!

87
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,470
Now, one goes up on board!

88
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,030
Do not move any more!

89
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,270
I will deal with you!

90
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,060
Being the right-hand man of the Buggy captain,

91
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,210
me, Moji-Sama, I will not let to you pose a foot on your ship!

92
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,030
Gunners in position!

93
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,600
Navy?

94
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,740
Thin…

95
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,790
Out of cheek!

96
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,230
Fire!

97
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,570
Carry a message to the gunners:

98
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,170
say to them to aim this pirate vessel!

99
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:10,870
Yes!

100
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,070
Nami!

101
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,600
By where to join the ocean?

102
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,100
It rains too much, I do not even manage to see where one goes!

103
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,550
Here they are!

104
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,240
Thin… You do not want to stop you for of débarasser?

105
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,680
Not, there are not time…

106
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,590
Who is this Lady?

107
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,310
Then it was thus you, the pirate Roronoa Zoro.

108
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,280
Do you want to take again this katana to me?

109
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,040
I…

110
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,020
I was made have like a idiot!

111
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,110
What?

112
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,120
What did you make him?

113
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,050
You never asked me for my name, if I am not mistaken.

114
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,160
I never lied you.

115
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,990
The villains of your kind who carry such a sword… I will not never forgive them!

116
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,250
Your Meitou, Wado Ichimonji, I you will confiscate it!

117
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,420
Always test.

118
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,600
Species of ill-mannered lout!
How can you fight against a Lady?

119
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,810
Remain apart from that, please!

120
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,190
It is a combat between Roronoa and me!

121
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,810
Leave us!

122
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,900
You heard it?
Leave in front!

123
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,210
It left.

124
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,070
He, Zoro. If you wound the Lady, you are a dead man!

125
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,140
Tashigi sergeant!

126
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,740
I will be able to never lose this katana, no matter what it arrives to me.

127
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,640
The Tashigi sergeant lost…

128
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,700
How the Tashigi Sergeant has it…

129
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,900
Hello. I must from go away.

130
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,240
Why not have killed me?

131
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,820
Is this because I am a woman?

132
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,610
Zoro, you of ace of the chance…
You are a boy.

133
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,450
Even if the force of a woman is lower than that of a man,

134
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,340
I find that humiliating that an adversary does not fight seriously against me!

135
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,680
I do not think that you include/understand at which point
I would have wished to be a man with my birth.

136
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,080
I do not declad my katana to play, me!

137
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,890
I do not even include/understand why you exist!

138
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,990
Listen well! This face…

139
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,740
resembled exactly that of my friend who died, a long time ago!

140
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,210
And moreover, you tell the same sweet talk!

141
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,660
Then stops imitating it, species of dirty copier!

142
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,240
What? Stop speaking to me like a child!

143
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,200
I always was like that!

144
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,520
I am unaware of which kind of girl was your friend,

145
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,150
but there it is rather me which should regret!

146
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,190
Why wouldn't it be it which copies me?

147
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,280
What did you say?

148
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,050
I manage to see the end of the street!

149
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,800
The port is in this direction!

150
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,050
He, which it is over there?

151
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,360
Te here…

152
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,450
Luffy with the Straw hat.

153
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,860
I already said it to you:if you do not manage to beat me, you will be able to never go to Grand Line.

154
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,860
Ah yes, I had forgotten it!

155
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,400
Do not play the imbeciles.

156
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,860
He, Luffy.

157
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,780
Sanji, leave in front.

158
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,810
I arrive afterwards.

159
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,020
Do not count too on top.

160
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,540
It will be your end.

161
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,840
Go ahead!

162
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,780
Fire!

163
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,170
Gunners, fire!

164
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,480
If nothing is done, they will succeed in running the Vogue-Merry!

165
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,650
You weigh the anchor?

166
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,510
Luffy and the others did not return yet!

167
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,920
But one must leave!

168
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,750
One cannot let our boat be made draw above!

169
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,580
Right in front!

170
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,870
One will make how for Luffy and the others?

171
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,580
It is necessary that they find a solution to join us!

172
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,300
Do not let them escape… Follow them!

173
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,340
Nami-San!!

174
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,880
Sanji-Kun!

175
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,040
Sanji!

176
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,590
Nami-San, I am of return!!

177
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,180
Where are Luffy and Zoro?

178
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,120
These deux-là is occupied saving their skin for the moment…

179
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,560
Sanji-Kun!

180
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,550
Behind you!

181
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,770
Shit! That will thus finish never!

182
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,630
I go to his rescue! Return to the port!

183
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,300
Impossible… The current is too much strong!

184
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,270
Good blood!!

185
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,140
Usopp!

186
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,130
Let make me!

187
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,210
Usopp, Sanji-Kun!

188
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,410
I will beat you to enter Grand Line,

189
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,840
because I am that which will become the Lord of the Pirates!

190
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,050
Stop always arising me the same sweet talk!

191
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,100
It is what that?

192
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,650
I ate the Fruit Moku Moku.

193
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,440
All my body can be transformed into smoke at will!

194
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,450
What arrives to you? It is already finished?

195
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,060
What?

196
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,350
He, I have a bad presentiment…

197
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,180
Thin…

198
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,260
Included/understood? You will be able to never enter Grand Line like that,

199
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,600
how I still said it presently to you!

200
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,980
Is your head fixed at 30 million Berrys?

201
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,710
It would be said that your chance left…

202
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,410
I would not say that to your place.

203
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,960
You are…

204
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,140
What does it occur?
Who it is? Who it is?

205
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,380
Does the government want your head, you know it?

206
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,800
The world still awaits our answer.

207
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,320
It was what?

208
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,740
What did it occur?

209
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,390
Luffy!

210
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,720
Luffy!!

211
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:30,990
Nami!

212
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,090
We must do something if not it and the boat will be made carry by the current.

213
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,530
Ouais!!

214
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,430
Not…

215
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,610
Wait…

216
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,080
It will not do it…

217
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,700
The guy!

218
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,320
This kid… From where can it come?

219
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,750
22 years ago exactly, Gold Roger was carried out.

220
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,700
And today, a kid appears,
he survives the lightning and his execution.

221
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,610
I will be… that which will become the Lord of the Pirates!!

222
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,160
Mets veils!

223
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,550
It is the way which you chose…

224
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,440
Why? Why to have helped this boy,

225
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,230
Dragon?

226
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,150
Why annoy a man who wishes only to take the sea?

227
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,730
Find to me a boat.
I go to his continuation…

228
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
I will go to Grand Line.

229
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,820
But, Colonel…

230
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,030
This island is under your jurisdiction!
If nobody controls, how to say…

231
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,930
You do not have to give me orders!

232
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,170
Me also, I come!

233
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,650
Tashigi sergeant!

234
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,670
I cannot forgive what Roronoa Zoro did to me!

235
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,800
I will capture it my own hands!!

236
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,900
Incredible, how such a storm
did it can occur?

237
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,440
It is perhaps a sign of the destiny so that
one can flee of this island.

238
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,120
Where does one go now?

239
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,040
In Large Line!

240
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,540
Large Line?

241
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,330
Yes, here is the occasion…

242
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,560
This elastic snotty-nosed kid goes over there,
isn't this?

243
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,420
Line much I missed Grand!

244
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,050
It would be said that the boat will fly away!

245
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,930
Look at this light!

246
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,580
That of the headlight of the island?

247
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,890
This light indicates the site of
the entry of Large Line!

248
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,360
If the light is followed, one arrives at Grand Line?

249
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,500
Then…

250
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,420
But one goes there during a storm like that one?

251
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,910
Well.

252
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,180
To celebrate this new adventure,
I propose to celebrate that!

253
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,090
Ouais…

254
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,170
Yes! No the problem!

255
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:56,980
Let us celebrate!

256
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,060
I want to find where Al Blue hides!

257
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,880
Me to be the Lord of the Pirates!

258
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,360
I want to become the best sword-man of the world!

259
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,730
Me, I want to draw a chart of the world!

260
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,700
I want…

261
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,200
I want to become a honest warrior of the seas!

262
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,860
It LEFT FOR LARGE LINE!

263
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,360
OUAIS!!

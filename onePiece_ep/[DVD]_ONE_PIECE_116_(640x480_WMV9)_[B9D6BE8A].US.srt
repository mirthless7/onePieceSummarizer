1
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,010
The transformation into Nami!

2
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,010
Bon Clay strikes with the Kenpo Ballet

3
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,060
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,200
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,430
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,500
With the variation of the battle, the South-eastern door,

7
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,610
Usopp and Chopper started their combat against the human mole, Miss Merry Christmas…

8
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,850
… and the beater N°4, Mr.4.

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,920
Usopp and Chopper, tired, in extreme cases of their power, finally left victorious.

10
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,080
During this time, Sanji and Mr.2, Good Clay
began their duel.

11
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,260
Continuing to use the capacities of the fruit Basket Basket, Mr.2, Good Clay…

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
… became a serious threat for Sanji!

13
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,400
M- Nice!

14
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,970
What of the mouth, isn't this?

15
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,900
You do not have even any more the force to be raised!

16
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,090
Do not believe that I will rest here and take that calmly!

17
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,860
It does not matter that you resemble Nami-San,

18
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,150
you are always the same idiot inside!

19
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,460
Monster of shit!

20
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,990
Do not believe yourself if…

21
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,650
You!

22
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,920
Shit… it is too nice…!

23
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,740
Ah, it makes so hot in this country…

24
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,710
It would be preferable that I remove this clothing…

25
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,670
I can help you?!

26
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,400
My eyes!

27
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,150
Poor idiot!

28
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,580
Your hard words are only stupid charades!

29
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,270
Salt dumb…

30
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,000
Y' in has to play enough…!

31
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,780
You go morfler!

32
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,080
Ah! Do not strike me!

33
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,010
It is necessary that I begin again my will mascara!

34
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,880
I played well with you.

35
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,550
But I must go really there.

36
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,940
We have order to kill Princess Vivi, above all.

37
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,090
Thus I will finish some quickly if that does not annoy you!

38
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
Tournicotis. Tournicotons!

39
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,140
I adore to turn!

40
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,340
What do you have says!?

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,600
To explode the palate!?

42
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,620
Yes, we received order to explode the palate.

43
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,050
We will destroy the palate!

44
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,470
It is not possible… They are serious?

45
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,000
Will they really destroy this palate which crossed the ages during 4.000 years?

46
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,130
Why?

47
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,120
In this state…

48
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,080
… it is hard to find the words.

49
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,230
They is good. I include/understand.

50
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,210
You had of another choice only to face the rebellious army.

51
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,980
You did an admirable work of maintenance of peace with the rebellion during two years without Igaram.

52
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,920
But, I am certain to be right.

53
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,300
These people whom I met will save Arabasta.

54
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,000
They are friendly truths.

55
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,160
The guy, leave in front!

56
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,990
All will go well for me!

57
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,220
You ensure that it arrives over there without risk!

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,620
Bring back Vivi at it!
Made blunder!

59
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,680
Listen, Vivi.

60
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,090
It will deal with Crocodile.

61
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,020
Time that the rebellious army manages to attack,

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,180
time for this country is counted.

63
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,050
If the royal army and the army rebel meet, it will be the end of this country.

64
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,420
And if you are the only one who can stop them…

65
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,750
… then you must remain in life, it does not matter the price to be paid.

66
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,000
Henceforth, no matter what it arrives to us…

67
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,490
… that does not have any more importance!

68
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,670
They wanted to let me have their lives…

69
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,980
I hope that they are well…

70
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,970
Vivi-Sama…

71
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,150
During the two years when I did not see you, you matured well.

72
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,330
When we see finally the end of this conflict,

73
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,470
I will want to organize a large banquet in the honor of these pirates.

74
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,000
Chaka…

75
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,470
Give me to eat.

76
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,180
Once I will have exploded Crocodile, you will nourish me until I die about it!

77
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,870
Yes, I believe in him.

78
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,990
As long as Luffy-San will remain in life, it will be likely to beat Crocodile!

79
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,370
Chaka-Sama!

80
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,310
What is there?

81
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,510
Did you really give the order to destroy the palate!?

82
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,050
The soldiers started to gather the gunpowder!

83
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,950
There must be an error!

84
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,790
I am that which gave this order.

85
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,460
Vivi-Sama!

86
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,250
Please, set up all the gunpowder which you can.

87
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,400
To put an end to this useless confrontation,

88
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,140
and to save the lives of the people of Arabasta,

89
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,670
I will destroy this palate!

90
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,200
Hold good!

91
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,240
It is not so serious, Usopp!

92
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,490
Only tone femur is broken!

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,280
Your nose and your humérus as your clavicle are almost foutus also…

94
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,560
But your state is close to the threshold criticizes…

95
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,580
Your blood pressure resembles that of a zombie, but…

96
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,540
you do not have absolutely anything to fear!

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,940
Ah…

98
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,210
I feel so well now…

99
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,510
I can see a splendid field of flowers!

100
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,910
E- Do you see the paradise!?

101
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,710
You can see the paradise!?

102
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,510
It does not matter the large pirate who you could be,

103
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,880
you will always meet the end one day.

104
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,230
Do not die, Usopp…

105
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,730
Please, I do not want that you die!

106
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,220
Good-bye.

107
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,670
Chopper, I bequeath you my large treasure.

108
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,340
Fifteen gold and silver coins.

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Become a large doctor.

110
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,170
Usopp!!

111
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,440
Open the eyes! Open them!

112
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,880
There is still something which I must say to you!

113
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,120
Manjuu.

114
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,820
Manjuu = Japanese traditional In-case lined paste of bean sweetened

115
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,820
This manjuu that you were going to eat…

116
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,700
I had hidden it.

117
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,140
If I had known that you were going to die, I would have given you half of it.

118
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,710
My heart is so surface and small…

119
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,570
Manjuu.

120
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,810
Manjuu…

121
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,440
Manjuu…

122
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,160
Shit, this idiot!

123
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,960
Where devil did it go!?

124
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,500
I however said to him to close it and to hide!

125
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,470
She is really breakage-testicles!

126
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,950
What a stupid woman!

127
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,530
It is the end. I cannot run any more.

128
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,090
I will have to beat me…

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,190
Or not.

130
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,980
It is time to finish some.

131
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,110
If impatient.

132
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,560
Zoro!

133
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,240
The column crumbles all alone!

134
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,460
All alone?

135
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,910
Not.

136
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,490
I heard the sound of a blade splitting the air.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,900
You me genes.

138
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,840
You, isn't this sliced it?

139
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,000
With this arm.

140
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,650
It is a quite strange body which you have there.

141
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,900
Indeed.

142
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
I ate the fruit Supa Supa, and since my body is a blade.

143
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,300
It, isn't this was you?

144
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,080
The fencer who massacred our 100 employees with Whiskey Peak.

145
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,600
And a few years ago in East Blue, Baroque Works sent Mr.7 to give…

146
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,060
… an invitation with a certain hunter of pirates but it seems that he was made kill.

147
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,760
It was still you.

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
He, now I remember some.

149
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,740
It was your fault, you had not accepted my conditions.

150
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,650
I remember of what I had said to your man:

151
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,000
“If I become the Boss, I unite with you.”

152
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,750
That it is funny.

153
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,770
Instead of accepting my conditions, it tried to kill me.

154
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,450
Thus I did what I had to do.

155
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,730
You want to try to recruit me too?

156
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,330
I would not like even any more of the armchair now that I know at which point your Boss is stupid.

157
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,840
You want to play the malignant ones with me?

158
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,010
Poor epeist of so small and useless crew of pirates.

159
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,800
And you, you looked at yourself well?

160
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,040
A puppet without brain deluded by this “ideal nation”?

161
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,230
Unless you would not be empty inside…

162
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,820
an empty metal carcass!

163
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,490
Miss Doubles Finger.

164
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,930
“I will kill this type”, it is that?

165
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,500
Go ahead.

166
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,830
I will see the girl.

167
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,490
He, Nami!

168
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,630
She left…

169
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,950
Tournicotis. Tournicotons!

170
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,240
And to finish you, my 320.000 turns…

171
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,180
Large Whip!

172
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,360
Hold, hold…

173
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,660
I have just seen his weak point.

174
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,990
I saw the fault…

175
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,050
… of its fruit Basket Basket.

176
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,470
I saw the fault of his fruit Mane Basket.

177
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,450
I was right thus.

178
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,670
Considering the fault?

179
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,970
It is not true!?

180
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,250
How did you can find a weak point with my capacities!?

181
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,580
You cannot use your Kenpo Ballet when you take the appearance of Nami-San.

182
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,560
I cannot however still not overcome it.

183
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,370
But at the moment when you are on the point of attacking me, you must take again your true appearance.

184
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,980
By touching your cheek with your left hand, not true?

185
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:11,880
Eh?

186
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,010
What did you say?

187
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,520
I do not hear you any more!

188
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,430
He.

189
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,630
I put in the thousand, one would say.

190
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,550
And then!?

191
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,210
You are right, you are right.

192
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,670
Without my sublime body, carved day after day by strict exercises,

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,700
I cannot control the techniques of the Kenpo Ballet!

194
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,830
And then?

195
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,950
You are already at the end of the roller!

196
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,010
And moreover, wait to see that!

197
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,630
Ballet Kenpo Preceded!

198
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,670
And I think that you should know that:

199
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,910
that on your left is a female…

200
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,300
… and that on your line is a male.

201
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,100
I of insane!

202
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,300
How you want, species of uncultivated!

203
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,580
How will you puff out that?

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,370
What…!

205
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,950
It did that of only one kick!?

206
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,760
You were right!

207
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,200
You were right to avoid it!

208
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,400
At the end of this long flexible neck, there is a fatal steel nozzle!

209
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,350
There is not the least crack around the hole!

210
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,440
By condensing all my power in only one point,

211
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,860
I am able to avoid making useless destruction.

212
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,510
One of my kicks is as terrifying as a rifle shot.

213
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,410
Except that the gauge is a little larger!

214
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,770
I will make you full with holes!

215
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,820
It is useless!

216
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,510
Shit!

217
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,250
It has a too long lengthening-piece…!

218
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,790
The victory is with me!

219
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Jump, change.

220
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,300
I will jump!

221
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,490
But, with its lengthening-piece, that will take more time to him to go back in guard.

222
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,650
If I avoid the first blow, I should be able to take it speed.

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,890
Now die!

224
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,500
Too bad!

225
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,720
What do you say that?

226
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,000
He!

227
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,950
You ace a trick on your left cheek.

228
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,610
Eh?

229
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,480
Really?

230
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,320
J- I go…

231
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,710
Incredible…

232
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,800
You are still conscious?

233
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,250
What is there?

234
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,440
If you took again the appearance of Nami-San,

235
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,580
I could not complete you.

236
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,600
Anything.

237
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,610
I cannot move any more.

238
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,800
What would I have to gain by avoiding the final blow?

239
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,660
You gained.

240
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,590
Kill to me.

241
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,810
My destiny was to die for the organization…

242
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,690
What do you wait?

243
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,180
Go ahead, completes me.

244
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,710
It was a beautiful combat.

245
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,970
Not need to say some more.

246
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,220
It is without any doubt a proof of friendship between rivals…

247
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,460
But I should not cry!

248
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,340
With more!

249
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,500
I take again the glasses of our “gunner”.

250
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,130
It… completed me…

251
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,370
It would be said that I still broke bones…

252
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,770
T-all the preparations are ready!

253
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,720
We await your orders to light the wicks.

254
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,580
This palate was impregnated 4.000 years of history of Arabasta.

255
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,420
I am so proud.

256
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,820
But if I destroy the palate,

257
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,540
people will stop fighting and will look at me!

258
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,310
I will be able to tell them the truth of my own mouth!

259
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,510
Light them, now!

260
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,420
Q- What is it!?

261
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,680
Does that go!?

262
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,120
… Sand…

263
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,730
They is very tedious…

264
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,670
You are rather bold, Miss Wednesday.

265
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,570
Ca will be soon my house, you know.

266
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,480
Crocodile!

267
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,760
Your majesty!

268
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,140
Father!

269
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,090
This palate is not so badly.

270
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,740
I have a superb sight of all these small shits in bottom.

271
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,260
O- Where is Luffy-San?

272
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,670
Hein?

273
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,600
You want to say Straw hat?

274
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,770
This species of beginner…

275
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,510
He died.

1
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:34,520
Battle of Titans!

2
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:34,520
The Giants Dorry and Brogy

3
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,700
Eh well?

4
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,740
I am sorry.

5
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,080
You could repeat?

6
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,090
I asked to you whether you have gnôle.

7
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
We must have some a little…

8
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,010
Oh! You have some?

9
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,260
We drank some very little lately, one especially uses it for the kitchen.

10
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,770
But if you want some, you can all take!

11
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,780
A dino…

12
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,610
A dinosaur.

13
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,020
I AM the MOST POWERFUL WARRIOR Of ELBAF!

14
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,590
BROGY!

15
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,050
Now, I have what to eat.

16
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,430
You regard as my guests.

17
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,890
He…

18
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,960
Make the dead…

19
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,530
no matter what it does.

20
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,320
But it is not a bear.

21
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,950
Be sure for you that will function?

22
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,340
What a seen splendid!

23
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,380
It is the ideal place to eat my snack.

24
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,980
But be unconscious for you my word?

25
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,200
Then y' has really volcanos by here.

26
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,190
And it there capable enormous cracks over there!

27
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,980
They is dangerous!

28
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,650
Go down from there immediately!

29
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,990
Even if there with the flexible air, that remains always a dinosaur!

30
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
They is good, worries you!

31
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,530
I want to see the large cracks over there!

32
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,530
It is surely a strange place!

33
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,460
The place, one of fout!
Then go down from there!

34
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,170
He, sorry to disturb you,

35
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,460
but could you lead me over there?

36
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,530
He, even if you do not include/understand a word of what I say,

37
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,290
go, please takes along me.

38
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,600
Over there! At this place!

39
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,800
Not there…

40
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,310
Over there!

41
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,050
DO NOT MAKE CA!

42
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,450
Oh, sorry… I was right…

43
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,800
It IS Of HELL!

44
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,550
Luffy-San! They is dangerous!

45
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,430
Now, go down from there immediately!

46
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,430
He, these dinos is larger!

47
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,680
I bet that I will see better up there!

48
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,520
About what you do speak?

49
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,060
As I thought it.

50
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,530
I can still better see the cracks from here.

51
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,200
Pay attention!

52
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,470
Vivi! You should test! It is owl!

53
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,880
The sight is much better here!

54
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,650
It was made puff out very believed!

55
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,900
Where am I?

56
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,120
I observed you!

57
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,490
You played with the long necks in full jungle.

58
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,500
What a sharp small human!

59
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,830
Here well a long time that I had not had any more of guest.

60
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,540
Be gigantic for you!

61
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,620
Be human for you?

62
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,630
You requests if I am human?

63
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,760
I am the most powerful warrior of Elbaf, Dorry!

64
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,600
It is a Giant.

65
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,520
I never saw some…

66
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,890
Only heard stories which spoke about it…

67
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,360
I am Luffy.

68
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,440
A pirate!

69
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,360
A pirate? It is brilliant!

70
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,450
Karu, awakes!

71
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,410
Let us leave from here before it is too late!

72
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,410
Do Ah, you see these people over there?
It is Vivi and Karu.

73
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,240
Said “hello” the guy!

74
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,370
Luffy-San, why do you have says that?

75
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,250
He the guy, let to me show you where I live.

76
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,610
It is appetizing!

77
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,990
For how long will one have to do it dead?

78
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,830
I knew it. This trick does not function on the Giants.

79
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,300
It was surely my imagination.

80
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,600
Good blood, why you shouted ace?

81
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,020
It left all alone.

82
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,770
You ace considering all these skeletons over there?

83
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,350
I know, I know. But…

84
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,810
Early or late, he will eat us too.

85
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,270
Do not say that!

86
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,020
But…

87
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,070
One cannot wait until he eats us!

88
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,580
Mm, mm, succulent, this meat of dinosaur!

89
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,880
Roast in the flames of fire and lends to being absorbed!

90
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,300
Mm, mm, succulent, this meat of dinosaur!

91
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,180
Mm, mm, succulent, this meat of dinosaur!

92
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,970
Succulent…

93
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,180
this meat of dinosaur!

94
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,790
One has finally…

95
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,160
succeeded in escaping to us…

96
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,870
At least one will not finish in the stomach of the Giant.

97
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,180
But…

98
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,300
To be digested by a Tiger with the Teeth of Saber, it is not better either!

99
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,640
Finally, all that one does is to change stomach.

100
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,310
It does not matter what one does, our destiny is sealed.

101
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,190
One made our better,
one must just accept our fate.

102
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,360
He, the guy, you are finally awaked.

103
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,820
The meat is ready.

104
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,990
Let us take your gnôle and eat!

105
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,880
Well, let us eat!

106
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,380
The meat of dinosaur is very good!

107
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,550
I lost the appetite.

108
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,760
You do not obstruct! Eat!

109
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,140
One does not want to eat some…

110
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,140
One does not want to eat some…

111
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,100
But they is however good, the meat of dinosaur!

112
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,400
First of all, it lets to us eat the meat of dinosaur,

113
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,190
what returns more dodus to us…

114
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,150
And then he will eat us.

115
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,410
Yes, it is what make the Giants.

116
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,330
One is too young…

117
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,120
Perhaps that he prefers the tender meat.

118
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,540
Oh which taste…

119
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,120
They is really good.

120
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,800
Perhaps that if we are able to deprive to us of food until the Log reloads,

121
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,130
we will be able to remain in life.

122
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,760
But how long is it necessary so that the Log is reloaded?

123
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,680
The meat feels so good, that I will not be able to control myself any more very a long time.

124
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,940
Brogy-San, do I can ask you a small question?

125
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,270
Go ahead small, I listen to you.

126
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,190
How long is it necessary so that the Log is reloaded on this island?

127
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,070
One year.

128
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,870
Not…

129
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,250
It is impossible, one will not be able to be deprived of food during one year…

130
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,210
I… will be unable to control me.

131
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,460
Then you put at ease!

132
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,020
They is super good, Giant-Ossan!

133
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,520
This small bento of pirate was not bad either.

134
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,860
With share which it was a little small!

135
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,610
Of course!

136
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,700
It was a special menu prepared by my cook!

137
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,820
If you had said that it was dégueux, I would have you boot the buttocks.

138
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,700
Boot my buttocks?

139
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,960
What a joker, this p' tit man!

140
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,420
One would say of the old pals together.

141
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,460
With do the fact, Ossan, why you only live here?

142
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,130
You ace not of village?

143
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,010
Ouais, I have a village.

144
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,180
Elbaf, the village of the warriors.

145
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,470
Some share on Large Line…

146
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,230
But there are laws in my village.

147
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,020
Laws?

148
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,100
For example,

149
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,400
to regulate a conflict, the opponents must leave the village

150
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,650
and to accept the judgment of our Elbaf God.

151
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,320
Elbaf always grants its divine protection to the Juste.

152
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
And only one warrior out of alive spring.

153
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,700
Your Elbaf God?

154
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,870
Eh well, I began a quarrel.

155
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,290
And for this day, this island has been used to us as arena to my adversary and me,

156
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,380
until the right terrace the other.

157
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,130
But that made 100 years and y' still does not have a winner!

158
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,220
You have fought for 100 years?

159
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,560
Be astonished to you? Y' does not have what,

160
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,890
one saw 3 times longer than you, the small men.

161
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Even if you live 3 times longer,

162
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,650
a 100 year old combat,
that does not have any more any direction!

163
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,070
Why do you continue to beat you?

164
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,820
You could die about it.

165
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,370
With that, I will beat Zoro.

166
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,750
The winner of this challenge is that which will bring back the most meat,

167
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,340
and it will be me!

168
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,760
That which will bring back the most tons of meat will gain.

169
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,260
I will gain!

170
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,870
Zoro?

171
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,810
Sanji?

172
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,850
I AI GAIN!                             I AI GAIN!

173
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,220
You LOST ACE!

174
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,220
You LOST ACE!

175
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,090
Look at!

176
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,370
Mine is larger!

177
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,540
What?

178
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,210
The challenge was of knowing which would bring back the most tons of meat!

179
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,750
Apparently, I paid more, therefore I gained!

180
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,750
What counts it is how much one can draw some in kitchen.

181
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,340
With this heap of bone,

182
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,260
you can only draw 5 grams from meat!

183
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,100
This trick has nerves so much, that it is inedible!

184
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,350
I can nothing there, I had to face this poor small beast.

185
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,560
But the next one will be so large that it will nail you the nozzle.

186
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,610
Ah yes? Eh well mine will be so large

187
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,900
how it will not be the sorrow to compare!

188
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,620
Very well.

189
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,490
The next volcanic eruption will be the signal of end.

190
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,710
One will have to bring back our preys to the Vogue-Merry with this signal.

191
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,370
Ouais. Ca suits me.

192
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,880
It is a SACREE eruption!

193
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,800
It is the hour to go there.

194
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,850
It is what that?

195
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,230
An volcanic eruption.

196
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,030
Its glance changed…

197
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,990
I am afflicted,

198
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,540
but I must leave.

199
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
Hein? To leave?

200
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,580
Ouais.

201
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,630
It has been the signal of our engagements for 100 years.

202
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,210
A combat?

203
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,760
Against which?

204
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,300
For which reason?

205
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,590
Reason?

206
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,390
I forgot it!

207
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,850
I remember more when one decided

208
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,480
that the volcanic eruption would be the signal of our engagements.

209
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,230
But…

210
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,070
Why have you hated yourselves at this point for 100 years?

211
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,740
Which is the reason initially?

212
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,070
Ca is enough.

213
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,160
Ca does not have anything to see.

214
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,540
Exactly.

215
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,790
It is a question of honor!

216
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,760
REASON?

217
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,310
A LONG TIME AGO THAT I It AI OUBLIEE!

218
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,120
What is there?

219
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,330
Incredible.

220
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,960
They are gigantic!

221
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,690
He. Out of my way, large lizard.

222
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,980
Let to me take care some.

223
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,460
Oh, Mr. 5.

224
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,010
You have a famous capacity.

225
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,630
To also quickly build a hiding-place in full jungle…

226
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,090
But as you know it, it is always our mission.

227
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,100
One made a point of specifying it.

228
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,310
There will be no more blunders.

229
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,480
Blunders?

230
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,560
Not, I do not believe.

231
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,230
You are quite simply the inefficient ones, Mr. 5, Miss Valentine.

232
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,160
It is useless to take this air.

233
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,030
Throw an eye with this research opinion.

234
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,080
I must really thank you

235
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,290
to have given the opportunity to me to come on this island.

236
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,670
The Blue Ogre Dorry and the Red Ogre Brogy of the Giant Pirate Warriors.

237
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,760
I heard legends on them.

238
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,220
Is this research opinion old one hundred years, not truth?

239
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,770
Yes, but they are always alive here, on this island.

240
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,600
<b>This time, they were worth 00,000,000 chacun.</b>

241
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,150
<b>A them two, that made aneo BT} 200,000,000.</b>

242
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,320
<b>s72} B {\ fs60} {\ fnCataneo BT} 200,000,000 of reward? </b>

243
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,780
But they are Giants!

244
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:41,620
A professional assassin uses the trick to achieve his misdeeds.

245
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,120
You will have only to follow my orders to the letter.

246
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,460
With a little ingeniousness,
one can cut down mountains.

1
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:13,240
HAWK EYES MIHAWK!
SWORDMAN ZORO FALLS INTO THE SEA!

2
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,340
What did you say?!

3
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,155
Nami ran off with the Going Merry?!

4
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,814
What exactly happened?

5
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,899
Everything happened so suddenly.

6
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,264
Everything happened so suddenly.

7
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:29,994
Everything happened so suddenly.

8
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,032
What's up, Nami-anekI?

9
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:37,554
Huh?

10
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:40,734
You've been staring at that
bounty list for a while now.

11
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,715
Oh, it's nothing!

12
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,113
That's our Nami-anekiI

13
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:45,218
That's our Nami-aneki!

14
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,981
You've chosen the most valued pirate!

15
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:49,336
But it'd be best not to target Arlong alone.

16
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,787
But it'd be best not to target Arlong alone.

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,185
Not only is he fierce but strong.

18
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:54,237
Not only is he fierce but strong.

19
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:57,626
There was a time when he remained quiet.

20
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:57,991
There was a time when he remained quiet.

21
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:58,877
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

22
00:02:58,877 --> 00:02:59,763
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

23
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,233
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

24
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:00,650
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

25
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:00,963
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

26
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:01,275
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

27
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:01,432
But, I've heard that he's been moving about lately.

28
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:02,422
The 20 million beli reward sure is tempting.

29
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:02,892
The 20 million beli reward sure is tempting.

30
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,133
The 20 million beli reward sure is tempting.

31
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:11,077
But he's too strong that even we
can easily get butchered by him.

32
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,153
Nami-aneki?

33
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:19,575
Excuse me, but I'd like to change a sec,
so could you two turn around?

34
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,442
W-Wait!

35
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:25,642
Can't I?

36
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:23,902
Here? Right now?

37
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:24,111
Here? Right now?

38
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,334
Please! By all means!

39
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,841
She's quite daring.

40
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:36,988
Just a little peek won't hurt, right?

41
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:37,718
Just a little peek won't hurt, right?

42
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,126
Just a little peek won't hurt, right?

43
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:40,318
YEAH!

44
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,828
W-What are you doing?

45
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:54,610
W-What are you doing?

46
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,226
''What?'' you ask?

47
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:56,643
''What?'' you ask?

48
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:57,843
Business, of course!

49
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:59,771
I'm a thief that steals from pirates.

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,648
So I'll be taking this ship.

51
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,056
I don't recall saying that I was one of them.

52
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:03,421
I don't recall saying that I was one of them.

53
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:03,734
I don't recall saying that I was one of them.

54
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:04,411
I don't recall saying that I was one of them.

55
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,246
I don't recall saying that I was one of them.

56
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:05,663
I don't recall saying that I was one of them.

57
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:06,236
I was merely cooperating.

58
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:06,758
I was merely cooperating.

59
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:11,658
Although it was a rather short relationship
with Luffy and the gang, I enjoyed it.

60
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,161
Tell them that for me.

61
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:16,246
If we're meant to be together, we shall meet again!

62
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:17,915
If we're meant to be together, we shall meet again!

63
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:20,000
Nami-aneki

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,834
Nami-aneki

65
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,948
Th..This is a problem!

66
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:31,418
We were asked to take care of the ship!

67
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,565
We were asked to take care of the ship!

68
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,868
We were asked to take care of the ship!

69
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:34,181
We were asked to take care of the ship!

70
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:34,598
We were asked to take care of the ship!

71
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:35,380
We were asked to take care of the ship!

72
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,484
We were asked to take care of the ship!

73
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,320
And that's how we lost the ship!

74
00:04:58,476 --> 00:04:59,102
Forgive us!

75
00:04:59,206 --> 00:04:59,936
Damn! She took advantage of us!

76
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:03,325
Damn! She took advantage of us!

77
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,619
That ship was given by Kaya!

78
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,704
Hold up! I can see it!

79
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,112
It's the Going Merry!

80
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:11,249
Where's your ship?

81
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:13,126
We still have it, but...

82
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,368
Zoro, Usopp, leave right away!

83
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,193
Fetch Nami using their ship.

84
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:17,922
Never mind. Let it go.

85
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:18,392
Never mind. Let it go.

86
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:19,851
Never mind. Let it go.

87
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:22,302
There's no need to chase that woman.

88
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:25,691
I can't be without her as my navigator!

89
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,326
Fine!

90
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,151
What a pain-in-the-ass captain...

91
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,184
Hey Usopp, let's go!

92
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,953
Zoro-aniki, the ship's ready!

93
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:49,517
Luffy, what about you?

94
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:53,792
I haven't fully repaid this restaurant
yet, so I can't go.

95
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,095
Do be careful.

96
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,754
Things here are abnormal.

97
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:59,370
Yeah. I know

98
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:01,977
W-What? What's going on?

99
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:03,437
W-What? What's going on?

100
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:03,906
The ship's been split in two!

101
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:04,219
The ship's been split in two!

102
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:04,584
The ship's been split in two!

103
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:05,209
The ship's been split in two!

104
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:05,626
The ship's been split in two!

105
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:06,044
The ship's been split in two!

106
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,494
Look! Over there!

107
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,371
It's him!

108
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,765
Don Krieg! It's that man!!!

109
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:19,338
The man who destroyed our fleet!

110
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,433
The man who destroyed our fleet!

111
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,163
The man who destroyed our fleet!

112
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:21,841
The man who destroyed our fleet!

113
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:27,367
That man is...

114
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:37,950
That man is...

115
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,965
That scum...

116
00:06:43,216 --> 00:06:44,050
He's come this far to kill us!

117
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,363
He's come this far to kill us!

118
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,041
He's come this far to kill us!

119
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,813
He's come this far to kill us!

120
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,212
We're doomed!

121
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,506
Zoro, who the heck is he?

122
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:52,600
Zoro, who the heck is he?

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,999
The man I've been searching for,

124
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:55,781
The man I've been searching for,

125
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:58,127
Hawk Eyes Mihawk.

126
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,942
Hawk Eyes Mihawk?

127
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,066
The strongest swordsman in the world!

128
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:18,303
That's the guy who instantly sank Krieg's fleet of 50
ships, which should've withstood the Grand Line?

129
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:22,005
And he Just destroyed another one of Krieg's ship!

130
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,446
But, he looks no different from
any other ordinary person.

131
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:28,835
And he doesn't seem to be armed
with anything special.

132
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:31,702
His weapon's on his back.

133
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:31,911
His weapon's on his back.

134
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,683
No way, you can't mean?!

135
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,646
He destroyed that huge ship with that sword?!

136
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,295
He's the great swordsman, Hawk Eyes.

137
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,077
A swordsman, above all of the world's swordsmen.

138
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,101
A swordsman, above all of the world's swordsmen.

139
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:53,808
I never thought I'd be abIe to meet him so soon.

140
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,319
Finally, the destined time has come.

141
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:55,684
Finally, the destined time has come.

142
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,101
Finally, the destined time has come.

143
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:56,414
Finally, the destined time has come.

144
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:56,884
Finally, the destined time has come.

145
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:57,770
Finally, the destined time has come.

146
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,846
Bastard!

147
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,974
Why did you attack us?

148
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,841
To kill time.

149
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,230
Bullshit!

150
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:21,700
W-What?!

151
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,681
I'm sure I was right on target!

152
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,037
It deviated.

153
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:29,051
He redirected it with the tip of his sword.

154
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,189
That's ridiculous!

155
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,577
Hey! Who the hell are you?

156
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,592
Swords, three of 'em! Could it be..?

157
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:42,711
I've never seen such graceful skill.

158
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,995
A sword with power alone is not powerful.

159
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,645
So this ship was cut apart with that sword, too?

160
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:50,635
Of course.

161
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:54,128
It's clear now. You're the strongest!

162
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,446
I've been sailing the seas to face you.

163
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,157
What's your mission?

164
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:03,408
To be the best!

165
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:05,859
Fool.

166
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,667
You've got time to spare, don't you?
Let's duel, shall we?

167
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,660
This guy is...

168
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:19,153
Zoro! The ''Three Swords'' Roronoa Zoro!

169
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,144
What?!

170
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:22,594
Pirate hunter, eh?

171
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:24,367
That guy?

172
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:28,955
Hey!

173
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:30,206
Things are getting worse, Luffy!

174
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,656
Going Merry is about to be gone from our sights!

175
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,220
Hey Luffy!

176
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:35,576
Duel?

177
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,121
Such a pitiful weakling.

178
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:45,847
If you really were a fine swordsman,

179
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:50,482
You should've been able to Judge the difference
in strengths without drawing your sword.

180
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,302
Challenging me...

181
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,786
Are you that brave? Or simply reckless?

182
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,767
This is for my own ambition!

183
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,658
And for a promise to my fallen friend

184
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:11,028
The world's greatest swordsman Hawk
Eyes Mihawk vs Pirate Hunter Zoro.

185
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:13,583
What kind of fight will it turn out to be?

186
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,024
No one can win against Aniki!

187
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:19,787
Aniki's the best!

188
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:27,086
Hey now, what's the meaning of this?

189
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:32,404
I'm unlike those idiots who use
their all to hunt rabbits.

190
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:35,271
Though you're famous enough
to be called a swordsman,

191
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:41,006
this is the weakest of the four oceans, East Blue.

192
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:45,229
Unfortunately, I'm carrying nothing smaller than this.

193
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:48,670
Quit mocking me!

194
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,277
Just don't regret it when you die!

195
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:54,561
You're but someone who's yet
to experience the real world.

196
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,487
DEMON CUT!

197
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,391
Wh..what?!

198
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:09,680
Zoro!

199
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,591
Aniki's demon technique was broken!

200
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:17,449
But, that has always worked 100% of the time!!

201
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:18,700
What in the world happened?!

202
00:11:20,577 --> 00:11:21,411
I can't move!

203
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,184
What just happened?

204
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:24,852
No one could avoid this technique
before, but just with his toy, he...

205
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,667
No one could avoid this technique
before, but just with his toy, he...

206
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,326
Is this really happening?

207
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,967
Is a strength like his really this far away?

208
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,399
That can't be!

209
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,052
It can't be this far away!

210
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,734
The world shouldn't be this far off!!

211
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:51,702
This can't be happening, Aniki!

212
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,318
Please fight seriously!

213
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:55,038
Aniki!!!

214
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:56,967
It can't possibly be this far away!

215
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:05,357
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

216
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:12,395
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

217
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,984
Such unrestrained skill.

218
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:39,297
Just with that thing, he's taking
on all of Zoro's three swords!

219
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:42,269
That's a monster superior to monsters!

220
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,592
I... I didn't come all this way to
lose against this toy-like thing!

221
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,392
Zoro!

222
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:10,161
You're lucky, Zoro... because you're a boy.

223
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:14,019
I want to be the world's best too!

224
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,929
If only I was... If only I was born as a boy.

225
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:22,830
After defeating me, don't you dare
say such demeaning things!

226
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,655
That's too shameless!

227
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,262
You're my ultimate goal!

228
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:28,262
Zoro...?

229
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:30,963
Promise me.

230
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:35,551
That someday, either you or I will become
the greatest swordsman in the world!

231
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:37,250
Promise me!

232
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,376
Promise me!

233
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,409
It's a promise!

234
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:39,566
It's a promise!

235
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:45,926
To become the greatest in the world...

236
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,230
To become the greatest in the world...

237
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:01,202
I... have to become strong, for her sake too.

238
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,174
My strength will even reach the heavens!

239
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:07,406
I'm going to become the strongest in the world!

240
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:11,108
We promised... I will...

241
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:23,464
If I could just defeat this man...

242
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,716
What's your mission?

243
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,521
Why do you seek the ultimate power, you weakling?

244
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:43,452
Aniki's a weakling you say? You damn bastard!

245
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:46,091
I'll teach you a thing or two!

246
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,785
Stop! Yosaku! Johnny!

247
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,062
Don't interfere!

248
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,835
Just hang on!

249
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:54,745
Luffy...?

250
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,793
I can't afford to lose!

251
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:16,525
TIGER...

252
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:16,590
TIGER...

253
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:19,249
That's great! The world's greatest swordsman, eh?

254
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:23,002
As the Pirate King's Companion, if you're
not at least that, I'd be in a dilemma.

255
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,567
HUNTING PREY!

256
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:47,715
Do you wish to have this go through your heart?

257
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:49,370
Why don't you step back?

258
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:51,103
I don't know.

259
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,971
I'm not sure why myself.

260
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:56,786
But if I were to take even one step back,

261
00:15:57,151 --> 00:16:01,113
I believe that all those important oaths, promises,
and many other deals 'til now,

262
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:06,640
will all go to waste and I'll never be able
to return before you, ever again.

263
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,977
Yes, and that's called ''losing''.

264
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,417
That's why I can't step back.

265
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,607
Even if it means death?

266
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,840
Death may be better!

267
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,916
What strong will!

268
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,470
Preferring death over defeat.

269
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,840
Kid, announce your name!

270
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:36,357
Roronoa Zoro!

271
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:38,286
I'll remember that!

272
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:41,675
It's been a while since I've seen
such strong will. As a reward,

273
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,367
A gesture to a fellow swordsman,
I will wield this ''Black Sword'',

274
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,400
The most powerful sword in
the world, to end your life.

275
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,216
I appreciate your offer.

276
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:53,875
It's out!

277
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,804
The sword that cut the ship!

278
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:58,827
This is my last chance.

279
00:16:59,505 --> 00:16:59,870
World's number one... or death?

280
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,903
World's number one... or death?

281
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:07,899
That's enough, Aniki!

282
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:09,046
Please stop!

283
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:09,880
THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE!

284
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,506
THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE!

285
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:10,923
THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE!

286
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:15,824
THREE THOUSAND REALMS!

287
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:16,501
THREE THOUSAND REALMS!

288
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:26,616
I lost.

289
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:31,308
Losing wasn't something I'd ever imagine possible.

290
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,948
So this is what it is to possess the
greatest power in the world?

291
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:41,943
What now?

292
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,697
Attacking from behind is a shameless
act among swordsmen.

293
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:47,574
Well said.

294
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:56,750
ZORO!!!

295
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:01,599
Don't rush your death, young lad.

296
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,039
Zoro!!

297
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,281
Aniki!

298
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,348
Why?

299
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:17,917
When I decided to become the greatest swordsman
in the world, I've already discarded my life.

300
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:18,647
When I decided to become the greatest swordsman
in the world, I,'ve already discarded my life.

301
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,315
When I decided to become the greatest swordsman
in the world, I've already discarded my life.

302
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,600
That guy and his stupid ideas

303
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,225
That guy and his stupid ideas

304
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,154
His opponent was the true world's greatest.

305
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,031
The result was obvious!

306
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,377
Why didn't yougive up your ambitions,
realizing inevitable death?

307
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:31,889
It's simple!

308
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,558
To abandon your ambitions!

309
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,980
This is Grand Line's power?!

310
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,700
The world's power?

311
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:45,080
Even the Pirate Hunter Zoro didn't stand a chance!

312
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,824
Damn! Damn! DAMN IT!

313
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:50,762
Aniki!

314
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:57,957
What the hell is that?

315
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:03,275
That kid's got the ability of a devil fruit?

316
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:05,308
Bastard!

317
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,479
You're the young swordsman's comrade?

318
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,503
Thank you for watching over him.

319
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:21,470
Rest assure, that man's still alive.

320
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:25,432
Aniki! Aniki! Say something!

321
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:26,162
Zoro!

322
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:29,134
Zoro!!!

323
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,115
Hey, quickly get him on the ship!

324
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:31,272
Hey, quickly get him on the ship!

325
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,069
Here's some medicine! Apply it quickly!

326
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:37,524
It's still too early for you to die.

327
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,500
My name is Juraquille Mihawk!

328
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:44,358
Find your true self, true world, become stronger!

329
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:49,832
No matter how long it will take, I will
await you in my strongest form!

330
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,074
Surpass this sword!

331
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:55,254
Surpass me!

332
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,870
Roronoa Zoro!

333
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,780
Aniki! Aniki! Say something!

334
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:05,368
For Hawk Eyes Mihawk to declare such words...

335
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,226
Kid, what's your mission?

336
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:10,738
Pirate King!

337
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:15,587
That's a difficult path, harder than surpassing me.

338
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,193
Like I'd care, 'coz I'm gonna become one anyway!

339
00:20:19,862 --> 00:20:20,644
He's alive!

340
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,042
He just lost consciousness!

341
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:23,928
Aniki!

342
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:26,170
Aniki! Say something!

343
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:27,526
Zoro!

344
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:29,403
Aniki!

345
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:34,564
Luffy, can you hear me?

346
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:35,398
Yeah!

347
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:40,143
Sorry for worrying you.

348
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:48,901
If I don't become the greatest swordsman in
the world, you'd be in a dilemma now, right?

349
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,290
Aniki! Don't say anymore!

350
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,176
Aniki!

351
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:56,565
I will... I will never...

352
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,745
LOSE AGAIN!

353
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:10,798
Until I defeat him and become the greatest
swordsman, I'll never be defeated anymore!

354
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,884
Any problems with that,

355
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,533
Pirate King?

356
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,017
None!

357
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,467
Good team.

358
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,804
I hope we meet again.

359
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,723
Hold on there, Hawk Eyes!

360
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:33,738
Didn't you come for my head?

361
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:37,179
East Blue's greatest, Don Krieg's head?

362
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,681
That was my initial intention.

363
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:41,871
But I've had more than enough fun.

364
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm headed back to sleep.

365
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:49,066
It may have been enough fun for you,
but I haven't done my bit yet.

366
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:50,317
Don?!

367
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,184
Why is he intentionally stopping him?!

368
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:57,824
Die before you go!

369
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:01,422
A true fool.

370
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:10,650
He got away.

371
00:22:20,347 --> 00:22:21,233
Usopp!

372
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:22,484
Luffy!

373
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:23,840
Get going!

374
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,300
Take care of Nami.

375
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,916
Gotcha!

376
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,783
Me and Zoro will definitely get Nami back!

377
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:32,494
You Just make that cook one of us!

378
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:37,552
Then we'll make a party of five
and head to the Grand Line!

379
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,689
Yeah! Now go!

380
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,215
Men! With the interruption gone,
the real fight has just begun!

381
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,092
Let's get that ship!

382
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,031
YEAH!!!

383
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,202
Old man, if I get rid of 'em, can we call it even?

384
00:22:53,192 --> 00:22:54,548
Do as you please.

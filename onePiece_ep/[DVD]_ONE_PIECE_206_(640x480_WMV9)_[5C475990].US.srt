1
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:58,792
GOOD-BYE, FORTRESS!
The FINAL ESCAPE

2
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:09,561
That fears… That fears… That fears… That fears… That fears…

3
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,744
My unit of attack!

4
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,179
You caused us some problems,
Sheppard inspector.

5
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:20,478
Their boat is taken with the trap!
I let to you deal with the remainder!

6
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:24,677
If they are able to escape, I will hold you
for person in charge, Commander!

7
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,994
To hold me responsible?
No the concern…

8
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:33,220
To mention in your report/ratio the name of
those having put our operation in danger…

9
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,342
The crew of Mugiwara…

10
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:41,393
They proved to us that they were
such as the Admiral Akainu predicted it to me.

11
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,843
Thanks to them, in a certain direction,

12
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:49,475
We could justify the importance
Navarone fortress.

13
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:54,042
They penetrated an impregnable fortress.
To thwart all the traps undertaken against them…

14
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,679
and they are now always in mare.

15
00:02:56,679 --> 00:03:00,371
But it does not matter how much
these pirates can be gifted…

16
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,779
Indeed…

17
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,624
It is you Sergent? Ah well.

18
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:08,232
Remain in alarm until new order.

19
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:09,093
Yes, Me sior!

20
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,837
Remain in Alarm!

21
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,103
Yes, Me sior!

22
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:15,488
Commander! You will leave them
to escape without anything to make?

23
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,149
Please, remain quiet to observe the scene.

24
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:20,596
The échec et mat approaches.

25
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:21,594
But!

26
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,786
As I have just said it,
it is as if they were already caught.

27
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,632
The nine hour old trap crushes has
already be install,

28
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:27,352
See.

29
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:31,061
See? But to see what?
You venz to say for nine hours crushes…

30
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,089
If I say it to you…

31
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:35,156
it will not be any more one surprised.

32
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:42,505
Yosh! Full right throttle in front!

33
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:48,845
It would be said that our navigatrice is not interested
not too so that it occurs.

34
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,033
Nami-san! What doesn't go?

35
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,070
There is something behind us?

36
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:58,605
The fleet of Navarone follows us closely!

37
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,705
God thank you!
It would be said that they do not have any after us!

38
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,804
They dropped anchor?

39
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,487
They undoubtedly declare fixed price.

40
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:17,848
I wonder it…

41
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:22,457
They were crushed by our know-how!
They throw sponge!

42
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:27,985
Why don't they draw us above, at least?

43
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:30,336
Waits a little, you believe that they
manigancent something?

44
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,583
It is what worries me too!

45
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,735
When it worries, Nami-san…
It is so beautiful!

46
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,488
Commander… The hour came!

47
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:45,424
Yes, now follow the orders to the letter.

48
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:50,427
It was Drake? Why you do not have him
ordered to continue the continuations?!

49
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:53,517
Why the fleet did drop anchor?

50
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,789
It dropped anchor…

51
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,661
Because it is…
nine hours crushes.

52
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,063
Still this history of hour…

53
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:03,167
If they do not drop anchor…

54
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,271
They will be devoured by the hooks
sea of Navarone

55
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:08,605
Hooks of the sea of Navarone?

56
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:13,116
It is what this noise?

57
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:15,371
A river would be said.

58
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,576
A river on an island?

59
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,160
I did not see any of all the afternoon of it.

60
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,723
You see there better, there?

61
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,900
Is Nami-san, what it?

62
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,559
The rudder does not answer any more!

63
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:39,420
Y' has a trick not normal in this fortress,
it changes the conditions weather!

64
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,834
NOT!

65
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:44,487
Devoured by the hooks of the sea?

66
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:48,833
Even with the brilliant navigatrice
of Mugiwara on board,

67
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,396
Their boat will be unable
to escape this trap.

68
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:55,758
I never let my prey flee.

69
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,425
Then, here is reason.

70
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:04,838
Why do you have the air so satisfied?

71
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:06,710
The first time that one tried to escape,

72
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,329
I wondered why they used
a so rock port as a base.

73
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,134
It is not a little late for that?

74
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:14,971
What really astonished me…

75
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:17,355
It is the quantity of water little
deep in the port.

76
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:21,070
Normally, they open and close the lock
to control the water level inside.

77
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,900
They use the periods of low tide,

78
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,458
to make sure that nobody
fear of entering or of leaving.

79
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,358
It is an immense natural fortress!

80
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:31,857
What explains the intervals
regular times,

81
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,903
during which no boat
do not enter or does not leave the base.

82
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,843
Nami-san has a deductive power
so impressive!

83
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,563
Then, one does what now?

84
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,739
Yosh! Right in front of the lock!

85
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,391
ONE CANNOT, MORON!

86
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:46,770
Full right throttle in front!

87
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,105
You ACE LOST the HEAD OR WHAT?!

88
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:53,931
Luffy!

89
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,654
Q - What there this master key?!

90
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:58,271
One will fail oneself on the rocks!

91
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:02,774
THE BOAT WILL NOT HOLD!!

92
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,430
I knew it! There is a hole in the hull!

93
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:13,710
Oh, not!

94
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,172
It is a whore of hole!

95
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:16,601
There is board?

96
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:20,921
What?

97
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:22,562
Water was evacuated.

98
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:29,246
I drown!
I…

99
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:32,024
Oh, the boat is completely out of water.

100
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,168
Oi, that wants to say that…

101
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,860
That one can neither escape nor to even move.

102
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,735
Ca means that the enemy had very planned.

103
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:42,785
I drown…
I drown! I will drown!

104
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,956
The more that goes, the less that is arranged…

105
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:47,902
One does what?
One gives up the boat and one bars oneself?

106
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,283
Hmmm…

107
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,068
You want to still remake the same thing?

108
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:55,652
It is not the same thing!
When the tide will come, the boat will run!

109
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:56,828
With our gold?

110
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:58,099
I will not let that arrive!

111
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,795
Help me, please! I have the flagstone!

112
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:05,195
I have the stomach in the heels!

113
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,978
Wait a little…

114
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:09,483
The Dial Impact!

115
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,412
One can use it?

116
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:13,443
Water is rather low…

117
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:17,627
Not to have to worry for
boat until the next high tide.

118
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,995
But we cannot see
what the enemy is making.

119
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,082
Let us go eat small something!

120
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:25,401
How you can think of puffs out!
Look by over there!

121
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,017
Mugiwara Luffy!

122
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:44,440
As all its band!

123
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,639
“HYDRATES DE CARBONE
FORCES GIVE "

124
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,815
Mugiwara was made take by
the nine hour old trap crushes!

125
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:59,499
Even these guy cannot escape
with the hooks of the sea of Navarone!

126
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,213
What will arrive to them?

127
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,892
Eh well you see…

128
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:07,961
The captured pirates… are always carried out.

129
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,200
You should not leave in this state!

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,156
Dad, you are still sick!

131
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,797
Keep silent yourself! My tiredness started from itself!

132
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:25,125
This cretin would do better not
to destroy this splendid boat!

133
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,658
If it does it, I will botterai the bottom to him!

134
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:29,186
Tanuli-san!

135
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:37,628
Even in the navy, there is
a powerful fortress,

136
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:40,124
under the command of G-8 Division

137
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:41,551
I as well congratulate you to have fought.

138
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:44,666
You have admirable convictions,
but there, there is échec et mat.

139
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,308
Mugiwara kaizoku-da

140
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:50,437
You do not have any more any gleam
of espoire to flee.

141
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:58,400
I already anticipated all it of what you think.

142
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:01,568
Here, it is a good boy.

143
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,235
Under the authority of the command of Navarone.

144
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:07,647
All the band of Mugiwara will be
escorted, and to receive its sentence.

145
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,499
Give up the rebellion.

146
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:11,906
Luffy!

147
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:20,336
Mugiwara, You and Roronoa Zoro
be sought criminals,

148
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:22,581
Then we must lead you
at the General headquarter!

149
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:26,340
You have my word that the remainder of your band
will leave itself there healthy and except!

150
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,758
However, if you tents to flee,

151
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,243
I will be irritated!

152
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,368
Too much nice, that!

153
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,788
It is me which orders here.

154
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:38,190
You are only one inspector, I would be to you
admitting to observe without stumbling.

155
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,368
If I do not do anything, I will be nothing more
that a insect with the eyes of this old badger.

156
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:47,636
Moreover, I came here to prove
the uselessness of this fortress!

157
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:49,862
Excuse to me one moment.

158
00:10:53,266 --> 00:11:00,174
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

159
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:07,617
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

160
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:14,211
Here is the answer!

161
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,878
The Dial Impact.

162
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:20,428
I have to absorb several impacts
since we are escaped!

163
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:24,026
One should be able to leave the boat
rocks with that!

164
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,343
I see! One could use it for
we to leave from there and regain water!

165
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:30,369
But that is likely to take more than only one shooting…

166
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,870
And with this large hole in the hull,
one will run as soon as one is on water.

167
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,500
That would be well if one could again
to use the takoballoon to fly away.

168
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,254
Ouais, it is an good idea!

169
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:40,554
If one uses the Flame and Breath Dials,
isn't the octopus will reinflate itself?

170
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,551
Ouais! It is an excellent idea!

171
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,021
There is not the pieuve…

172
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:48,007
The pieuve…

173
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:48,696
Pieuve…

174
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,372
Pieuve…

175
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:50,006
Ouais…

176
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:50,495
Whore of octopus!

177
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:51,212
I have it…

178
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:51,902
He says that he has it…

179
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,005
He has it…

180
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:53,895
He has it…

181
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:54,910
Shit, it has it…

182
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,826
It has it…

183
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,683
You have it?

184
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,101
Ouais, just there!

185
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:06,039
LOOK AT!

186
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,368
HOW THAT SE MAKES THAT
HAVE you THIS TRICK, YOU?!

187
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:14,886
Eh well, you know, it has us
helped to go down from the sky.

188
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,425
Ouais, but good…

189
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,036
you did ace not found that a little dégeulasse?

190
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,148
Why that?

191
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,673
Let us leave to Octopus-san us
to help once more.

192
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,276
Of agreement, Mr. Length-Conk?

193
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:30,934
, That waits a little made one moment
that I did not see the DIal Flame…

194
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:33,495
It was funny then I have
played with in the kitchen!

195
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:35,887
It is Chaud!

196
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:40,167
Now, it remains more than to decide
who will engage the Dial Impact…

197
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,593
Why you look at me all like that?!

198
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,886
With which it is, this Dial Impact?

199
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:50,046
It is that of Usopp.

200
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,192
Isn't this, Mr. Length-Conk?

201
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,634
Good, like he says it so well,
it is necessary that it does it.

202
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,257
You are marvellous, Usopp!

203
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,761
I have respect for you so much!

204
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:59,773
How? We will help you!

205
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,133
All is regulated!

206
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:05,027
NOOON!!!

207
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,717
Sergeant! Prepare you to attack!

208
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,361
With your Orders!

209
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,338
Prepare you to draw

210
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:18,806
Avoided to draw! Loan!

211
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,539
Darling, you succeeded!

212
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,752
Work, it is the important one, but you
must also eat at the hours of the meals.

213
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:32,290
But I said to you that I do not like
broccolis, carrots and poivr…

214
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,287
Not! I want to say…
I have still work to finish.

215
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:39,145
To have taken with the Mugiwara trap and all
are crew also perfectly,

216
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:40,834
Isn't it enough for you?

217
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,710
All that you have to do
now, it is to capture them.

218
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,386
Indeed, but they surely go
to thwart our plans again.

219
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,382
You encircled the sea and the ground,
how could they escape?

220
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:53,430
Te you remember how they are
entered initially?

221
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,673
Hein?

222
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:57,615
It remains to them…
Sky!

223
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,270
All is profiled well!

224
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,915
Included/understood!

225
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:06,054
All is ready here! Now,
all depends on you, the guy!

226
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:12,312
I do not want! I cannot do it!
When I will make fire, that will burn with death!

227
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,218
Three!

228
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,167
Two!

229
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,151
One!

230
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,826
Dirtiness of Mugiwara! You want
me to humiliate, hein once more?!

231
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:29,004
I will crush you personally!

232
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,534
IMPACT!!!

233
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,724
How I thought it, they can fly!

234
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,130
Look at that!

235
00:14:57,193 --> 00:14:59,113
WHAT?!

236
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:05,749
Hummm… How to say…

237
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:08,059
One falls! One falls, one fall!

238
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:10,174
Robin, It has you!

239
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:12,091
CIEN FLOWERS!

240
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:21,460
One continues to fall!

241
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,114
Luffy! The Dial Flame!

242
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,314
YOSH!

243
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,596
INFLATE!!!

244
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,615
Usopp-sama once again!

245
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:38,648
I am not a vulgar piece of tofu!

246
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,097
If one leaves oneself there, I will treat you like
tofu of the first quality!

247
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:43,697
Of agreement?

248
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,946
Of agreement?! Better is worth to burst!

249
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:47,726
FLY!

250
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,543
Fly! Fly, Please!

251
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:51,847
I said to you to fly away, then flies!

252
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,741
Hold good, Octopus-san!

253
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:54,896
Look at! It is necessary to act!

254
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:56,916
The tide starts to come!

255
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:01,388
Ah, makes shit!
Usopp-sama will start again!

256
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,708
I sacrifice a shoulder and an arm again…

257
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,430
Quite known as!

258
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,820
It is perfect!

259
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,505
This pain… It is that of Going Merry!

260
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,466
Three!

261
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:13,113
Two!

262
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:13,821
One!

263
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:19,047
FLY!

264
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,162
IMPACT!!!!

265
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:30,209
A giant octopus!

266
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,245
You insane of me!
A giant octopus!

267
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,209
Ouah! That went!

268
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:37,321
A mongolfière, I see that we do not have
the intention to take account of my council.

269
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:40,455
Good, as soon as they reach
the zone of shooting, cut down them

270
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:41,381
Hein?

271
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:43,553
However, do not run up against the boat!

272
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,719
They must be taken alive!

273
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:50,231
It is difficult, like order.

274
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,579
To send to them a shooting of warning!

275
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,736
If they do not stop,
made fire in the balloon!

276
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,344
Included/understood!

277
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:05,617
Do not escape to you, Mugiwara.

278
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,575
Not yet…
The first shooting is only one warning.

279
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:36,416
You gave that…

280
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,150
Commander Sheppard.

281
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:06,174
This type…
It was barred.

282
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:08,712
Tanuki-san and its band… Flew away!

283
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,436
What I had said to you!

284
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:14,254
These guy came from the sky!

285
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,970
Too much cool!
That really resembles a hedgehog!

286
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,313
What a brilliant fortress!

287
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,742
OSSAN, WITH MORE!

288
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,238
GOOD-BYE, JESSICA-SWAN!

289
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:27,941
At this altitude,
can they draw us above?

290
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,574
This Fortress was built for
to defend against the marine attacks.

291
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,598
They do not have any artillery
able to draw also high.

292
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,254
Darling…

293
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:37,782
Then they ended up fleeing.

294
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:41,904
Ah, Sergeant! Is everyone well?

295
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,415
Yes, Commander,

296
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:46,467
The gun was destroyed,
but nobody was wounded.

297
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,909
Hum, it is well.

298
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,223
Commander!
Let continue them to us!

299
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:53,079
Give us the order to take them in hunting!

300
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:55,910
They already volitilized. Tombr is left.

301
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,024
But…

302
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,241
Lieutenant Drake,
you worked well!

303
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,820
Thank you with you.

304
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,361
Commander…

305
00:19:05,124 --> 00:19:08,262
What is there?
Commander Sheppard!

306
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:10,946
Commander! You claim that all
what arrives is of my fault?!

307
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,425
It is entirely of your fault!

308
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:15,905
I will contact the District
General and to make you transfer!

309
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,806
TO TRANSFER! TO TRANSFER! TO TRANSFER!

310
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:22,370
I insane that you are it
protected from the Admiral Akainu!

311
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,917
My report/ratio will put an end to the command
of this fortress which you have!

312
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:32,127
And be sure that all your subordinates
will be also thrown out of the Navy!

313
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,559
I swear it to you…

314
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,581
Species of IDIOT!!

315
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,803
Darling, are you sure of not
to want to continue them?

316
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:46,553
Mugiwara you escaped ace.

317
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:50,199
It is not as if I had invited them here.

318
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:54,010
Moreover… I already reached my
the most important objective.

319
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,274
Hein?

320
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:03,997
You noticed how all the personnel
does base work together?

321
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:13,418
I believe it of what you want to speak.

322
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:18,413
It does not matter, these pirates brought to
fortress that which it needed.

323
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:22,058
The General headquarter can think that
this fortress survived its uselessness.

324
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:24,758
They can say that it is oversize
or even pacifist if they like that.

325
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:27,152
The “pacifist” word is appropriate to me completely.

326
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:29,693
Most important, it is that us, soldiers,

327
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:33,072
and you, the civil personnel, let us can
to help and work together…

328
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:36,415
to protect this peace, you do not believe?

329
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:42,999
There are many Pirates like
Mugiwara outside.

330
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:47,057
The General headquarter will on the occasion to re-examine
at which point this fortress is important.

331
00:20:47,057 --> 00:20:51,918
I will not leave any of
you on the roadside.

332
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,620
You still like me?

333
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:56,228
idiot.

334
00:20:57,331 --> 00:21:00,404
But, this type, Crois you that it will write
a report/ratio at the General headquarter?

335
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:01,984
It my so put out
of me that I have it frapp…

336
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:03,517
I of insane!

337
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:05,668
I failed to strike it myself!

338
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,972
Eh well, Mugiwara,
where will you go, you and your troop?

339
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:18,343
There are people at the General headquarter which
narrowly were interested in you.

340
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,995
The road which is drawn up in front of you
will not be easier.

341
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:24,984
It is brilliant to fly!

342
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,160
Until where one will fly?

343
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,001
Who knows? Ask the octopus.

344
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,890
It is pleasant to depouvoir to profit
of a voyage by the airs.

345
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,395
But I do not want any more
to never see basic Navy.

346
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:38,466
It does not matter where go Nami-san and Robin-chan,
it is always a paradise for me!

347
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:39,238
Imbecile!

348
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:39,846
Hein?

349
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,243
I said that you were an imbecile!

350
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:41,994
Imbecile!

351
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:44,376
Ok, I will repair the hole in the hull.

352
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:48,094
Ah, but me, I have the flagstone!

353

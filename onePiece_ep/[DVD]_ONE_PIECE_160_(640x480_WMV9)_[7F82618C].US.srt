1
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
In search of great adventures,

2
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,560
Luffy and its crew have finally
reached the celestial island, Skypiea.

3
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,470
At this point in time Nami and the others are
removed to undergo the Celestial Judgment.

4
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,580
Luffy and the remainder of the crew goes
on the island of God to join them…

5
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,420
and they face the innumerable ones
dangers throughout the way.

6
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,380
GOMU GOMU NO…

7
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,650
BAZOOKA!!!

8
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,480
Meanwhile, Nami and others
find on the Sacrificial Furnace bridge.

9
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,380
These Priests are on
this island, them too!

10
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,250
And you are not supposed
to attract you the lightnings of God!

11
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,960
It is right good sense!

12
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,800
Afflicted, I do not have…

13
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,450
ever venerated of God.

14
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,330
Thus, Zoro, Nami and Robin entrusted it
boat with Chopper, and entered the forest.

15
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,220
It IS ME WHICH AM MORE IN DANGER!

16
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:58,160
Chances of survival:10%!
Satori, capacity of Mantra!

17
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,640
Then, where is it, this God?

18
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,360
Being God, it must already be in
train observing our movements.

19
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,900
Ca would go more quickly if it
its bottom by here brought back.

20
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,660
I prefer that it remains where it is!

21
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,330
How must I say it to you
so that you me listenings?

22
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,410
God of this island
puts itself quickly in anger!

23
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,880
Oh, Lord God, have pity
us, please…

24
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,750
Oh! And please, help me
to find full with treasures.

25
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,200
I knew that you will say that!

26
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,250
In any event, to skirt
river will not carry out us nowhere.

27
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,800
Let us cross it to see a little
what there is other side.

28
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,110
Good idea.

29
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,430
But, how
will one cross?

30
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,180
With lianas like presently?

31
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,690
Or perhaps that there is a tree…

32
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,050
These bloody nuisances are there them too!

33
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,340
I give up!

34
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,180
I will not cross this river!

35
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,630
I refuse to be devoured by
a band of celestial sharks!

36
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,160
But, it is necessary that one seeks
the other side of the river too.

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Not it is not!

38
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,200
If you want so much of there
to go, Zoro, all alone go ahead!

39
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,750
Hein?

40
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,770
If you ace so much fear, were necessary
not to come here as of the beginning!

41
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,750
He!

42
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,780
Ground here…

43
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,470
What does it have the ground?

44
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,600
It is ground.

45
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,380
Ouais, obviously.

46
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,600
It is the ground.

47
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,180
One is on the celestial island.

48
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,130
It rightly.

49
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,490
It is not soft whole.

50
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,170
Oh, it is true. The celestial island
is abriquée starting from îlonimbus.

51
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,060
One would say that made of the years that
I did not touch ground like that.

52
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,950
Then, why this
is island different?

53
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,770
At all events, it would be said that there is
strange islands even among the celestial islands.

54
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,600
It would be said that is really worth
the sorrow to explore this place.

55
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,880
A crime of Class 2…

56
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,830
Don't they know anything God?

57
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,980
Choose your Ordalie.

58
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,310
One makes you gift of it.

59
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,800
To live in fished it is
to live in ignorance.

60
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,580
The way of your peace
do not lead to the Paradise.

61
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,010
Ordalie of the Marshes.

62
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,010
Marsh!

63
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,530
Ordalie of Iron.

64
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,530
Iron!

65
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,040
Ordalie of Wire.

66
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,040
Wire!

67
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,470
Ordalie of the Bubbles.

68
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,470
Bubbles!

69
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,330
You can choose only one of them!

70
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,470
Then? What does one have to make?

71
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,350
Ok!

72
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,420
It left for
Bubbles! bubbles!

73
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,270
Why, Luffy?

74
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,080
Ben, that with the funny air.

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,630
It is that your reason?!

76
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,550
It is of Ordalies!

77
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,350
It is not supposed to be funny!

78
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,410
But… I am for the Bubbles too.

79
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,710
It is the only one which
the air does not have violent.

80
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,510
I imagine…

81
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,850
For example…

82
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,310
If the Marshes are chosen…

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
I RUN! SOMEBODY…!

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,810
I have the feeling that if that one is chosen, one
will start to run and one will be able to never leave.

85
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,830
And Iron then?

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
ONE SE WILL MAKE CRUSH!

87
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,370
Rejected!

88
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,170
It is too much risky!

89
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,530
And Wire?

90
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,660
Ca appears too easy. It is not
not so dangerous for one…!

91
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,200
TOO MUCH HIGH!!

92
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,680
Average step.

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,170
On a side that seems not very dangerous, but
other it is a little too suspect.

94
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,410
A BUBBLE! IT IS ENOOORME!!

95
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,860
It is can beings of
round and soft spheres,

96
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,860
but what would arrive if
did one of them pass to us above?

97
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,360
One must just pay attention.

98
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
A choice should be made.

99
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,060
One is there almost.

100
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,790
Bubbles!

101
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,820
Let us take the Bubbles!

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,380
O-Ok! In such a situation,
made confidence with the instinct of Luffy.

103
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,060
Then it is decided.

104
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,630
But not of imprudence.

105
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,720
We are on the island of God with
10.000 meters above the sea.

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,040
Nobody knows which
bizarreries await us.

107
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,340
ALLONS-Y! BUBBLES!

108
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,550
He, Ho! Do not close them
eyes now, driver!

109
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,330
Even open, it is always very black!

110
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,870
Ah, He. You know with
what that makes me think?

111
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,970
Q-what?

112
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,510
You know why it
there had four doors?

113
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,330
One of them is the good one,
and all the others are traps.

114
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,730
Hein?! About what you speak?!

115
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,350
Why you say that NOW?!

116
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,630
And if one had taken the bad one?!

117
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,610
If one were mistaken…

118
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,940
Ben…

119
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,840
One perhaps will fall
celestial island.

120
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,450
DOES NOT THINK OF it! I
will fall from nothing the whole!

121
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,800
10.000 meters us
separate from the Blue Sea!

122
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,090
You ACE an IDEA OF the NUMBER OF TIMES OR MT LIFE GOES
TO RAVEL IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES DURING THIS FALL?!

123
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,440
SAME A FALL MUST HAVE A LIMIT!

124
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,300
Stop with these conneries!

125
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,260
It is impossible that…

126
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,440
NOOOOOON!!!

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,800
CA CANNOT BE TRUE!!!

128
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,910
One is alive.

129
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,960
I believed…

130
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,560
that one did really one
fall of 10.000 meters…

131
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,140
It IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE INVENTS
THIS WEAK HISTORY, LUFFY!

132
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,070
I flippé!

133
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,520
I believed that one was going to die!

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,470
Then, it is what this place?

135
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,980
They are bubbles.

136
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,900
Bubbles.

137
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,910
They are small bubbles of îlonimbus.

138
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,950
Too much cool!

139
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,940
Large flocons de neige would be said!

140
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,310
This place is really odd!

141
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,910
It is funny!

142
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,540
And Milky Road goes up
through the trees…

143
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,480
Good, it is what the principle
of Ordalie, then?

144
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,950
No idea.

145
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,520
The ideal would be that it does not occur anything,
but I doubt that it is also easy.

146
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,610
Perhaps that the good one was chosen!

147
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,990
If one had chosen
a different entry,

148
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,690
perhaps that one would be undergoing
a terrible destiny now, hein?

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,970
Ouais!

150
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,950
Perhaps that you are right!

151
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,810
You see!

152
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,490
Morons!

153
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,780
Did not say silly things!

154
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,570
Who could create a door well
gaining for criminals?

155
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,880
Reflect just a second!

156
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,060
There must be traps
hidden like presently.

157
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,140
Remain vigilant.

158
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,170
In any event, let us continue straight!

159
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,840
I have soiffe.

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,100
Let us take tea!

161
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,310
Ah, it is an good idea.

162
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,070
Make Peter the senbei in your bag!
[Senbei:rice cookies to soya.]

163
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,630
Ah, good idea!
[Senbei:rice cookies to soya.]

164
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,160
YOU THEM GUY…

165
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,200
Ben what, one cannot
to eat a celestial senbei?

166
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,390
Ouais! Let us eat! Let us eat!

167
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,400
NOT!
Ouais! Let us eat! Let us eat!

168
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,090
Listen!

169
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,940
I will continue to lead!

170
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,160
You them guy, open the eye!

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,470
Ouah, I had not realized
that one was so high.

172
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,310
They is curious…

173
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:06,800
They said that there were four Priests, I thus have
thought that each of the four doors would lead to the one of them.

174
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,270
Was I mistaken?

175
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,920
He, Usopp! Passes!

176
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,300
Of agreement!

177
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,270
Ok, ok! Passes!

178
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,240
I AI KNOWN AS OPEN the EYE!

179
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,140
A snake!

180
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,130
Dumb!

181
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,090
RELEASE!!!

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,460
He frightened me.

183
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,600
It is what this brothel?

184
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,590
SANJI! RIGHT IN FRONT! A CLOUD!

185
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,820
SEND TO IT VASLER!

186
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,490
Shit! All these floating tricks
are thus eggs of snake?!

187
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,170
Not possible…

188
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,550
WHAT SE PASSES
WITH THESE BUBBLES, BROTHEL?!

189
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,540
It is amusing to see what will leave!

190
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,560
I name them the Clouds Surprised!

191
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,680
Clouds Surprised?

192
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,280
Heso!

193
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,020
Who are you?

194
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,470
Thank you to have chosen
my Ordalie of the Bubbles!

195
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,570
[Priest of Skypiea ~ Satori of the Forest]

196
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,470
It is what its problem
with this large heap…?

197
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,870
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

198
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,830
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

199
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,520
Is it one of the Priests?

200
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,130
Then it is you Ordalie of the Bubbles!

201
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,410
Be to you a Bubble?!

202
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,580
DECREE OF DANCER!

203
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,110
You ES WHICH, BROTHEL?!

204
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,780
What…? It with the air
more stupid than I believed it.

205
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,240
Nami and the papi did not have
known as what were they super forts?

206
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,450
He, bouboule!

207
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,390
You ace interest so that Nami-san and
the others are healthy and safe!

208
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,870
Offerings?

209
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,110
I do not know.

210
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,340
If they are left all
only, they will die.

211
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,040
And so by chance they escape,
they will die nevertheless!

212
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,680
WHAT?!

213
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,030
You would owe you rather
to worry for yourselves.

214
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,060
To be frank, you will have me
to beat before being able to go further!

215
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,340
I it arrives!

216
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,110
Luffy, go ahead!

217
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,890
Burst it!

218
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,780
Ok!

219
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,020
I will send it in orbit!

220
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,930
GOMU GOMU NO…

221
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,630
Oh! You can stretch your members?

222
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,040
GUN!!!

223
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,860
SHIT!

224
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,090
LUFFY!!

225
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:28,730
Luffy?

226
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,660
He! You are well, not truth?

227
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,340
It is not a small blow of
fist as that which will sound you!

228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,620
A punch?

229
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,220
It is a little different
of a punch.

230
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,820
That there is
if different?!

231
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,590
A kick with the face, right leg.

232
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,590
COLLAR…

233
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,650
What?

234
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,630
A capacity reserved for those
who practice art…

235
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,550
of Mantra.

236
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,440
Impossible!

237
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,460
It anticipated my blow?!

238
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,330
SANJI!!!

239
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,140
It is not a punch.

240
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,960
Impact!

241
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,310
The shock wave attacks
your body of the interior.

242
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,880
Shit…

243
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,480
Sanji, Usopp!

244
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,340
Ca goes.

245
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,910
But what it
we made this dumb?

246
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,600
No idea.

247
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
He has funny trick in his sleeve.

248
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,160
My name is Satori!

249
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,210
I am one of the Priests to the service
of our Very Powerful God, Eneru!

250
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,880
I control Vearth
lost Forest!

251
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,840
The Lost Forest?

252
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,680
Yes.

253
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,560
It is the name of this forest.

254
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,890
And…

255
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,540
it is your boat which is lost!

256
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,640
The boat moves all alone!

257
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,000
The boat now will travel without goal to
through this forest, along Milky Road,

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,860
until reaching
only and single exit.

259
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,790
If you would not know it…

260
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:22,230
To lose your boat with Dial wants to say to lose
the road leading to the Sacrificial Furnace bridge.

261
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,960
You must recover your boat
before it is too late.

262
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,130
Of course, this army of Clouds Surprised
and myself drudges of you to prevent some.

263
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,720
Welcome with the Crowned Earth
prohibited, Upper Yard!

264
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,820
Your chances of survival in
the Lost Forest are of 10%.

265
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,340
Ordalie of the Bubbles!

266
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,990
Chances of survival… 10%…

267
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,760
ZORO!

268
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,140
NAMI!

269
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,380
ROBIN!

270
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,140
DO NOT LEAVE ME ALL ALONE!

271
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,170
RETURN!

272
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,680
Who will save me if I
make me attack…?

273
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,610
It is because of Luffy which wanted to go on
the celestial island which I must suffer like that…

274
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,180
I am sure that Luffy and them
others are with our research.

275
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,750
It is true. Luffy and them
others will come here.

276
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,570
Of course! I owe just me
to clear up until they arrive!

277
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,540
I will avoid the troubles and
to await Luffy and others.

278
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,580
And I think that I go
to repair the boat too.

279
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,530
Zoro entrusted it to me, after all.

280
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,750
Good!

281
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,610
When Luffy and the others will see good work
that I made by taking care of the boat myself…

282
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,040
The hammer!

283
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,590
I… I must go to recover it.

284
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,930
But…

285
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
Come now, if you made not quickly, your
boat will be inserted very far in the Lost Forest!

286
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,440
H-He, it is necessary to catch up with it
boat or one will lose sight of the fact it!

287
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,100
If one loses sight of the fact it in this forest,
one will be able to leave never again from here!

288
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,380
Wait, Usopp!

289
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,610
Ca will be similar if one
finds itself separate!

290
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,070
Luffy, which made is?

291
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,610
Recover the boat!

292
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,060
I will give a lesson to the large heap!

293
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,490
Can you really?

294
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,210
Good fortune and
pride are my allied!

295
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,930
Somebody must stop this Daruma.
[Daruma:round toy with rocker]

296
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,770
Pay attention!

297
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,680
This type has odd capacities!

298
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,970
I will return as soon as
I will have the boat!

299
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,590
Ok

300
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,190
Remain where you are, Bouboule!

301
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,690
It catches the branch and then…

302
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,090
GOMU GOMU NO…

303
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,330
Still the same thing?

304
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,360
GUN!

305
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,930
Lighter!

306
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,740
What doesn't go?
You were not to beat me?

307
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,160
Ouais!

308
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,260
I said it, therefore I do it!

309
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,580
I will not louperai you this time!

310
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,520
GOMU GOMU NO…

311
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,830
It makes pretense that it is a blow
of fist, but it is a kick.

312
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,350
MUCHI!
[Muchi:Whip]

313
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,610
Lighter!

314
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,460
And still!

315
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,710
GOMU GOMU NO…

316
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,590
Where it is?!

317
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,620
Where is the Small Corbel?!

318
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,280
It should be caught up with!

319
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,680
Shit! I cannot see it from here.

320
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,680
Good!

321
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,230
Make attention, Luffy!

322
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,450
These Priests are not ordinary!

323
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,350
It is necessary to find the boat and
to release from here as quickly as possible!

324
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,300
Shit!

325
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,150
J-J' does not manage to leave it!

326
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,040
You are resistant.

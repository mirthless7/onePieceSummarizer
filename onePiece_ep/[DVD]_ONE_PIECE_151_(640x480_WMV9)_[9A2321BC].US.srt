1
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,470
One precisely spoke about you.

2
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,090
You want something?

3
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,420
Ouais!

4
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,880
Return the gold which you stole
in Papi Head of Diamond!

5
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,600
Gold?

6
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,140
You want to say that of the old Cricket?

7
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,300
I will return to him who flagstone!

8
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,810
I stole it to him, as a pirate.

9
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,660
You are a pirate you also, then
you do not have lessons to give me.

10
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
However if.

11
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,550
These guy are my friends.

12
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,720
Then I theirs will return.

13
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:55,150
ichi oku No otoko

14
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:55,150
The man has 100 million!

15
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:55,150
The greatest council of the world
and the pirate Beard Black!

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:55,150
sekai saikou kenryoku
to kaizoku kuro hige

17
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,630
I would like to know…

18
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,370
You can fight?

19
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,890
Do you can at least strike?!

20
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,060
What have I to fear of one
weakling like you?

21
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,490
W-were right…

22
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,380
It is well him!

23
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,850
Eh! What you
swings still with this trick?

24
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,940
You can make confettis of them!

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,420
But, and if this opinion of
was research a truth?

26
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,690
If it is worth really 100
Million Berrys…

27
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,310
Bellamy will be never
enough extremely for…

28
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,620
Ridiculous!

29
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,990
Look at to me this kid!

30
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,140
One in vain looks it from every angle,
it does not have anything a dangerous murderer.

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,330
I really start to doubt
this poster to 30 Million me too!

32
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,210
If you remainders planted to tremble
of fear like presently…

33
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,290
you risks not of me
to take again anything.

34
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,690
Lopette!

35
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,600
This afternoon, it was different.

36
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,730
It is that!

37
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,780
In what is this different?

38
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,010
This time I will make sure that you
will miss me never again of respect!

39
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,110
Ca collapses!

40
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,690
One will finish some quickly!

41
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,610
SPRING SNIPE!

42
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,860
He! Straw hat jumped!

43
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,240
Small maggot!

44
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,240
What it came
to make here, this snotty-nosed kid?

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,900
Bah, let us admire the show of Bellamy!

46
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,710
It had a large mouth, but there one
would say rather than he flees like a yellowbelly!

47
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,860
I see any difference.

48
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,970
Nothing changed since presently!

49
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,260
I believed that you had
to take again gold to me!

50
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,530
You ace that mouth!

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,870
You do not make the weight vis-a-vis me!

52
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,670
Be right good for you with radoter
with your stupid dreams!

53
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,220
For which you want to be made pass?!

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,180
It falls us above!

55
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,920
We draw!

56
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,090
You can fight as much as you want.

57
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,710
Nobody can escape
with my capacities Hamper Hamper.

58
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,710
[Note:Hamper = Spring]

59
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,180
Be already re-silvered to you?! What a shame!

60
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,640
This snotty-nosed kid is really not
of size to face Bellamy.

61
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,520
Do not say to me that he already died!

62
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,850
It was raised!

63
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,590
I do not have the intention
to finish some so quickly!

64
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,740
I am on the point of
to begin the true show!

65
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,750
SPRING HOPPER!

66
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,720
Bellamy disappeared!

67
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,390
It is the technique with which
it spread out Roshio the Executor!

68
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,800
These guys are your FRIENDS?!

69
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,130
Ah yes, it is true that this old man and
its monkeys are same species as you!

70
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,390
A band of morons who gobent the lies
of a dead type four hundred years ago!

71
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,680
Which Gold City?

72
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,240
Which celestial island?

73
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,420
The COMPLETED ERA OF the DREAMERS EAST!

74
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,770
YOU ES THE SHAME OF THE PIRATES!

75
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,430
Do I can strike?

76
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,520
Stop it, Bellamy!

77
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,330
The good-for-nothings as do not deserve to him
no food in the real-world!

78
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,560
GOOD-BYE, STRAW HAT!

79
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,960
He, Bellamy, stop blaguer!

80
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,100
Go!

81
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,890
You cheeks the comedy, not true?

82
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,060
Say something!

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,340
He, Bellamy!

84
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,050
Stop talking cock!

85
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,520
Be raised and made us
your usual show!

86
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,600
Bellamy!!

87
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,930
You have a premium of 55 Million
Berrys, you remember?!

88
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,670
Exact! Guys of this afternoon…

89
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,190
They have both a premium
higher than holds, Bellamy!

90
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,000
T you see, I had said it!

91
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,870
The gold of Papi.

92
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,940
Return it to me!

93
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,130
To repair the boat!

94
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,830
To hoist the prow!

95
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,840
They have fishing, these guys!

96
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,560
It is done!

97
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,910
They took one removed rust from
and they are already on feet!

98
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,670
And even while Chopper
look after their wounds…

99
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,540
They recover drôlement quickly!

100
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,630
Why you did not accompany it?

101
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,320
Hein? But it is what your problem?

102
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,080
A blow it is “does not fight! ”…

103
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,140
The other, it east “fight! ”…

104
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,310
Then, “does not go there! ”…

105
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,190
And “Go ahead!”.

106
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,640
It is not what I wanted to say.

107
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,940
But you also, you are
taken a beating, not?

108
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,220
A beating?

109
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,590
It is not as if they were
across our way.

110
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,440
I do not like to fight
adversaries which make me pity.

111
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,970
What do you tell?

112
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,620
Be to you idiot or what?

113
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,490
The farm! Insane me the camp!

114
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,410
You me genes!

115
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,600
What you ace?!

116
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,480
Always make of it you that at your head!

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,670
Why I would listen to you?!

118
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,490
He Ho! Made blunder,
species of morons!

119
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,810
Ben, surely because
I am right always!

120
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,710
This boat is our
well most invaluable…

121
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,180
Break from there!

122
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,180
He! Stop-that, cretins!

123
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,760
What you ace?!

124
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,760
Never repeat that!

125
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,780
Ca is enough, band the weak ones!

126
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,080
I have it! I have it!

127
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
This species of dwarf…

128
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,480
It was a blow of bowl…

129
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,100
HE, JERK!

130
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,240
WAIT!

131
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,170
I AM ALWAYS, YOU DO NOT SEE?!

132
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,560
GO, BRINGS ITSELF!

133
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,830
Y' does not have average that one loses in front
a stupid dreamer in your kind!

134
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,840
WHAT THERE IS?!

135
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,190
OR YOU GO, STRAW HAT?!

136
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,520
Where?

137
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,390
In the sky!

138
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:09,240
Then these types made fall Sir
Crocodile, one of the Captains Corsairs…

139
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,610
Monkey D. Luffy and Roronoa Zoro.

140
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,480
Santoryu Ougi!

142
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,560

[Three thousand worlds]

144
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,970
To strike a man in the back
is humiliating for a sword-man.

145
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,540
Admirable.

146
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,040
EXCEED me!

147
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,960
RORONOA ZORO!

148
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,010
Then as that these kids attracted
attention of the World Government, hein?

Holy Land, MarieJoa

152
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,260
How?

153
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,010
The Russet-red one?

154
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,230
Yes, its intrigues
become worrying.

155
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,490
Lastly, it is not like if it
had moved in person.

156
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,290
Exact!

157
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,890
It is about an action
indirect using a messenger.

158
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,850
But all the same!

159
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,880
A meeting between White Beard
and the Russet-red one is really dangerous!

160
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:40,180
[Note:Sekai Seifu Saikou Kenryouku = greatest political authority in the world; Gorousei = the Council of the Five Seniors]

161
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,800
Hum. It is exact, indeed.

162
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,300
However, if we let the Russet-red one become insane
furious, it could escape our control…

163
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,470
Nevertheless, it does not have the ambition
to change the world with him all alone.

164
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,060
Satisfy we to observe it
without making hasty decisions!

165
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,180
In the immediate future, which imports, it is
the problem of the Seven Powerful Corsairs.

166
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,820
We must quickly find
a substitute with Crocodile.

167
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,920
It is advisable to fill
this vacancy.

168
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,540
If the Three Great Capacities came to
to crumble, the world itself would fall of pieces.

169
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,500
Measures should be taken.

170
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,810
Well!

171
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,640
This is why we have already
convened the Seven Powerful Corsairs.

172
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,440
But I am unaware of how much enter
they will answer the call.

173
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,790
They are pirates after all,
they make any only at their head.

174
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,530
Rotten Crocodile…

175
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,430
With your schemes, you have us
put in a delicate situation.

176
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,300
And as regards this
man who overcame it…

177
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,470
We cannot any more leave it
to run the seas with impunity.

178
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,290

Stop…

187
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,190
What takes to you?!

188
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,690
It is not me!

It is not the moment to joke!

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,470
It is not a joke!

193

I do not control myself any more!

194

How if I went gober that!

195
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,190
Ca is enough! What
you have both?

196
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,310
You want to kill me?!

197

198

202
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,430
I know that it is you, Doflamingo!

203
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,670
Stop that immediately!

204
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,470
If I do it, say us
what one has to say…

205
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,770
and let us stop with
this stupid meeting!

206

209
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,650

210

Enough!

211

I am happy that you came.

216
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,840
And well, terrible opinion
that you have us.

217
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,480
, Want you start?

218
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,310
I guess that nobody any more will come.

219
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,800
In to have joined together two on
six exceeds already my hopes.

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,400
You astonish me!

221
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,230
I did not want to come either.

222
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,660
But the businesses go so well
on the island which I am désoeuvré.

223
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,020
Therefore, here me is.

224
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,590
I see. It is rather
painful to hear.

225
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,580
There is nothing more opposing to learn
that the businesses of the pirates go so well.

226
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,960
You are of provocative mood.

227
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,500
It is not worthy of Buddha, that…

Admiral as a Sengoku Chief.

229
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,900
I believed to hear a futile discussion.

230
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,620
Would I be misled to me in place?

231

235
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,720
Ben, known as thus!

236
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,520
You stays well the last that
I expected to see arriving.

237
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,860
I would never have believed… but you…

238
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,790
What?

239
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,180
I am here only in so much
that simple observer.

240

241

It is all.

242
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,530
In this case, will not see you objections
so that I assist with this meeting me too?

243
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,750
Lastly, not completely in
as long as simple observer.

244
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,660
Good god, but which are you?

245
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,280
How you entered here?!

246
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,070
And well, I did not expect to see
so many prestigious characters brought together here.

247
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,880
By chance…

248
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,780
… this meeting…

249
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,240
… I came to assist to with it…

250
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,410
… and to take share there.

251
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,150
I learned that Crocodile
its place had lost…

252
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,330
and I wondered to times you whether
would not seek a successor to him.

253
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,890
You…

254
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,090
You would be Laffite?!

255
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,720
Laffite?

256
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,740
Oh, I see that you know me.

257
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,990
I am very honoured.

258
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,770
It was a famous guard
peace of West Blue…

259
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,490
But its inclinations for the ultra one
violence cost him the exile.

260
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,230
It is old story.

261
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,930
But what you think
of me imports little.

262
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,240
I came to propose a certain person
within the Seven Powerful Corsairs.

263
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,300
Shanks…

264
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,350
Ca makes a long time that I
did not hear this name.

265
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,940
Then like that, this
is letter of Shanks?

266
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes.

267
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,360
It appears that it is very important…

268
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,680
It thus sent me to be ensured
that it would arrive at good port.

269
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,630
Congratulation. Ca did not have
to be easy to arrive up to now.

that I officiate in piracy.

273
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,530
I must say that I am rather famous.

274

He, you over there!

275
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,530
You already intended to speak
of Rockstar, not true?!

276
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,650
Not, that says anything to me.

277
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,660
And then, he said that the King of the Seas was
the best thing than it had ever tasted…

278

Wait!
Q - What!

280

he believes so important?!

281
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,590
He, But wait!

282
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,990
Okashira specified well that this
letter was very important!

283

[Note:Okashira = Chief]

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,230

to speak about Russet-red there!

285

287
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,930
Captain, you drank alcohol too much.

288
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,360
Idiot!

289
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,580

then that cannot make me of evil.

290
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,100
Okashira said that this
letter was urgent!

291
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,290
I guess what it acts.

292
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,030
It is about Ace and Barbe Black.

293
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,450
You will say to this snotty-nosed kid
of Carrot Hair…

294
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,320
that if it has something to say to me, it would make
to better bring to drinking and to point itself!

295
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,880
You can lay out now.

296
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,230
I have to better do than to discuss
with a small scrapings like you.

297

Y' does not have what to laugh, Okashira!

301
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,180
I suspected that
would happen like that.

302
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,690
Give me more time!

303
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,490

important that honor.

There is no more only you can make.

311
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,550
You gave him what to reflect.

to make, Okashira?

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,640
Just.

318
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,790
You believe that the Government
will remain without anything to say?

What?

321

The Government
that will surely not tolerate…

322
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,210
But if they are put transversely
from our road, that will heat!

323

Ahead the guy!

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,130

Yes.

of our pirate crew.

If nobody know it…

331
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,580
it could never be used for
to impress the other pirates.

332
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,670
Exact, we of it are conscious.

333

Moreover we prepare one
small operation to cure it…

a little more time.

335
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,780

100 Million…

343
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,820
I found that 30 Million it was not
sufficient for a kid with so much of ambition…

344

But, as long as that…

to irritate me this evening!

I am not interested in small fish!

351
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,450
It is at least a head with 100
Million that we needed!

352
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,100
I aim at the gold mine!

353
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,130

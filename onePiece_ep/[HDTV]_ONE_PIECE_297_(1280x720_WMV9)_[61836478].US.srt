1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Say a spell in your chest

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,829
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

19
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
Negai nara chiisana mune no naka

21

Kibou de jumon o

22
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
Kakereba...

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Kasoku shita yokan

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Nanairo no onpukana de

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Issho ni konai ka?

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
Bokura datenshi

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
Yume ni ya o hanatsu no sa

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Naniiro o kasanete ikou?

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Hitomi ni utsutta kanashii riaru o kowase

00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,829
Nukumori tsuki no hane o ageyou

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Shuuru na datenshi

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,990
Kokoro kara utau no sa

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,919
Wealth.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,159
Fame.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,179
Power.

37
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,930
The man who once owned everything,

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,109
The Pirate King,

39
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,810
Gold Roger.

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,439
The words he said before his death

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,349
sent all the people of the world

42
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,270
out to the seas.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,749
My treasure?

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,539
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,239
Find it!

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
I left everything in that place.

47
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,889
Men, searching for romance,

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,210
pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,609
The world is now

50
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,340
in the Grand Age of Pirates!

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,420
You need to listen to a navigator's weather forecast.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,210
Come!

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,260
The one from before...

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,410
Thunder Lance Tempo!

55
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,400
No matter how strong you are,

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,110
My forecasts are always right.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,409
My nakama are waiting.

58
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,190
I'm taking your key!

59
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,420
Chopper, it's us!

60
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,170
Stop it!

61
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,359
Oi, is that thing really Chopper?

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,010
Why the hell doesn't he recognize us?!

63
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,449
I don't know, but it has to be Chopper!

64
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,470
There isn't anything else with that hat and those horns!

65
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,109
Outta the way, you guys!

66
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,469
He's-

67
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,529
Franky!

68
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,110
What the hell're you trying to do, these guys are our-

69
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,190
I know, shut up.

70
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,819
This is the only solution.

71
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,989
Devil fruit users have one weakness...

72
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,229
I'll shoot him into the sea

73
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,300
Sorry, but this is what I have to do!

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,910
Coup de Vent: Strong gale

75
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,769
Franky, you bastard, what the hell're you doing,

76
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,600
You can't do that kinda thing to our nakama!

77
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,109
Don't worry.

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,690
We already worked it out together.

79
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,540
You're finally free?

80
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,820
Don't laugh, you should be regretful.

81
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,570
A chance to kill me like you could before will never come again.

82
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,540
World Government!

83
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,969
Introducing Sanji the Hunter?

84
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,550
An Elegy for the Lying Wolf

85
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
Battleships are coming to attack!

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,449
Get outta Enies Lobby!

87
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,199
They're gonna start shooting!

88
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,449
Everyone get off the island!

89
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,799
We're gonna get caught in the Buster Call!

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,280
If we stay here we're gonna die!

91
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,410
Wait, Nico Robin!

92
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,330
Even if you go back, the pirates will still be dead!

93
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,000
Stop being stupid!

94
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,860
Let's show her, Funkfreed!

95
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,050
Just up there is Luffy...

96
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,380
Don't kill her...

97
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,520
Ivory Dart!

98
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,019
You can't escape, idiot!

99
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,790
Don't mess with me!

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,590
Now let's go together... to the gate of dreams.

101
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,400
He's back to normal...

102
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,320
Doesn't look like he's dead.

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,280
And his nakama didn't even know how to deal with him...

104
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,240
Don't you wanna save Nico Robin?!

105
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,950
I want to!

106
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,730
Whatever, you did take out one of CP9.

107
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:29,090
Even if you did hurt me, I'll forgive you for your nakama's sake.

108
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,340
Time to get going.

109
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,630
No... even if I hurry, how do I get to the Gate of Justice...?

110
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,660
Show the way!

111
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,869
You guys!

112
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,750
We found Franky!

113
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,070
What, you know a tunnel that goes to the Gate of Justice?

114
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,110
We know! We're here to show people!

115
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,280
Baachan's here too.

116
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,089
Show me where it is quick!

117
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,329
Then I can tell you two and Kokoro what you need to do.

118
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,080
Roger.

119
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,960
He's unconcious, but it looks like he's okay.

120
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,849
Don't do that, you hag!

121
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,970
Are you even okay?!

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,159
No!

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,140
I've gotta go on ahead and get these keys to Nico Robin!

124
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,609
You guys grab the deer and follow me!

125
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,529
Yeah.

126
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,110
Got it! Good luck, Franky!

127
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,129
So, that's the only way to stop Chopper.

128
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,450
Now, you take the number three and four keys, and hurry to Robin

129
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,679
One of these might open Robin's handcuffs.

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,779
If one works, call me on this little Denden-Mushi the secretary had.

131
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,990
Got it.

132
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,010
Hanaking: Nose King

133
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,709
Sounds fine, but then what?

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:12,689
Even if we save Nico Robin, there's no bridge connecting this tower to Enies Lobby.

135
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,839
We won't be able to get back!

136
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,379
Yeah...

137
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,409
With the Buster Call coming, we won't even have time to go back.

138
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,559
So...

139
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,370
So we know what we have to do!

140
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,699
Behind us is the "waterfall of death", in front of us is the "path of mystery."

141
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,789
Which would you pick?

142
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,630
The front, of course.

143
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,429
So after we're all done in the tower, everyone will go to the Gate of Justice!

144
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,249
And after that, just leave it...

145
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,149
To you?

146
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,819
To luck!

147
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,630
To luck?!

148
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,009
We've

149
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,680
Wasted a lot of time.

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,030
Yes, you all have!

151
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,240
At a time like this, how could you two just fool around?!

152
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,949
Because he was being an idiot.

153
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,399
Both of you are idiots!

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,370
Now hurry up and get those keys!

155
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,580
Rankyaku

156
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,390
Sen: Line

157
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,569
Nice job following my orders, Zoro-kun!

158
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,279
Fight, Zoro!

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,760
You guys fight too!

160
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,010
That long neck...

161
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,560
Is your weak spot!

162
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,470
No it isn't!

163
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,610
I even have the ability to move it as I like.

164
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,860
And to attack...

165
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Bigan: Nose gun

166
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,069
W-what?

167
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,410
Just being nearby, there was that big of a shockwave?

168
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,949
He made a square hole in the rock!

169
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,950
That nose is even more impressive than Sogepp's!

170
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,969
W-who the hell is Sogepp?!

171
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,639
And stop the stupid comparisons!

172
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah, but Kaku's gotten really good at using his fruit's abilities.

173
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,469
W-wolf!

174
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,650
I-I'll be your opponent!

175
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,110
Don't get so worked up.

176
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,489
You guys... wanna save your nakama, right?

177
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,420
Y-yeah, I'm gonna take your key!

178
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,200
Take it.

179
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,520
And... go save Nico Robin.

180
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,680
What are you...

181
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,519
I... really don't like killing.

182
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,270
I can't stand blood.

183
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,940
Th-then... I'll take the key...

184
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,610
No! Look out!

185
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,860
Jusshigan: Ten Shigan

186
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,290
Don't let your guard down!

187
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,019
I'm a wolf.

188
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,370
I'll trick you and then eat you!

189
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,059
Usopp!

190
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,479
D-dammit...

191
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,940
What... am I doing?

192
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,110
What a stupid mask guy!

193
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,089
How 'bout you run around like before?

194
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,329
You were great at that!

195
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't make fun of me...

196
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,500
I don't have that kinda time anymore...

197
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,609
New Weapon Kabuto

198
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,980
Hissatsu Himawari Boshi: Sure Kill Sunflower Star

199
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,140
What, fireworks?

200
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,779
Usopp!

201
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,250
Geppou!

202
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,870
Stop!

203
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,069
Just like I promised...

204
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,639
I'll kill you fast.

205
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,339
It won't hurt.

206
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,100
You were safer when you were still stuck to your shepard.

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,419
But since the little lamb went wandering off alone...

208
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,670
Look...

209
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,450
Now the scary wolf's gonna eat you!

210
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,290
This is it!

211
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,509
Oi, let him go!

212
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,379
Damn wolf!

213
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,879
Don't kill him! Please!

214
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
We don't need your key!

215
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,339
Idiot!

216
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,590
You're gonna die next!

217
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,540
Rankyaku!

218
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,930
Shit...!

219
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,550
Now die!

220
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,160
USOPP!

221
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Who the hell are you?!

222
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,330
The hunter.

223
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,840
Die!

224
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,270
USOPP!

225
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,290
Sanji-kun!

226
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,710
Sanji...

227
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,920
How did you turn back to normal?

228
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,550
A bathtub fell down, and I was cured.

229
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,970
It was probably from the water...

230
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,150
But more importantly, Nami-san...

231
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,750
Did you fall in love with me all over again?

232
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,500
I wish the bathtub had hit you...

233
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,540
Hanapp: Nose + "pp" from Usopp's name

234
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,800
Now my name's nothing like Sogeking?

235
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,630
I-I'm sorry, Sanji-kun...

236
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,780
I...

237
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,310
I should...

238
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,599
As long as you're alive, it's fine.

239
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,650
Everyone has things they can and can't do.

240
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,030
Sanji...

241
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,370
You two, look outside.

242
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,200
No...

243
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,020
The Gate of Justice... is opening.

244
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,690
Robin...

245
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,009
If that gate opens and Robin-chan goes through it...

246
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,660
We can't cross the sea through it because of the Sea King nests,

247
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,909
And past that is the Undersea Prison and the Marine Headquarters.

248
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,649
Robin-chan will be completely taken away from us.

249
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,459
No...

250
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,130
Luffy didn't make it in time?

251
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,489
Shit, I can't hit!

252
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,850
And Robin's waiting for me...

253
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,209
Give it up.

254
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,360
You'll never see her again.

255
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,160
You won't be going past here.

256
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,949
Gomu Gomu no Gatling!

257
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,290
That isn't going to work.

258
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,730
Come on!

259
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,609
I said come on!

260
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,410
We're going to the bridge!

261
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,840
Can I make it?

262
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,279
The number three and four keys...

263
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,519
If one of them opens Nico Robin's handcuffs that'd be great...

264
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,470
But for now, I have to stop them!

265
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,930
Drawing...

266
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Chimney, hurry up.

267
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,099
The tower's gonna get attacked too.

268
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,289
Wait, baachan!

269
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,770
If I don't do this then the others will all get lost!

270
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,229
You must've run out of luck if you're fighting me.

271
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,890
I think you would've done better against Jyabura's abilities...

272
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,729
If you see them...

273
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,800
Tell them one thing:

274
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,810
You're fired.

275
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,190
Of course.

276
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,270
No, I'm fine with you.

277
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,990
Don't let that bravery get the better of you.

278
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,840
Hurry!

279
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,840
Oi, let me on!

280
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,039
You can't!

281
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,550
The Sea Train's completely full!

282
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,380
Get another ship ready!

283
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,390
Bastard, I thought you were just being calm!

284
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,179
You mean the whole time you had yourself tied up in your own rope?!

285
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,599
Yeah, I just took advantage of the situation.

286
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,139
Took advantage of it?!

287
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,280
The island's gonna go up in flames!

288
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,239
And we all just got left behind!

289
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,479
Yeah, but that means we got away from the marines.

290
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,410
We don't have time for this kinda thing, Galley-La!

291
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,029
They said something about a Buster Call...

292
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,120
Judging by how panicked they were,

293
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,389
I'd say we don't have much time.

294
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,439
How about Franky-aniki? And the Strawhat crew?

295
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,139
Those guys are invincible!

296
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,210
We don't need to worry about them!

297
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,170
Let's hurry and get off this island!

298
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,480
Ten battleships have set off towards the island of justice, Enies Lobby!

299
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,729
The situation... is the worst imaginable.

300
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,490
But even in this bad situation, there's gotta be a chance hiding somewhere.

301
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,870
Sanji...

302
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,540
Leave this guy's key to me.

303
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,510
Changing fighters?

304
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,970
Doesn't matter to me.

305
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,930
I'll do what you can't do,

306
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,640
You do what I can't do.

307
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,810
Think carefully!

308
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,610
Read the situation.

309
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,149
If you're here...

310
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,389
There's gotta be a way Robin-chan can be saved!

311
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,690
Usopp!

312
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,690
I want to live!

313
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,010
What I... can do?

314
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,579
Do you have time to pity that stupid woman?

315
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,799
Oi, be careful of what you say!

316
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,159
Next time on One Piece:

317
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,439
The Scorching Kick!

318
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,549
Sanji's Full-Course of Footwork

319
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,090
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

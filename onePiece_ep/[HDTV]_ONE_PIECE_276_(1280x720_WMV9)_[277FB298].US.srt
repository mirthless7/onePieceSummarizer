1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,810
Oi, is it true that a marine ship accosted here?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,340
Eh, a Marine ship?

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,220
Yeah, I heard it anchored there at dawn.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,070
Why would the Marines...

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,710
come to such a remote island again?

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,420
But there wasn't any marine to be seen around.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,760
What's that?

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,420
Just like a ghost ship, there wasn't anyone aboard.

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,140
This just can't be.

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,190
Professor!

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
Professor Clover!

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,410
Did something happen?

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,480
I don't think this can be

14
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,870
but a marine ship is accosted at the shore!

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,360
It might be an investigation.

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,060
We should take our precautions just in case.

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,460
Let the scholars know about this.

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,990
My raft is completed!

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,660
Then you're going?

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,590
What's that?

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,010
Why the openly sad face?

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,050
Oh yea, I thought about adding a flag or something.

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,470
I'll have to stay here a bit longer.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,690
To the sea...
Do you want to set out to the sea too, Robin?

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,800
My mother is always busy with her archeology researches,

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,960
but someday she'll come back to this island again.

27
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,770
I'll ask her to bring me with her to the sea next time.

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,480
I studied hard for this and became an archeologist.

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,430
An archeologist?

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,880
Even though you're so tiny?

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,370
But... You don't even remember your mother's face?

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,890
But she's my mother.

33
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,150
I want to meet her.

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,450
Do you know, Saulo?

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,990
The world has got an empty century whose history is unknown to everyone.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,030
Yea, that's the void century.

37
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm interested in it, but the government forbids all researches on it.

38
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,820
My mother is travelling across the world to study it.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,190
But you musn't tell this to anyone.

40
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,130
Because it's in fact a crime.

41
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,070
Does this mean she's searching for stones called Poneglyphes?

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,510
You know about Poneglyphes?

43
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,220
It doesn't matter!
Listen well, Robin.

44
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,000
You musn't talk about this in front of other people!

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,430
Your mother is looking around for these...!

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,230
What's wrong?

47
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,670
Robin, do you know your mother's name?

48
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,060
Olvia.

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,020
She's named Nico Olvia.

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Saulo?

51
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,180
Robin is Olvia's daughter.

52
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,530
Then could this place...

53
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,920
Be an island called Ohara!?

54
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,590
This is terrible! How can this be!?

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,440
Did I drift all the way to Ohara!?

56
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,540
This ain't the time for this!

57
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,620
Robin!

58
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,300
What?

59
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,100
It might surprise you, but listen to my story carefully.

60
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,810
Marine battleships should be heading to Ohara as we speak!

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,660
The Marines? Why?

62
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,750
To erase all the scholars on this island!

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,110
Erase them...?

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,390
You musn't...

65
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,080
This is a lie.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,740
...let the government guys...

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,320
That's a lie.

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,830
...know you're an archeologist!

69
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,320
All of this is a lie!

70
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,960
It's true!
I wouldn't lie to you!

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,130
You should go to the town right away and see if anything is wrong!

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,670
Your mother might be back too!

73
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,830
A Mother and Child Fate!
That Mother's Name is Olvia!

74
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,620
It's been a while, everyone.

75
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,750
Olvia!

76
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,990
Olvia-san!

77
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,380
So you were the one on that Marine ship?

78
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,850
Weren't captured by the Marines...?

79
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,370
Those are bad news to inform you of when I just came back.

80
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,600
But everything I've said is true.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,810
So this means the government finally set his eyes on this land.

82
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,950
Did you read the newspaper?

83
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,750
The research team that left Ohara 6 years ago to study the Poneglyphes...

84
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,330
All 33 members have been annihilated, all excepted me.

85
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,210
I was once caught by the Marine too.

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,820
After longly investigating the belongings of my slaughtered companions,

87
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,990
the government discovered we were from Ohara.

88
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,880
I cannot make any excuse.

89
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,670
Because of us, danger was brought upon this island.

90
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,790
Won't you stop!?
It isn't the fault of anyone!

91
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,150
The ones who set out to the sea and the ones who stayed here are all part of the same team.

92
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,590
Aren't you the ones who became victims?

93
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,170
You suffered a lot because of us.

94
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,050
Professor...

95
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,790
From the beginning, the government has seen Ohara as a threat

96
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,500
since it's a place where scholars from all over the one gather to study the history.

97
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,890
They probably think they've finally caught us.

98
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,380
They won't let this chance escape.

99
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,420
Indeed. But we managed to get this information in time.

100
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,740
They'll eventually try to erase all the scholars in Ohara!

101
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
So everyone should escape quickly from Ohara...!

102
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,210
That's right.

103
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,790
It seems that this time alone we won't be able to elude the investigation like every other time.

104
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,770
Since the government is striving to kill us.

105
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,350
Then hurry...!

106
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,030
But you know, Olvia.

107
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,780
I cannot let myself escape leaving those treasures of mankind behind.

108
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,250
Understand me.

109
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,740
We're the same, Olvia.

110
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,600
Everyone...

111
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,060
We don't know what does the government wants to do.

112
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,910
If we run away from here, we won't be able to protect the precious history.

113
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,790
We'll do all we can, this time too.

114
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,070
More importantly...

115
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,580
There must be something bothering you, right?

116
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,370
But... I can't meet her...

117
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,530
Make it clear, Olvia. Are you going to board the ship or not?

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,220
If you've got obligations towards your daughter, forget it.

119
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,480
We'll fulfill your husband's wish.

120
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,730
No, I'm going.

121
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,250
I'm a scholar of the land of Ohara!

122
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,240
I cannot give up on my ancestors' will!

123
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,550
I'm sorry, Robin. I'll solve all mysteries and certainly come back.

124
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,090
Where's mama?

125
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,600
Where my mom? Where did she go?

126
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,520
Your mom left for her job...

127
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,080
She set out on the sea!

128
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
You'll stay in this house meanwhile.

129
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,110
You're noisy!

130
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,530
If you don't shut up, I'll hit you!

131
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,700
Oi, oi, stop it. She's only two years old.

132
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
Our daughter is two aswell.

133
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't care if she's your sister's child or whatever,

134
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,760
how could you pick up such a thing?

135
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,420
Who is it!?

136
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
Don't move from there!

137
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,290
Uh... Excuse me...

138
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,100
I am... Hum...

139
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm sorry!!

140
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,350
Tell me when you want to read a book.

141
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,290
But... I don't have any money.

142
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,090
I don't need money.

143
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,690
You can read everything here for free.

144
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,580
For free?

145
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,170
Yeah. Since this is the best library in the world.

146
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
The world's best?

147
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,240
That's right.

148
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,330
By the way, you are Olvia's daughter, aren't you?

149
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,800
Do you like books?

150
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,760
She's a lot like you when you were young.

151
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,700
She's an unique genius aswell.

152
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,690
If she's fine... That's good...

153
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,570
Since I've walked this path already, I must sever all bonds.

154
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,960
I can't let her become the daughter of a criminal.

155
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,180
Professor Clover!

156
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,910
This time, it's ships aborning the World Government's flag!

157
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,540
Governement ships coming all the way to West Blue?

158
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,880
Are you sure?

159
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,260
The situation is quite serious.

160
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,080
Everyone, listen well.

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,420
I'm not one of your companions, nor am I one of your aquaintances.

162
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,640
Carve this in your heads.

163
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,110
Whatever happens.

164
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,470
Olvia, wait!

165
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,840
What are you doing?

166
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,790
Alright, tell hem we arrived.

167
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
Come on, come on, come on!

168
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,920
Hurry going in!

169
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,610
This is troublesome...

170
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,070
But this job might get me a promotion.

171
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,220
Oi. Restrain all of those wearing the name of scholar.

172
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,290
What happened?

173
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,420
A woman holding a gun is running around!

174
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,570
Such a terrible thing...!

175
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,010
I'm sorry, Robin...!

176
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,270
Vice Admiral Kuzan.

177
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,370
What?

178
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,540
Chief Spandine of the CP9 arrived at Ohara.

179
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,100
What's that...?

180
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,490
You absolutely had to wake me up...

181
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,310
JUST TO TELL ME THAT!?

182
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,640
I-I'm sorry!

183
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,040
What's wrong, Robin?

184
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,790
Did my mother come here?

185
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,240
What are you saying?

186
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,980
There's no way your mother could be in Ohara.

187
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,220
I must sever all bonds.

188
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,880
I can't let her become the daughter of a criminal.

189
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,870
What's wrong, all of a sudden?

190
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,730
That's right... It's terrible!

191
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,490
Marine battleships are coming to the island,

192
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,800
In order to capture all of the island's scholars!

193
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,450
Is there any panic in town?

194
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,640
What you're talking about aren't battleships, but government ships.

195
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,680
It seems like they've already docked on the island.

196
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,200
This will probably become one of the most severe investigation ever.

197
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,900
Listen, Robin. If you meet with people from gouvernment.

198
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,970
you mustn't let them know that you're an archaeologist.

199
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,050
Nobody will suspect you to be an archaeologist since you're so young.

200
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,030
You got it?

201
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,920
Move!

202
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,780
Stop working! Raise both hands in the air and get outside!

203
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,420
Isn't this a bit overly violent?

204
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,120
This Ohara research center is suspected of the enourmous
crime of deciphering the Poneglyph.

205
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,930
We'll be proceeding to a complete investigation,
so all of you must get outside immediately!

206
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,320
Don't do anything rash.

207
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,740
Everything here is too precious for you to understand its value.

208
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,500
I don't have to listen to this!

209
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,980
Take them outside!

210
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,800
To the population!

211
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,820
The scholars of this island are suspected of being devils,
wishing for the destruction of this world.

212
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,360
Why?

213
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,190
They're excellent scholars, well known throughout
the world, and they're the pride of this island!

214
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,350
From this point on, this enterie island will be
undertaking a full-scale investigation!

215
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,360
Consequently, people unrelated to archaeology...

216
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,440
should all head to the evacuation ship located
on the west shore, whit proof of identity.

217
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,390
Evacuation ship? Why go to such extremes?

218
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,140
If it's a problem with the scholars, we aren't involved with it!

219
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,150
There's no need to leave the island...

220
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,040
It was our duty to warn you.

221
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,980
If you wish to ignore this advice, 
whatever may happen to you...

222
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,740
It won't be any of our concern.

223
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,860
Get away from the city!

224
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,540
Evacuate to the west shore!

225
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,630
The world Gouvernment is planning to start something!

226
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,590
I've been shot! i'm done for! I'm done for!

227
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,100
Shit! Report! this to the upper management!

228
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,980
The title of chief should go to my son!

229
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,020
Chief, look carefully.

230
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,310
It only passed through the sleeve of you coat.

231
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,740
Oh, is that so?

232
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,540
The next bullet won't miss.

233
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,900
This is the criminal that wonderfully managed
to escape from the Marine's prison.

234
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,780
To belive you'd set foot on this island
by complete chance, Nico Olvia.

235
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:28,090
To have a woman who always kept denying her relationship
to the scholars of Ohara show up here.

236
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,100
It's like having her admit this is her homeland, you know...

237
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,010
Labeling this island's scholars with the
same crime as you in the process.

238
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,850
My being here doesn't qualify as any proof.

239
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,240
You must have prepared all kinds of excuses.

240
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,270
You're a clever woman.

241
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,360
But it's alright...

242
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,900
Your relationship with Ohara is no importance now.

243
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,060
If we check every nook and corner of this island,

244
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,870
We should find proof of you all studying
the Poneglyph right away.

245
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,030
The gouvernment is sure that the probability of that is 100%

246
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,970
The gouvernment only saw it as a small
incident to have caught all of you,

247
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,680
who've been running away here and there for six years.

248
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,490
When they'd catch Poneglyphes researchers from all over the world,

249
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,600
they would always search a connexion to Ohara.

250
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,820
Do you understand why?

251
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,680
Don't tell me... To set Ohara as an example?

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,930
Exactly.

253
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,810
if Ohara, the holy grounds of archeology, was to be crushed,
if would cause such an uproar in the scientific world...

254
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,740
We'll be able to demonstrate to the world the consequences of pursuing the Void Century.

255
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,210
Then... These battleships from the headquarters that are on stand-by must be...

256
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,300
Eh, how much do you know?

257
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,460
That's right.

258
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,450
They are there so that we don't let any of the criminal for the example escape.

259
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,010
But as a formality, we'll need to confirm if they're guilty or not.

260
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,310
Since we ain't pirates, after all.

261
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,440
That's why I purposely came here.

262
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,670
To chase down unvolved people from here,

263
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,980
after a compulsory investigation of this island.

264
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,750
Purposely.

265
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,100
Take her down.

266
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,030
Stop it! These books are the treasure of mankind!

267
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,700
He's still there!? Bring him out!

268
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,740
Shit! Bastards...!

269
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,170
It must be hidden somewhere!

270
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,900
You must absolutely find it!

271
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,330
This is terrible.

272
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,100
There are warships approaching from as far as I can see!

273
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,380
Is this all of them!?

274
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,270
Alright, gather all the scholars here!

275
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,170
Look, the scholars got caught.

276
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,860
What on earth did they do?

277
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,630
They were doing researches to destroy the world?

278
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,790
This must be a lie!

279
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,910
Where's the evacuation ship!?

280
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,070
At the west shore!

281
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,950
Hurry!

282
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,660
Rush there! To the west shore!

283
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,100
Robin.

284
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,140
It seems there's an evacuation ship.

285
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,680
We don't know what does the government plans to do anymore.

286
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,570
Hurry and go there too.

287
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,480
No! Even if I get on this ship, there isn't any kind people on it!

288
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,150
I'll stay here with everyone!

289
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,970
Robin.

290
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,870
But I'm the same as everyone...!

291
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,910
It's alright, just go!

292
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,720
How are you doing, gentlemen?

293
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,880
Good job, Chief-dono!

294
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,290
But you know...

295
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,780
It seems that a terrible beast appears in this island's forests.

296
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,720
I was almost killed...

297
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,890
Olvia!

298
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,050
Olvia-san...

299
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,530
Alright, listen well. This woman is a fugitive.

300
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,100
Her group was annihilated for the crime of deciphering ancient letters.

301
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,280
But we don't know about the crucial part.

302
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,920
But if you have...

303
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,300
a connexion with this woman, it makes things way easier.

304
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,950
Horrible. Even if she's a woman...

305
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,920
Robin, head to the evacuation ship. Hurry.

306
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,340
Robin...

307
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,230
Robin!

308
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,950
You've...

309
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,550
...grown so much.

310
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,800
Olvia.

311
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,840
What did he do?

312
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,250
What does he think this library is!?

313
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,840
To think you'd resort to such violence.

314
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,540
Ohh, we did it quite flashily.

315
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,110
Hello? Is the this chief-dono?

316
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,520
Yea, it's me.

317
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,030
We found it!

318
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,280
Hidden in the basement, there's a huge stone that seems to be a Poneglyph.

319
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,050
We've also found clear evidence of research on the ancient letters!

320
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,250
Alright, good work.

321
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,500
And now, scholars of Ohara!

322
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,850
Your capital sentence has been decided!

323
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,510
This is really too bad.

324
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,920
Now, on this very day, the world's best archeologists will lose their lives.

325
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,560
Look at this, what a disappointment.

326
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,440
So my job is finish!

327
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,530
We just need to report to the Gorousei now.

328
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,540
Roger.

329
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,070
Professor, will everyone will be killed?

330
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,200
It's a lie, right?

331
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,640
Is it really just for reading ancient letters? Why?

332
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,940
Idiot little brat!!

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,080
Their goal is to awake a powerful weapon and kill a bunch of people!!

334
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,900
That's a lie! Nobody thinks of doing that!!

335
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,770
Robin, please stop.

336
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,420
That lowly pawn of the government could never understand that.

337
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,210
WHAT!?

338
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,200
Is it really the weapons the government is afraid of?

339
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:03,690
Professor!

340
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,540
Professor Clover!

341
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,120
They're on the line.

342
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:06,850
Alright.

343
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,230
Very well.

344
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,590
Let me speak with the the Gorousei, the top of the world, before I die.

345
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,190
I'd like to report to them what we in Ohara strived their best to study all this time,

346
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,710
in other words, the hypothesis we've
formulated on the Void Century.

347
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,870
Trivial matters...

348
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,730
Oi!

349
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,350
Yes.

350
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,830
Robin, get away from here immediatly.

351
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,550
If you hear what I have to say, it'll become a crime.

352
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,540
Professor.

353
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,510
Oi, it seems that the scholars' crime has been confirmed.

354
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,760
Is this true?

355
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,080
Oi! There are marine battleships approching the west shore!

356
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,700
Something is about to happen!

357
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,930
Hurry to the evacuation ship...!

358
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,170
W-What!?

359
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,840
It's a Giant!!

360
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,560
Where are you?

361
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,490
Robin!!

362
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,540
Run away from this island quickly!

363
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,080
Saulo, take care of Robin!

364
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,550
Have my daughter escape at all costs!

365
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,610
What about mom? Won't you stay with me?

366
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,380
I still have things left to do here.

367
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,170
No! I don't want to be separated!

368
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,370
I just met you...

369
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,040
Mom!!

370
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,280
Next time, One Piece: Ohara's Tragedy! Terror of the Buster Call

371
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,480
I'll become the Pirate King!

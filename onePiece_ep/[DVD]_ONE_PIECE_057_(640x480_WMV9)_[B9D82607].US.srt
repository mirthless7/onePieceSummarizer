1
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:37,710
The isolated island at sea remote!

2
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:37,710
Legendary Lost Island

3
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,800
It uses Kamaitachi!

4
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,040
Over there!

5
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,050
They are ready!

6
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,510
On the way!

7
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,290
I will find you.

8
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,350
Well! On the way for Lost Island!

9
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,610
Ahead!!

10
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,180
Send messages to the chiefs of each unit!

11
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,500
How everyone repairs the bridge of the vessel-mother!

12
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,390
Where is the officer of maintenance?

13
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,120
Opposite the deposit!

14
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,580
Not, on the right on the right!

15
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,970
Use boards of another boat for repairs!

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,830
The team of repair!
Dispatch you to repair the vessel-mother!

17
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,810
These blasted pirates…

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,680
They gave up more quickly than envisaged.

19
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,650
It is not serious.

20
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,990
For the moment, let us let sail them with their ease.

21
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,030
What?

22
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,200
They are flee in a very clever way.

23
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,680
For which reason?

24
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,330
You forgot that this island contains a legend,

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,820
in connection with the localization of a nest of Dragons, the history of Lost Island.

26
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,520
What? Thus they…

27
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,720
It is only one presentiment.

28
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,860
Draw! Draw!

29
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,290
If I am right, they will carry out us directly over there.

30
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,380
A report/ratio with the Admiral Nelson?

31
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,000
That is not necessary.

32
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,930
But, Mister! I…

33
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,340
I sought during very a long time this Ryuukotsu.

34
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,020
Elixir of youth.

35
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,330
I will not leave this feeling reluctant Nelson Royale to put the hand above.

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,850
I will only keep it for me.

37
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,380
And Erik the Tornado will become invincible.

38
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,070
Where is it?

39
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,070
Your meat? Here!

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,250
The farm!

41
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,960
It is not that which I want!

42
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,680
Admiral Nelson Royal!

43
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,340
Oh, it is that until I waited!

44
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,110
You have the report/ratio of Erik?

45
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,110
Not, it is a report/ratio of the one of the soldiers in station in the Gunkan island.

46
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,830
Erik found one of legendary Sennenryu.

47
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,880
And, because of the damage on their ship, the whole fleet is occupied repairing it.

48
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,610
Erik…

49
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,860
Why didn't you say me that you had found Sennenryu?

50
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,340
You intend to only keep Ryuukotsu for you?

51
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,790
It is a mercenary after all.

52
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,650
That the principal fleet immediately puts the course on the Gunkan island.

53
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,210
How all the vessels install!

54
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,210
Lost Island?

55
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,830
To see the chart,

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,990
there do not seem to be other islands in the vicinity only that of Gunkan.

57
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,890
He… Ryuji-San!

58
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,830
By where must one go?

59
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,100
He…

60
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,340
It would be said that he still calmed down.

61
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,050
Afflicted to have made you wait!

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
The meal is ready!

63
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,810
Still of its kitchen?

64
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,720
I did not wait for that…

65
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,340
Oh oh, Sanji!

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,910
Excel!

67
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,650
You made the meal today?

68
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,160
Ryuji!

69
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,700
To eat…

70
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,250
It is the hour of the meal!

71
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,150
It is hot!

72
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,470
Cretin!!

73
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,310
It is extreme!

74
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,110
Ryuji!

75
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,440
Apis!

76
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,440
Ryuji!

77
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,560
Ryuji…

78
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,480
You are well?

79
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,970
Which misfortune,

80
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,400
you wasted the food which I had especially prepared for him.

81
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,270
You ace that with in repréparer.

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,030
What did I say to you on the wasting?

83
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,560
What y' has?

84
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,830
Lost Island…

85
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,570
The nest of the Dragons… is in the east of the Gunkan island.

86
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,840
It is there that Lost Island is?

87
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,590
Ryuji remembered some!

88
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,050
One succeeded!

89
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,500
Lost Island is in the east of the Gunkan island!

90
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,950
Ryuji has just said it!

91
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,890
It is perfect!

92
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,680
Usopp, come to help me!

93
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,970
Ok!

94
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,110
Well, on the way for Lost Island!!

95
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,830
Full sail!!

96
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,420
Cretin, you would do better all to eat!

97
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,710
Ouais! Worry you!

98
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,430
They changed course?

99
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,610
Yes!

100
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,760
The pirate vessel seems to have deviated its course towards the east of the Gunkan island.

101
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,370
They pass to the action.

102
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,170
How all the ships put the course at the east!
Maximum speed!

103
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,840
We must decrease the distance between us and the pirates of Straw hat.

104
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,510
How the artillerists arm the guns!

105
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,960
How the heads of unit prepare to order their units!

106
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,340
Our destination is…

107
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,790
Lost Island.

108
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,730
All vessels, ahead!!

109
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,780
Hold, Zoro.

110
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:11,990
Hold, Zoro.

111
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,230
Hold, Zoro.

112
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,110
Zoro…

113
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,600
Hold, Zoro.

114
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,990
, You are not obliged to you to say it each time know…

115
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,340
Some share in this immense ocean,
Lost Island awaits us.

116
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,380
I ask for myself which kind of place it east.

117
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,440
Do Usopp, you see something?

118
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,860
Nothing, nothing the whole!

119
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:44,740
I see.

120
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,960
You know what?

121
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,800
If the island ran, it is not by enchantment that it will appear in front of us.

122
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,910
You do not believe?

123
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,280
I hope that Ryuji will test

124
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,790
to remember a little more.

125
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,780
Ohhh, perhaps with that!

126
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,390
Let us give a blow on the head of Ryuji with that.

127
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,210
Perhaps that the shock will awake its hidden memories.

128
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,580
Do you want to release me well that?

129
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,070
He Ryuji! It is not far now!

130
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,530
Soon we will arrive at Lost Island!

131
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,370
It over there isn't this is?
The nest of the Dragons!

132
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,750
If you go on the nest of the Dragons, you will feel better!

133
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,160
What is there?

134
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,630
What a idiotic, he says already thank you!

135
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,420
One did not arrive yet!

136
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,140
Then they followed us…

137
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,740
It is what that? Smoke?

138
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,610
Eh well, I will know it is what when one is there.

139
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,840
Al!!

140
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,000
I am sure that are not idiotic for you!

141
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,130
What doesn't go?

142
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,990
He Ryuji you me listenings?

143
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,360
It would be said that Apis disputes.

144
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,940
They is not good for you to remain without anything to make! Say something!

145
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,000
It is as if Apis were put in all alone anger.

146
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,910
You believe that one should stop it?

147
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,870
A boat?

148
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,850
There is something of strange…

149
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,030
It is certain…

150
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,390
They is cool, Nami!

151
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,620
Come to see that!

152
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,650
I am… already looking at!

153
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,450
Where I passed?

154
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,660
The pirate vessel!

155
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,960
Where is it?

156
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,030
It disappeared!

157
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,240
How is this possible?

158
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,380
He, that did occur?
How did they disappear?

159
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,720
We do not know anything of it,

160
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,290
nothing the whole!

161
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,710
Stop the fleet!

162
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,070
Yes!

163
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,300
Say to them not to advance before to have had the order to do it!

164
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:45,670
Yes!

165
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,550
Continue in this direction.

166
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,770
Known as step of connery!

167
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,560
We do not know to only reserves this hidden side of the ocean us!

168
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,650
Nothing of nothing!

169
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,510
Still that?

170
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,010
Very well, give me a boat.

171
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,600
Wait… You…

172
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,180
It is exact.

173
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
I will only go.

174
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,210
What, of the fog?

175
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
I thought that it was more important so that Nami-San starts to shout.

176
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,380
What does it occur?

177
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,240
It is what this bazaar?

178
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,770
I saw the right boat in front of us and then…

179
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,710
we entered inside.

180
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,980
I see that flagstone!

181
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,670
It was almost… like a mirage.

182
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,000
A mirage?

183
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,770
Of course! I read it once in a book.

184
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,900
When the cold and hot sea water meet,

185
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,280
mirages appear on the sea!

186
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,770
And… it is also a mirage that?

187
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,520
What doesn't go with this ocean?

188
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,370
Dumb, looks at what you do!

189
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,240
I do not like that either, face of fart!

190
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,500
Sanji-Kun! Zoro!

191
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,650
I will return the sail!

192
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,840
Loosen the cords!

193
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,990
Yes, San!

194
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,830
You should remain in cabin!

195
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,790
Out of the question!

196
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,050
I must remain with Ryuji!

197
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,810
Cretin!

198
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,990
Remain with him will not help it at all!

199
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,880
Ryuji sat there without any help!

200
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,100
I must be with him!

201
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,870
You want to listen to me well good blood?

202
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,020
Quickly!

203
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,200
We will be in danger also if we remain on the bridge!

204
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,470
Which odd ocean…
It would be said that he wants to run the boat.

205
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,570
Ryuji!

206
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,220
Ryuji!

207
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,460
Am not afraid, the storm will not stop us!

208
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,610
Not!

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Zoro!

210
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:47,850
Ryuji!

211
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,790
Not, do not say that!

212
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
We will still fight!

213
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,910
You cannot give up now!

214
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,760
Didn't we promise to find the nest of the Dragons together?

215
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,230
Nami-San! I see light in front right!

216
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,610
It is the eye of the Typhoon!

217
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,510
He, I see an island under this light!

218
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,930
We must direct the boat over there!

219
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,560
Luffy!

220
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,790
They is good!

221
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,490
I promised to bring you to the nest of the Dragons, not truth?

222
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,030
Yes!

223
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,760
Then this storm surrounds the whole island,

224
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,100
like preventing people from returning.

225
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,850
To now anybody had not succeeded in finding this place.

226
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,240
It is surely due to this storm.

227
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,530
You know what? One would say more one floating castle on the sea that an island.

228
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,880
He! Look at that!

229
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,770
You do not find that with the shape of a dragon?

230
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,540
That must surely be the island of Sennenryu.

231
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,320
These dragons were to be very malignant!

232
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,040
Cretin!

233
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,770
They are the human ones which built these buildings.

234
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,350
Ben, it does not matter which did them…

235
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,400
We arrived! Lost Island!

236
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,630
In any case, I wonder since when there is no more life by here.

237
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,520
It seems that the jungle very covered for a long time.

238
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,680
Is Ah yes, according to you where the nest of the Dragons?

239
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,470
He!

240
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,810
Ryuji! Go, Ryuji!

241
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,730
We are on the island where the nest of the Dragons is!

242
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,930
Go, upright!

243
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,560
He says what?

244
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,550
He does not know.

245
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,370
Perhaps that it is not Lost Island.

246
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,390
What?

247
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,800
You laugh?

248
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,750
We had to cross a frightening storm to arrive up to now!

249
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,260
Apis!

250
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,380
Throw an eye at the top!

251
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,110
If we climb until there, one will be able to see the whole island!

252
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,890
It is true!

253
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,390
One gains nothing to remain here.

254
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,530
You want to go to see?

255
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,040
Yes!

256
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,550
Well! On the way!

257
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,900
That arranges Nami well,
they is the guys who make all the job!

258
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,730
Why it would not push a little bit?

259
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,800
He you over there!

260
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,750
Stop discussing and pushes a little more!

261
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,680
Stop of you foutre us, species of…

262
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,370
I will stop chattering and I will push more!

263
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,540
Ah, this charming

264
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,660
Close it!

265
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,460
A village?

266
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,730
All is in ruin.

267
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,830
As so people had really lived by here.

268
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,300
You can see it only by looking at the houses.

269
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,730
But why there is nobody any more here?

270
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,430
Who knows…

271
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,310
Perhaps that they found better elsewhere.

272
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,150
A Sennenryu toy.

273
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,410
Perhaps

274
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,660
that Sennenryu and the children of this island played with unit.

275
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,120
He! You are also friends of Sennenryu?

276
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,240
He Apis?

277
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,040
Do not remain behind.

278
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,940
You know what?
These birds said to me

279
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,270
that up there, there was a building with a drawing of dragon above.

280
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,190
Be serious for you?

281
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,610
Quickly, it is surely the nest of the Dragons!

282
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,500
Nami!

283
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,290
Hurry!

284
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,520
Await me!

285
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,140
One finally arrived!

286
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,990
I can about it more!

287
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,760
Thank you to have shown the way to us!

288
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,490
We surely took the longest way.

289
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,760
Thank you for your assistance friends.

290
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes, good job!

291
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,130
This drawing it is Sennenryu?

292
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,590
Yes, one would say.

293
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,610
It is this building the nest of the Dragons?

294
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,100
This place?

295
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,970
Do He wait one minute, where is the door?

296
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,030
How will one return?

297
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,720
The door is just there!

298
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,290
What a cretin!

299
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,670
We do not even have the key.

300
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,100
How will it be opened?

301
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,730
Apis… Its pendentive…

302
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,170
It may be

303
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,120
what it is the key of the nest of the Dragons?

304
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,380
I cannot reach it!

305
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,190
You are too small, Apis!

306
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,750
How that?

307
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,010
Well! Let make me!

308
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,150
One is alive?

309
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,150
Ouais, one would say well.

310
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,520
By the way, which had the idea to use a key up there?

311
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:15,950
Hold!

312
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,200
Well that does not have any more importance, one is inside now.

313
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,270
The result is the same one!

314
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,840
But… which is this place?

315
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,720
And do that… you think what of it?

316
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,000
What… is it?

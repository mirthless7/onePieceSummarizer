1
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:30,980
Here are pirates of the desert!

2
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:30,980
The man who saw free

3
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,950
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,940
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,120
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,630
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,930
On the way of Yuba, where the seat of the rebellion is…

8
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,760
Luffy and its friends find themselves confronted with incredible obstacles in the desert.

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,050
Y makes hot…

10
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,240
Water…

11
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,500
I am afflicted, Zoro.

12
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,090
This heat is really too heavy…

13
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,950
Forget that. It is nothing.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,880
Nami-San! Where are you part??

15
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,630
Nami-San is always beautiful, even now!

16
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,100
What is there, Luffy?

17
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
To travel is easier with you, Matsuge!

18
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,450
But you think that the others are well?

19
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,150
They will find us while following our traces in sand.

20
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,390
A TSUNAMIIII!!!!!!!

21
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,860
Hein? What arrives to him?

22
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,770
A TSUNAMI WILL STRIKE US!!!!!

23
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,760
He! What you ace, Luffy?

24
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,600
I knew it. I knew that it was not an good idea.

25
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,100
About what you do speak?

26
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,870
I said to him not to do it, but he said that he was too thirsty,

27
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,430
he thus tore off a cactus which he found on the way.

28
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,660
A cactus?

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,700
Ouais. Just there.

30
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,620
Those which resemble balls.

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
Oh not! Not these!

32
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,590
They are Mezcal cacti!

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,530
They cause hallucinations!

34
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,060
What?!

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,580
It IS TOO LATE!!

36
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,540
ONE IS COOKED!

37
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,930
Very well! I will strike it!!

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,440
I will return the demon from where it comes!

39
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,060
It is not good that!

40
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,080
Anesthetic!

41
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,500
Played well, Chopper!

42
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,310
Then?

43
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,640
Did you see Nami and Vivi?

44
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,980
Luffy?

45
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,110
What?!

46
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,200
Shit.

47
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,460
One is completely lost.

48
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,520
One does not see any more the traces either.

49
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,860
When I think of it, I did not see Ace since an end of time.

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,630
When did it disappear?

51
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,070
It was surely lost all alone.

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,920
I swear you, which empoté brother…

53
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,000
It is we who are lost!

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
And by your fault!

55
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,670
What doesn't go, Usopp?

56
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,070
You did not hear a noise?

57
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,330
A PIRATE BOAT!?

58
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,520
It is…

59
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,760
They have Nami and Vivi! … and the camel.

60
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,870
What?!

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,150
Eh, Luffy!

62
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,930
Wait!

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,060
And there shit, one will have to go too!

64
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,080
Ouais!

65
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,630
IEA!

66
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,310
Aah, I am burst too much.

67
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,260
It was what this noise?

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,500
I would not do that.

69
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,130
Afflicted, guy.

70
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,550
My throat was so dry that I could not say where I went.

71
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,930
If not, you do not have a little water, the guy? Water…

72
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,840
Didn't Eh, come to you to save us?

73
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,290
I just came to have a little from water.

74
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,880
Luffy-San, saves us.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
I believe that they want to eat Matsuge.

76
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,310
One can eat this trick?

77
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,060
We, the pirates of sands of Barbaro, have a thing to say!

78
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,230
To say?

79
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,210
“There is nothing which does not move in this desert and which is not edible.”

80
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,690
I already ate tricks which were by ground!

81
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,690
You soon will have badly to the belly!

82
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,560
Bah, I will pay attention.

83
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,390
Curious kid!

84
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,220
You are rather odd too!

85
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,260
Let us eat!

86
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,920
WHY!?

87
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,290
I am the Captain of these pirates of sands of Barbaro, Barbarosa.

88
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,040
You, isn't this is Luffy?

89
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,040
I excuse myself for the hard treatment which your companions underwent.

90
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,930
You thus said that you were hungry?

91
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,620
Ha! Do not worry you for that!

92
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,960
How you say!

93
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,500
But, Captain…

94
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,940
There is no board on the boat to repair the great chechmate.

95
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,250
And without the great chechmate, we will not have enough power to advance.

96
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,090
It rightly! It rightly!
What does one have to make?

97
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,520
This rate/rhythm, that means that one will die in the middle of this desert!

98
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,400
Ca means that one all will die!

99
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,130
One all will die in the middle of the desert!

100
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,350
Us, pirates of sands, naps all born on board this boat of sands!

101
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,400
And we will die on this pirate boat of sands!

102
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,510
And which thinks of not finishing these days on this boat?

103
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,130
Yes! Yes! We will die on this boat!

104
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,350
We will die on this boat!

105
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,180
It is what the problem?

106
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,420
Yes, if it is our destiny, that it is thus!

107
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,570
We, pirates of sands, will not defy the winds of sands!

108
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,360
I had said to you not to do that.

109
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,090
But if we make the voyage to the oasis of Melias, we will be able to restock ourselves with drink.

110
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,480
Where is this oasis?

111
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,420
I will make a turn there.

112
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,530
Hein? Eh well you see…

113
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,130
The displacement of sands was strange, recently.

114
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,920
They would be too dangerous for a foreigner.

115
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,900
It is my responsibility.
I will do it!

116
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,060
I see! You will do it?

117
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,580
Bring back to us wood in these sledges of sands.

118
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,660
They resemble more boats than with sledges.

119
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,120
Zaba and Rasa will show the way until Melias to you.

120
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,930
Shaved?

121
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,190
Ouais, Rasa is the best navigator of sledges of sands on our boat.

122
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,390
With which want you to make team?

123
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,300
I would be well myself!

124
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,770
Wait two seconds.

125
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,070
According to all that you have just said to us,

126
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,290
it seems that this work will require a certain force.

127
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,110
Perhaps that I should go there with you.

128
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,750
Beautiful throw!

129
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,120
Shaved!

130
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,260
The others seem to be foreigners…

131
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,260
… but you are of this kingdom.

132
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,880
Be perspicacious for you!

133
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,920
You must know a little bit how this sledge of sands functions.

134
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,240
Isn't this?

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,100
Vivi-Chan cannot make such a dangerous thing!

136
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,620
Ouais! It is too hard!

137
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,790
Very well, I come with you.

138
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,870
Thus this trick slips on sand?

139
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,070
How one makes use of it?

140
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,590
I will direct the sledge.

141
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,060
I already did it front.

142
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,950
It is not quite different compared to a boat, not?

143
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,640
You must just draw this trick…

144
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,350
I… I am of return!

145
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,100
STOPPED LOSING YOUR ENERGY TO MAKE IDIOCIES!

146
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,420
Luffy-San, rests there.

147
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,720
I think initially that you must do that…

148
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,280
Good luck.

149
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,010
Zaba, one goes there!

150
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,540
Ouais, Shaved!

151
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,130
Ca occurs super!

152
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,730
If this sledge were borrowed, we would be in Yuba in one nothing time.

153
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,630
The sledges of sands are difficult to control!

154
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,280
It would be difficult to use to make all the way, in any case!

155
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,640
Then how is that made that you can do it?

156
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,240
When I was small,

157
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,640
I was accustomed to using a sledge of sands, I had one in gift of it!

158
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,600
Good, what will one make while waiting?

159
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
If one were made a camel!?

160
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
We adhere!

161
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,020
I joked!

162
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,750
It did not feel that like a joke.

163
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,100
Do He, what you foutez!?

164
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,100
Ho, Shaved! Idles!

165
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,190
Hoooooo, Vivi! One is attracted inside!

166
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,840
They is moving sands!

167
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,780
If we engulf ourselves in sands,
we will never leave from there!

168
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,410
Shaved, you did not go there a little extremely?

169
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,760
If the chance is with them,
they will be left there and they will catch up with us.

170
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,560
You know this girl?

171
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,250
Yes.

172
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
How could I forget it?

173
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,830
You hold out, Vivi!?

174
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,920
At this speed, one will not arrive there!

175
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,710
Not! It is too late!

176
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,610
Vivi, clings!

177
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,630
In spite of its appearance, Luffy always sometimes happens to be left there.

178
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,690
Ouais.

179
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,590
But what worries me more, they are the whims of this desert.

180
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,220
Whims of the desert?

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,550
Yes…

182
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,590
The desert is honest.

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,880
With same a light change of the climate or according to the hearts of people,

184
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,550
its nature can change.

185
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,480
To change according to the heart of people?

186
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,760
What is it that?

187
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,360
Okashira! It is them!

188
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,360
Okashira:Owner - Boss

189
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,450
They arrive!

190
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
Everyone at its station!

191
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,660
Quickly!

192
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,340
You want to put yourself across my way, you too?

193
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,170
Look at to me all that!

194
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,180
Who are they?

195
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,930
It is a band of robbers of the desert.

196
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,690
They survive while stealing us.
A pathetic group.

197
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,530
Nowadays, the country is ready for the war.

198
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,080
They prepare to attack us.

199
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,520
Look at as they are alone!

200
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,790
Today, one will do them!

201
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
Good the guy!

202
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,410
Do not let only one of these jackals escape alive!

203
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,990
Ouais!

204
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,630
Quite known as!

205
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,820
Quite known as!!

206
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,670
Do these types think that they are in a tavern or what?

207
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,100
We live with far in the desert!

208
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,100
Will it choose us, we them pirate Barbarosa or these least that nothing!?

209
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,560
We will fight and let the desert decide our destiny!

210
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,840
Morons! Morons!

211
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,260
There is no chance that the desert chooses you!

212
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,790
It is what that?

213
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,990
Large ball of manure in sight!

214
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,650
Large ball of manure in sight!

215
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,280
Large ball of manure?

216
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
It is what this trick, still?

217
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,210
In fact insects roll a giant ball of manure through the desert.

218
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,710
For a few years, more than 100 people have lost against this ball of manure!

219
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,830
Okashira!

220
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,820
At this speed, it will touch our boat in little time!

221
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,850
Leave the-me!

222
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,760
Thank you, my guests.

223
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,790
I LEAVE YOU IN LIFE FOR THIS TIME!

224
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,170
YOU HAVE CHANCE!

225
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,160
And one applauds well extremely…

226
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,560
Shaved, you exaggerate!

227
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,130
They did not catch up with us!

228
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,580
Let us leave them!

229
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,230
If we still wait and until they do not arrive,

230
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,220
we will know that they were really bad.

231
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,730
They were caught up with!

232
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,600
This room is completely covered with sand.

233
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,530
Formerly, it was a prosperous city.

234
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,910
You were front here?

235
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,190
The people of this city were those…

236
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,740
… which gave me a small sledge of sands like proof of their kindness.

237
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,250
It was strong a long time ago…

238
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,320
When my father the King made the turn of the country,

239
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
I accompanied it and one stopped in this city.

240
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,220
I waited.

241
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,430
The King said that it would return.

242
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,350
“If something arrives at this oasis, I will come to your help.”

243
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,210
“Even a small voice of this country, I will not be unaware of it.”

244
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,540
You!

245
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,350
I recognize you! It was thus you!

246
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,280
Although he said that, he gave up this oasis.

247
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,240
Everyone had to leave.

248
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,230
But in spite of that, I waited here.
I awaited you.

249
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,620
I believed in you.

250
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,220
But… the King never came.

251
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,260
And of course, you either.

252
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,670
But, the same incidents occurred in the entire country.

253
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,530
The King was solicited the every day and tested…

254
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,330
I do not want to hear your excuses!

255
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,460
In the middle of this immense desert, I waited, only!

256
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,270
During this time, I did not distinguish any more to raise it to lay down sun.

257
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,670
Until the day when Barbarosa collected me…

258
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,690
Neither the heat of the sun midday, nor cold after laying down it sun…

259
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,180
I did not feel anything any more.

260
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,890
I was in life, but it was odd.

261
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,640
Only the words of the King resounded in my head.

262
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,080
Even now, I do not include/understand.

263
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,630
They were so painful.

264
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,710
What did I wait on this ground?

265
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,240
What maintained to me in life?

266
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,280
Hatred?

267
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
Anger?

268
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,190
An impossible hope?

269
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,380
What was it?

270
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,790
That it is said to me!

271
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,250
I am sorry…

272
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,310
I am sorry that you had to wait…

273
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,080
I am sorry…

274
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,600
They fled the tail between the legs!

275
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:55,050
Good, sorry but we cannot give food, of water, or wood.

276
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,480
It is hard to be a pirate of sands, not?

277
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,550
All those which live in the desert have the same problems.

278
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,820
A long ago, I thought that the desert belonged to each one.

279
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,460
But when I reconsider there now…

280
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,830
I say myself “Shit, which ridiculous thought!”

281
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,910
I started to think that perhaps it did not belong to no matter whom.

282
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,190
And because it does not belong to anybody, we can really live freely.

283
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,630
I wonder whether it is similar for the sea.

284
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,050
Perhaps…

285
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,770
You and your band will have to discover it by yourselves.

286
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,240
I see them! We are of return!

287
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,110
LUFFY!

288
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,800
OR ES YOU?

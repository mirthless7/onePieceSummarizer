1
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,344
Foolish pirates...

2
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:11,722
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

3
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:16,935
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

4
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:17,060
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

5
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,185
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

6
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:17,686
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

7
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:17,769
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

8
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:17,894
You still dare to attack the Going Merry knowing
it's led by the great Captain Usopp?!

9
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:22,190
A violent battle ensues!

10
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:34,286
Hey, can't you guys...

11
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:35,078
pay some attention to people?

12
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:35,162
pay some attention to people?

13
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:36,705
pay some attention to people?

14
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:37,873
IT'S DONE!

15
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,335
Look, it's our pirate flag!

16
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:44,421
After Usopp joined us, we now have 4 people.

17
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:46,673
So we need our own mark.

18
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:50,218
That is... our mark?

19
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,180
What do you think? Nice isn't it.

20
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:57,517
A pirate's flag is a symbol of death and terror.

21
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:57,768
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

22
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:57,851
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

23
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:58,143
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

24
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:58,560
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,935
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

26
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,021
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

27
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:01,271
I do feel the terror, but it's the terror of your talent.

28
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,275
You should have discussed it with me first.

29
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,820
How can you forget this genius painter?

30
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:10,197
Genius painter?

31
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:13,492
I've had 50 years of experience painting on walls.

32
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:16,119
When it comes to painting, no
one does it better than me.

33
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,455
Incredible, 50 years!

34
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:20,916
That means... you are an old man!

35
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,751
Maybe he has 5 or 6 grandchildren already.

36
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,460
Maybe he has 5 or 6 grandchildren already.

37
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,087
That's even more incredible!

38
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:25,837
Hey!

39
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:29,341
Now, take a look at this masterpiece.

40
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:29,716
Now, take a look at this masterpiece.

41
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,010
Now, take a look at this masterpiece.

42
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,344
Tada!

43
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:32,386
Tada!

44
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,303
Tada!

45
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:36,098
Who told you to make your own flag?!

46
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,311
Well, I guess it's something like this.

47
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:43,438
Eh, this is pretty good.

48
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,440
That's good, I like it.

49
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,610
So this is our mark from now on eh.

50
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:51,863
Okay... Usopp, paint this on the sail!

51
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,536
Okay, it's finished!

52
00:03:59,204 --> 00:03:59,663
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

53
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:00,122
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

54
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:00,163
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

55
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:00,372
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

56
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:00,414
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

57
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:00,914
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

58
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:01,039
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

59
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,540
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

60
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:01,707
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

61
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:01,748
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

62
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:01,790
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

63
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,165
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

64
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:02,290
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

65
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:02,457
Now the pirate ship Going Merry is complete!

66
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:14,622
YOU ARE A SPECIAL ANIMAL!
GAIMON AND HIS WONDERFUL FRIENDS

67
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:18,557
I'm exhausted!

68
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:24,980
Is this direction alright?

69
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,648
It doesn't look too good.

70
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:28,317
What?

71
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:29,401
Wait.

72
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:34,197
That is it! That's it, there's no doubt about it.

73
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:34,239
That is it! That's it, there's no doubt about it.

74
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,449
That is it! That's it, there's no doubt about it.

75
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:36,199
Did you see something?

76
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,241
Did you see something?

77
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,034
Did you see something?

78
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,327
Something interesting?

79
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,038
That's the legendary treasure island.

80
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:41,079
That's the legendary treasure island.

81
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:42,789
Legendary Treasure Island?

82
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:44,374
I've heard about it.

83
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:44,875
Yes, it's an island famous among pirates.

84
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,125

Could the legend be true? Is this God's anger?

117
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:07,230
This somehow seems interesting!

118
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,857
Eh, Luffy don't tell me...

119
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,317
It's what you're thinking!

120
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,991
Let's go, to the treasure island!

121
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,369
But... this island sure is strange.

122
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,370
Is it?

123
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,373
It's said that there's unimaginable treasure
somewhere on this island.

124
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:06,415
It's said that there's unimaginable treasure

135
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:09,710
Many pirates have come here before...

136
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:09,918
Many pirates have come here before...

137
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:09,960
Many pirates have come here before...

138
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,085

139
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:10,252

Many pirates have come here before...

147
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,633
But before any of them could find the
treasure, they were scared away.

148
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,094
Huh? Scared away?

149
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:23,307
For example, some pirates would just suddenly
turn into a boar in the middle of the night.

150
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,434
For example, some pirates would just suddenly
turn into a boar in the middle of the night.

For example, some pirates would just suddenly
turn into a boar in the middle of the night.

152
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:28,228
There was one guy whose mustache
grew longer and longer...

153
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:28,353
There was one guy whose mustache
grew longer and longer...

154
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:28,520
and finally like a snake it choked him to death.

155
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,687
and finally like a snake it choked him to death.

156
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,355
and finally like a snake it choked him to death.

157
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:30,981
and finally like a snake it choked him to death.

158
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,106
and finally like a snake it choked him to death.

159
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:31,231
and finally like a snake it choked him to death.

160
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,400
You're lying right?

161
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:37,195
I'm just telling you the most
exaggerated stories though.

162
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,489
Don't scare me like that!

163
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:48,623
I'm hungry.

164
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm going to sleep.

165
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:53,211
How can you sleep in such a strange place.

166
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:53,420
How can you sleep in such a strange place.

167
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,462

How can you sleep in such a strange place.

175
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:54,463
How can you sleep in such a strange place.

176
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,380
How can you sleep in such a strange place.

177
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,464
How can you sleep in such a strange place.

178
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:55,714
Really! What kind of nerves does he have?

179
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:55,881
Really! What kind of nerves does he have?

180
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,131
Really! What kind of nerves does he have?

181
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:56,298
Really! What kind of nerves does he have?

182
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:57,716
Really! What kind of nerves does he have?

183
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,521
What the hell? Don't scare me!

184
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:15,067
I just wanted to dance a little
to lighten up the atmosphere.

185
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:22,574
Stop that... Luffy.

186
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,668
This... this is...

187
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:38,840
Get out of here!

188
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:40,592
Who's there?

189
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,094
Get out of here!

190
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:44,262
Where is that voice coming from?

191
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,891
I am the Guardian God of this island.

192
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,978
If you want to save your lives
leave this island immediately.

193
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:52,771
Guardian God?

194
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:55,107
Aren't you guys pirates?

195
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:55,857
That's right.

196
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,609
I knew you were pirates.

197
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,779
Why would a god need to ask that?

198
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,616
Listen, if you take one more step into that forest...

199
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:10,664
you will have to face God's judgment.
Do you really want that?

200
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:13,458
Like I care, why are you asking me this?

201
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,835
What the hell is this?

202
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,169
This guy is weird.

203
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,588
What did you say, straw hat boy?

204
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,347
What the hell is this?

205
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:29,850
All humans that come for the treasure...

206
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:32,936
this is their form after being transformed by me.

207
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,732
That means you really are God?

208
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,526
There sure are a lot of strange things here.

209
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,528
ls this a lion?

210
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,113
lsn't it a pig.

211
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,870
Wh... what the hell are you?

212
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,496
l'm a rubber man.

213
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,123
I ate the Devil's fruit.

214
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,667
The Devil's fruit? That's impossible!

215
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,503
Back when I was a pirate, I'd heard rumors...

216
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,088
When you were a pirate?

217
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,592
N... no way, I'm not reminiscing about the past.

218
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:06,261
I don't want to hear about the past.

219
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,972
What are you saying? You're the one who's talking.

220
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,391
You! Are you really a God?

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,351
Shut up!

222
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,728
If your not leaving, then face God's Judgment!

223
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,822
Now you did it, God.

224
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:27,449
Wh... why are you still ok?

225
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:28,568
Over there!

226
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,368
Don't move!

227
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,495
I told you not to move!

228
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,293
That's impossible!

229
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,670
Hey, God...

230
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,255
A pistol is useless against him.

231
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,049
But I don't like being surprised!

232
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,510
Mon... monster!

233
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:48,095
There!

234
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,973
This is a pistol.

235
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:01,274
Where did he go?

236
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:07,489
What is this?

237
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,491
This is... God?

238
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:12,494
It's moving!

239
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,007
Hurry and help me up! Help me up!

240
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:26,091
He's human.

241
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,427
Interesting, is it a bush?

242
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:32,597
Where does he resemble God? Trying to fool us.

243
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,058
Shut up! Help me up!

244
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:37,102
Don't get so angry.

245
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:40,063
I'll forgive you today!

246
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:41,398
Wait!

247
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:57,122
Luffy!
Hey Luffy!

248
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:15,349
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

249
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,397
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

250
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,821
Right! That'll be fine now.

251
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:37,037
You're pretty popular, God.

252
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:42,876
Untill now you were using them to scare away
those who came to the island, right?

253
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,505
But this is the first time I've seen
a man who lives in a box.

254
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,173
Are you a ''boxed son?''

255
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:51,718
Yeah. Since I was little because
I was a precious little master...

256
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,345
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

257
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,139
I can't even get out of this box.

258
00:11:56,178 --> 00:12:01,061
I have lived stuck in this box for
20 years already, all alone.

259
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:02,771
20 years!?

260
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,657
You've been on this island alone for 20 years?

261
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,761
Look at how my hair and beard have grown.

262
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,786
Even my eyebrows have joined.

263
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:21,248
And its been 20 years since I've spoken to people.

264
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:23,875
Do you understand my position?

265
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:25,919
Why? Idiot.

266
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,504
What do you mean idiot?!

267
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,925
What the? You were all over here?

268
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:35,679
You! Even with all the commotion
you were able to sleep until now?

269
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:47,065
What's with this guy?

270
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,817
Notice sooner...

271
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,652
He is a human that lives in a box

272
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,071
Are you a ''boxed son?''

273
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:56,366
Yeah. Since I was little because I
was the precious little master...

274
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,909
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

275
00:12:58,035 --> 00:12:59,995
Don't tell me such stupidly pointless jokes again...

276
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,246
Zoro, lend me a hand.

277
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,707
Ow! Ow! What are you doing?

278
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,668
Stop it! My neck will break!

279
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:09,838
Its true. You can't come out.

280
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,214
Don't be reckless!

281
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,634
After years inside

282
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:16,720
my body has fit into this treasure box perfectly.

283
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,431
If you break the box my body
would be done for too.

284
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,224
What a chatter-box.

285
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,228
But, who are you guys?

286
00:13:25,395 --> 00:13:28,815
There's something different compared
to the pirates that came previously.

287
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:30,901
I'm Luffy.

288
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:32,903
The man who will become pirate king.

289
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:34,363
Wh-what??

290
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,658
I'm going to become the pirate
king and get One Piece.

291
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,660
One Piece you say?

292
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,871
Your not really planning to go
to the Grand Line are you?

293
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,831
We even have a map to the Grand Line.

294
00:13:45,832 --> 00:13:47,584
Don't underestimate it.

295
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:50,045
That place is the hell's coffin.

296
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:54,758
I have seen pirates that escaped
from the Grand Line.

297
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:58,345
They were spiritless like the undead.

298
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,931
Whether something horrible happened to them,

299
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,808
or whether they met terrible monsters.

300
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,852
Not one person was able to say anything.

301
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:10,193
Beyond that, there are so many
rumors about One Piece

302
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:12,859
that no one knows the truth anymore.

303
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:16,154
The great pirate era has already lasted 20 years.

304
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,575
One Piece is no longer a mere legend
but a dream in a dream.

305
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:26,039
And where is the Grand Line?

306
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:28,834
Who knows. Don't you know Bush-ossan?

307
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,086
I don't understand maps at all.

308
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,713
What the... we're the same.

309
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,883
Is this how pirates talk amongst themselves?

310
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:39,845
Anyway if we get to the Grand Line,

311
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,515
we will get as much as possible and
then get away as soon as possible.

312
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:46,643
I'm sure we'll find the One Piece. I have good luck.

313
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,313
Where do you get so much confidence from.

314
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,940
I'll definitely find it and show you.

315
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,692
I give up.

316
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,529
You do resemble...

317
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:02,367
Your face resembles mine, like a twin.

318
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,494
Where is the resemblance?

319
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,217
I knew it!

320
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:10,792
That one day our dreams would come true. We
were always that way since the beginning.

321
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:12,294
We?

322
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,839
In order to find treasure, losing
your life doesn't matter.

323
00:15:15,943 --> 00:15:19,676
It was that passion that changed my life.

324
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,428
Wa... Wait, what are you talking about?

325
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:21,762
It was 20 years ago.

326
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:22,638
It was 20 years ago.

327
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:27,309
I landed along with my companions
on this island as a pirate.

328
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,230
We came to find the treasure that lay on this island.

329
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,110
200 of us have searched for a
month already. It's all in vain

330
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,613
200 of us have searched for a
month already. It's all in vain

331
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:40,072
200 of us have searched for a
month already. It's all in vain

332
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,825
The only thing on this island is this one empty box.

333
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:45,702
Lets go, comrades!

334
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,541
Whats up Gaimon? I'm going ahead of you.

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,501
Okay.

336
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:56,630
Up there...

337
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,382
Did anybody search there?

338
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,093
Though the Captain searched
this island for a month...

339
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,264
I'll check it one last time.

340
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,065
I couldn't believe my eyes.

341
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,735
I found it. At the top!

342
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:20,946
Hey everyone!

343
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,125
That was when I got stuck in the box.

344
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:38,296
When I came to, my companions had already set sail

345
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,133
They left me behind!

346
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:43,635
Wait a minute.

347
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:47,431
That means all that treasure is only mine now.

348
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,642
I can't climb up like this!

349
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:54,104
Can't get out! I can't get out!

350
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:59,818
Hey! Come back!

351
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,611
For all the years since then.

352
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:06,742
That one glance at the treasure hasn't left my mind.

353
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:10,329
So when Pirates come to this
island in search of treasure...

354
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,540
I used these guys and scare them away.

355
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:18,545
In this manner for 20 years
I have guarded the treasure.

356
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,089
They are mine!

357
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,009
There's no doubt about it. They're yours.

358
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,927
Gaimon-san, I understand.

359
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,096
I'll help you get those treasures.

360
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:28,472
I'll help you get those treasures.

361
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:28,764
I'll help you get those treasures.

362
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,433
Really?

363
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:33,602
Could it be...

364
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,229
You're a thief of pirates aren't you?

365
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:38,273
You! That's rude!

366
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,901
Even I get emotionally moved.

367
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,093
Here huh?

368
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,096
I haven't been here in a long time...

369
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,270
Finally the time has come!

370
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,730
Today's a good day!

371
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,190
I'm counting on you, Straw-hat!

372
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:20,816
Okay!

373
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,108
GOMU GOMU NO...

374
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:21,191
GOMU GOMU NO...

375
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:21,233
GOMU GOMU NO...

376
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,275
GOMU GOMU NO...

377
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:22,651
GOMU GOMU NO...

378
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:27,280
ROCKET!

379
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,073
ROCKET!

380
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:28,865
ROCKET!

381
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,203
Alright!

382
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:41,294
How is it? Do you see it?

383
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:46,174
What is he doing?

384
00:18:46,883 --> 00:18:49,553
Luffy?

385
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:51,555
What's happening?

386
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,144
I've got it. Five treasure boxes!

387
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,645
Go..Got it!

388
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:04,234
Finally I've got the treasure! Treasure!

389
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:08,322
Can you bring them down? My treasure?

390
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:09,865
Hurry! Hurry!

391
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:10,449
No!

392
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:10,490
No!

393
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:11,450
What?

394
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,787
I said no. I don't want to give them to you.

395
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:19,207
What nonsense are you saying? Stop joking.

396
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,920
Yeah! Those treasures are Gaimon's!

397
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,129
Hand them all over!

398
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:31,303
You, stop this nonsense!

399
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:31,428
It's okay.

400
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:32,137
It's okay.

401
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,098
It's okay.

402
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:36,433
It's not okay!

403
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,142
That's right!

404
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,312
You've guarded that treasure for 20 years.

405
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,273
Straw-hat, you're...

406
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,151
You're really a nice guy!

407
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:48,362
What do you mean?

408
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,991
I thought of it before.
That maybe...

409
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:56,620
Even though its unbearable to think it.

410
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:00,374
There's nothing inside, is there?

411
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,961
Yeah. They're all empty.

412
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:10,801
No way... the treasures you've guarded
for 20 years... are only empty boxes...

413
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:15,597
Its something that happens often with treasures.

414
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,976
Sometimes reach them after the
treasures have been taken.

415
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,938
So... searching for treasure is a trial for pirates.

416
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:26,024
Wasting a life time, sacrificing your own life,

417
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,693
only to get nothing at the end.

418
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,987
There are many pirates like that.

419
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:35,158
Don't be so sad, ossan!

420
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,828
Good thing we got here in the 20th year.

421
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:40,622
If no one came in another 30 years
you could have wound up dead.

422
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,125
Straw hat...

423
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,167
Luffy.

424
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,460
That guy...

425
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,254
You just got sidetracked by this.

426
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,548
Now all that's left is One Piece.

427
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,342
Become a pirate with us once more!

428
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,054
You! Are you inviting me?

429
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:02,269
Till now there was no one who would
talk to me after seeing my condition.

430
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,522
I don't know how long it's been
since I've trusted someone.

431
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:14,197
Thank you!

432
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,295
Are you really going to stay on this island, ossan?

433
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,088
Yeah Straw-hat.

434
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,009
Even if there are no treasures, there
are other things for me to protect.

435
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,762
Things to protect?

436
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:42,392
I have lived with these guys for 20 years
through hard times and happy times.

437
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:44,478
I can't just leave them.

438
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,948
Knowing there's no treasure
I feel free for the first time.

439
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:00,369
From now I'd like to live my life the way I want.

440
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:03,538
In reality I've begun to enjoy living in a box.

441
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,917
I see! That's too bad
Because Ossan's so interesting!

442
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,336
The strange creatures are your
true companions huh?

443
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:12,130
Though ossan is the strangest.

444
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,674
What did you say?!

445
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,436
See you! Take care!

446
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,146
Goodbye!

447
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:32,609
Straw-hat!

448
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,071
Word hard towards your dreams in my place!

449
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:37,906
If its you, then I'm sure you'll get it.

450
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:38,657
If its you, then I'm sure you'll get it.

451
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,074
If its you, then I'm sure you'll get it.

452
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:42,452
The legendary treasure One Piece!

453
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:49,960
Then... you should buy the whole world!

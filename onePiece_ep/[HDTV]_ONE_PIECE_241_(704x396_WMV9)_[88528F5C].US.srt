1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,440
This odor…

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,330
But it is…

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,330
Chopper, that is there?

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,860
Oi, Chopper!

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,610
Oi, Chopper, that go?!

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,370
Is Oi, Comment that?

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,270
You hurt yourself?

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,010
What is there? You start to run of a blow and… and…

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,290
I was sure. It is there.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,590
Robin!

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,530
I did not come to join you.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,160
They is here that our ways separate, in this city.

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,130
I carry in me this “darkness” that none you knows.

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,330
This darkness will destroy you, one day.

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,850
In the beginning, I am supposed to make you accuse and flee.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,529
The things will be worsened for you.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,749
Robin-chan! I do not include/understand anything so that you say!

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,869
That there is?!

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,960
Robin! Let us return together!

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,440
One all got along well, but from today…

21
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,740
We will not be re-examined any more.

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,280
Thank you to have been so nice with me until now.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,280
Goodbye.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,410
Wait…

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,160
Wait!

26
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,930
I cannot accept that.

27
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,180
WAIT!

28
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,010
Stop your conneries!

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,310
Wait, Robin-chan!

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,450
ROBIN!

31
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,779
It was lost.

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,020
Ouais.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,270
Chopper…

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,670
Join Luffy and the others, will tell them what it occurred.

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,150
All in detail.

36
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,289
And you?

37
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,220
I will try something of other.

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,720
Do not worry you, I will remain careful.

39
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:56,600
To catch Robin!
The decision of the crew of the Straw hat.

40
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,139
Wait!

41
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
Do not let them escape!

42
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,729
What you ace foutu!?

43
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,929
It was inevitable!

44
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,979
How I could hide me? They are too numerous!

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,030
You will not escape!

46
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,650
By there!

47
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,220
By there!

48
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,529
What? Where are parties?

49
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,040
Seek everywhere!

50
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,879
Nothing in the lane?

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,340
Are they assembled on the roofs?

52
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,370
Shit, they are make the trunk!

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,349
Good, they had to leave in this direction.

54
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,789
Do you have to seek by over there?

55
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,959
Then let us check inside the buildings!

56
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,709
Yosh!

57
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,700
One separate in two groups!

58
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,349
It is good now?

59
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,780
Not yet.

60
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,120
They disappeared by here!

61
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,510
And now?

62
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,310
Still a little.

63
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,350
Please.

64
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,809
Not now. We leave to put ourselves at the shelter!

65
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,380
Stop insisting!

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,710
Please. I have money.

67
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,419
In exchange, I need boards. Like a little tar and ropes.

68
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,029
And then nails, locks and outcry.

69
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,170
I will close the store.

70
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,790
Excuse me, but…

71
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,119
Good, but you will not be able all to have with this sum.

72
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,719
A-Alors, do you accept tools in the place of the money which misses?

73
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,099
Oi, oi, would not be stupid. Stop.

74
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,679
I make only the sale.

75
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,300
It is what these chicaneries? From which area do come you?

76
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,530
Good, then I do not have the choice.

77
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,810
Will O-Oi, you leave itself there with all your wounds?

78
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,669
You do not have companions who can help you?!

79
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,660
Oi!

80
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,030
Here, I had said to you!

81
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,800
Oi, wait a little, kid!

82
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,419
They is good. I manage very well.

83
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,289
Oi!

84
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,389
It is what? I do not need your aid…

85
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,430
Not. Here, take that.

86
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,190
You hungry, isn't this is?

87
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,450
Thank you.

88
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,230
Would be careful.

89
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,520
Would be careful!

90
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,690
Delicious!

91
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,820
They is really good.

92
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,120
This old man was really simpa.

93
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,550
The waves increased volume.

94
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,630
Do not make any you, all is well.

95
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,720
You are the boat which ace stolen in the airs.

96
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,010
Do not make any you!

97
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,940
What is there still?

98
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,820
What is there, Franky?

99
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,840
Aniki?

100
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,049
Whore, I am irritated!

101
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,230
It is the moment for any Peter!

102
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,750
Aniki, await us!

103
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,840
Thank you for the meal, Blueno.

104
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,460
It is what the problem, Kokoro-san? Why did Franky leave so quickly?

105
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,789
Who knows. I do not know…

106
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,020
...com lies function the cretins.

107
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,339
Ca was finally calmed.

108
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,020
Calmed?

109
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,980
If you had not been done driven out by the carpenters, one would not have been made locate!

110
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,190
I said to you that it was inevitable.

111
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,549
Moreover, Chopper. How you have to find us?

112
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,629
With the odor.

113
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,329
Ah, played well.

114
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,680
Is Heu, where Sanji?

115
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,680
On this subject…

116
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,470
ROBIN REALLY SAID THAT?!

117
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,370
One could expect it.

118
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,500
One left Robin, formerly our enemy,
to go up on board boat.

119
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,170
It realized that they was too dangerous and east flees.

120
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,690
Isn't this the moment to have the heart Net of it?

121
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,640
If this woman is our enemy…

122
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,440
Or our friend.

123
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:31,490
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

124
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,359
The things will be worsened for you. Henceforth…

125
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,830
We will not be re-examined any more.

126
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,770
If I remember well, it is what said Robin, isn't this Chopper?

127
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,300
Since we will not re-examine it any more…

128
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,100
She says that as if something of low register were going to arrive to us.

129
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,250
If it intends to make a thing of worse in this city…

130
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,950
Considering the panic created by the attempted murder of the mayor, there remains only one option.

131
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,390
To assassinate the mayor, at sure cost this time.

132
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,700
Ca appears obvious.

133
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,710
But now that we know that she wants to make us wear the hat…

134
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,610
It is perhaps only one trap to attract us on the spot of the crime.

135
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
A trap?

136
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,530
If we are in trimmings at the time of the crime, we will be definitively marked.

137
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,980
He!

138
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,870
You say that as if Robin were our enemy!

139
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,269
I say just that it is possible.

140
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,350
I do not have an opinion.

141
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,169
To believe or doubt, if I lean on a side…

142
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,430
My reaction time is affected…

143
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,040
If my spirit thinks the reverse of my choice.

144
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,469
If something occurs, it will be this evening. One goes there?

145
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,690
One goes there.

146
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,120
It does not matter if one goes there…

147
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,150
Isn't the problem, it is that Sanji saw Robin going with a person?

148
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,160
And Iceberg saw it too.

149
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,229
“It was accompanied by a masked person.”

150
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,020
It is none among us.

151
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,280
It is because of him that Robin suddenly changed.

152
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,389
It makes make dirty tricks with Robin!

153
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,350
Ca holds upright.

154
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,230
But the worst would be than Robin and are to him partners.

155
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,549
We do not have any index on that which hides behind this mask.

156
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,219
It is the problem.

157
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,270
Which is our goal?

158
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,460
To catch Robin.

159
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,630
It is the only means of more.

160
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,990
It is true, one wastes time to reflect. But…

161
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,960
To find a woman whom the government did not succeed in catching in twenty years seems difficult.

162
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,950
But it is the only way of knowing the truth.

163
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,940
Yosh, I will do my better, me too.

164
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,060
Then, let us go in Galley it Company.

165
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,350
Shit. The sun lay down.

166
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,069
Paulie-san, that fears!

167
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,620
The low city is too dangerous now!

168
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,829
Ouais, let us drop. I return to the office.

169
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,130
Included/understood!

170
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,100
Oi, the guy! One gives up!

171
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,170
STRAW HAT! SHOW YOURSELF!

172
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,190
WHERE ES YOU?!

173
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,149
STRAW HAT!

174
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,440
This dumb is malignant…

175
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,660
But it will not be shown.

176
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,940
Aniki, they are pursued in all the island.

177
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,440
Yes, they are surely already far.

178
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,619
Is He, it what the problem? What you ridges?

179
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,410
We are too sensitive…

180
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,350
Vis-a-vis the wind.

181
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,080
Aniki, you act bizarement today.

182
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,829
You forget that there remains to you money.

183
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,679
The farm! I am like that all the time.

184
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,909
Aha! Aniki!

185
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,600
It is Zambai and the others.

186
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,379
Aniki, do you have to crush them?

187
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,609
Not, not yet. I had unforeseen, then they are flee.

188
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,939
What?!

189
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,309
They have escaped with the anger of Aniki?!

190
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,060
They had much chance.

191
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,289
I see. But the dead loss with the long nose repaired the all alone boat…

192
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,010
Then it was thought that Aniki had overcome them.

193
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,410
You know where I can find one of them?

194
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,720
Yes, with the boat.

195
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,530
If there remains one about it, all becomes easier.

196
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,930
One will make use of it to trap the others.

197
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,570
The face of Aniki is terrifying.

198
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,920
The guy, you in all the city move while howling

199
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,170
“We have the length-nose!”

200
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,699
“If you do not want to see it running at the ocean floor, go to the warehouse, under the bridge!”

201
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,230
“On behalf of Franky”.

202
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,649
And now, I go choper length-nose.

203
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,250
Of agreement, Aniki! Trust us!

204
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,199
It is what? You are enormous, but your luggage too.

205
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,790
It is a floating bed.

206
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:40,500
Aqua Laguna, Aqua Laguna, Aqua Laguna arrive!

207
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,910
It is Aqua Laguna!

208
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,569
News on the criminals?

209
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,149
It would seem that they are always in freedom.

210
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,149
It is what one said to me. I do not like that.

211
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,589
People say that they will benefit from the storm to tackle this evening again.

212
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,310
Aqua Laguna is there!

213
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,310
All will be well this evening. The craftsmen of Galley will protect it the fortress.

214
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,579
It is not to take with the light one.

215
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,030
At how much pirates is estimated the crew of Straw hat?

216
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,050
Some say 50, others say 100.

217
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,829
After all, the setting at price of the captain is of 100 million.

218
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,149
Perhaps that 3000 men will emerge from the ocean this evening?!

219
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,640
It is madness!

220
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,910
Open the eye, do not leave any opening, Galley it Company!

221
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,460
Do not let even a mouse enter!

222
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,979
APPROACH IF YOU DARE!

223
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,170
You shout too extremely! Calm remainder, Tileston!

224
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,320
They did not take the train of the sea.

225
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,460
Then they are always on the island.

226
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,100
It would be necessary to be insane to try to penetrate this surprotégé place.

227
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,010
I heard that this idiot came here head lowered in full day.

228
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,540
There is no more logic.

229
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,910
Maaa…

230
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,100
They did not need to do all that.

231
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,760
They all are voluntary…

232
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,110
I have the impression to be a king.

233
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,290
Another thing Iceberg-san, why do you have the research opinion of Nico Robin in your room?

234
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,260
Does Ca disturb you?

235
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,600
A little.

236
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,390
It is preferable that you would not be with the current.

237
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,230
It is…

238
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,690
A demon.

239
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,460
Guards of everywhere.

240
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,329
It is too far.

241
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,379
You will not have that to lengthen your arms until over there if there is grabuge.

242
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,120
Yes, if we act initially, they would benefit from it.

243
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,920
Attention, be attentive with the least movement!

1
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,880
The ocean which recovers the world

2
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,930
is divided into two by a continent called Red Line.

3
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:08,270
The current which makes the round the world tour calls Grand Line.

4
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,940
Gold Roger, the Lord of the Pirates, hid there

5
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,000
its treasure, One Part,

6
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,360
some share on this road.

7
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,800
Since, pirates ventured at sea.

8
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,170
It is one enthralling time.

9
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,560
The pirates make float their emblems.

10
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,670
It is at that time

11
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,790
that we become acquainted with a young pirate,

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,260
of which here adventures.

13
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,750
Go…

14
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,230
Shanks, takes me along with you when you set out again at sea.

15
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,640
I want to become too a pirate me.

16
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,570
Why?

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960
Why not?

18
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,200
Luffy, even if you could swim very well,

19
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,600
you could not become pirate.

20
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,200
I can fight too.

21
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,500
My fist is as powerful as a ball of revolver.

22
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,820
Ouais, it is that…

23
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,430
Stop making fun you!

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,270
Luffy still likes the toys.

25
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,630
At his age, I did not leave the house, me.

26
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,940
I am not any more one kid, I am an adult!

27
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,290
Calm yourself, thus take a fruit juice.

28
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,100
Thank you.

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,610
And you say that you are adult?

30
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,620
Te insane step of me, Shanks!

31
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,820
Afflicted to disturb you.

32
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,950
Look at to me this band of goods to nothing.

33
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,930
We are gangsters of the mountains.

34
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,760
But did not fear, us did not come to plunder the city.

35
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,770
We came to seek rum.

36
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,440
I am afflicted, but there does not remain to me any more rum.

37
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,520
It is strange, these pirates are however drinking some.

38
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,090
I served the last barrel to them.

39
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,980
Really afflicted, but one very drank.

40
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,750
Afflicted.

41
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,580
I give you this bottle if you want, it was not open yet.

42
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,510
My head is put at price to 8 million Berrys,

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,780
this bottle will not seal my thirst.

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,000
Ah it, the ground is soaked now.

45
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,340
I am afflicted, Makino-san.

46
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,220
You have a sponge?

47
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,330
I will do it.

48
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,850
You like to do the housework, one would say.

49
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,620
Then deals with that too.

50
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,250
We do not have anything to make here,

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,500
one from goes away.

52
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,850
Goodbye, band of idiots.

53
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,990
What took to you, Capitaine!

54
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,390
You were made ridicule!

55
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,230
How can you laugh?

56
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,120
Why didn't you fight?

57
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,210
Even if they were more numerous…

58
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,820
Which kind of men are you, to laugh when one humiliates you?

59
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,170
You are not pirates!!

60
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,110
I include/understand what you feel,

61
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,170
but it is only rum.

62
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,970
Useless to be irritated for that.

63
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
I cause you more!

64
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,730
In this moment, I had believed that Shanks was a coward.

65
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,720
But in fact,

66
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,490
I had not included/understood the way of acting of Shanks,

67
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,330
for this drink history.

68
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,390
What do you want?

69
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,950
Are Oh, you in anger because of what I said?

70
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,670
Yes, I require excuse!

71
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,150
You will regret it. Goes in hell!

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,340
Luffy!

73
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,320
Save it!

74
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,270
I suspected well that it occurred something.

75
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,830
Then they are still these gangsters of the mountains.

76
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,730
Captain.

77
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,600
Luffy.

78
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,310
Isn't your fist as powerful as a ball of revolver?

79
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,380
The farm!

80
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,110
I advise you to leave before somebody is not wounded.

81
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,980
If you still approach, I explode you the head, species of coward.

82
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,770
I said to you not to approach more, if not I make you jump the brain.

83
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,200
It is a bet.

84
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,110
I say that the gun is a bet on the life.

85
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,240
What do you tell?

86
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,020
I say simply that a gun is not made for bluffer.

87
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,690
You killed it!

88
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,640
Species of dumbs.

89
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,610
Us?

90
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,240
Stop saying stupid things.

91
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,980
You really believed that you had gained?

92
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,850
We are pirates, you know.

93
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,530
Listen to me well, the gangsters.

94
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,010
Whether you sprinkle me rum, or spit on my hat,

95
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,360
I can laugh at it.

96
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,500
But…

97
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,440
If you dare to carry the hand on my friends…

98
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,190
Shanks.

99
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,160
I occupy myself some.

100
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,460
Do not underestimate us, gangsters!

101
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,820
If you hope to beat us one day, come with an army!

102
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,220
Super…

103
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,170
Good-bye.

104
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,610
Shit, I did not even can card-index a punch with this dead loss to him.

105
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,450
Shit!

106
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,330
I am sorry, but you are useless for me now.

107
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Release!

108
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,850
We are grateful to you, Luffy.

109
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,510
Makino warned us,

110
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,270
it is for that we came to beat us.

111
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,630
He, does not cry, you are a man!

112
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,580
But Shanks… your arm!!

113
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,080
My arm does not have importance,

114
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,370
since you are in life.

115
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,940
Shanks refused at sea to take it along with him,

116
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,220
because of its brittleness

117
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,900
and of its lack of force.

118
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
But Luffy had seen its size,

119
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,550
and it decided to become like him.

120
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,500
You leave?

121
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,470
Yes.

122
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,860
We remained a long time here. You only will feel?

123
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,670
Yes, but I will not wonder any more to take myself along with you.

124
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,710
I will arrive there all alone, with becoming pirate.

125
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,020
In any event, I will not have taken to you with me.

126
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,790
You believe yourself able to become pirate all alone?

127
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,660
Obviously!!

128
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,620
One day, I will gather an invincible crew

129
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,860
and I will find all the largest treasures of the world!

130
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,600
AND I WILL BECOME THE LORD OF THE PIRATES!

131
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,060
You want to become stronger than us?

132
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,310
In this case…

133
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,770
I entrust my hat to you.

134
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,550
This hat is very invaluable for me, then take in care!

135
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,840
One day, I will recover it.

136
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,640
Hold your promise.

137
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,300
I count on you, Luffy.

138
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,740
The adventure begins one decade later.

139
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,540
I slept well!!

140
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,750
Go!

141
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,030
Show them what the crew of Arbyda is able!

142
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,990
I am called Monkey D. Luffy. Enchanted!

143
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,500
They is super good.

144
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,710
One is on a pirate boat?

145
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,090
Not, not that one.

146
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,160
It is a boat which Arbyda-Sama wants to plunder.

147
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,310
They is good.

148
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,770
There is no canot de sauvetage here?

149
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,220
If, undoubtedly.

150
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,830
Mine was taken in a swirl.

151
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,880
A swirl? And you are always in life?

152
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,690
Ouais, I am astonished myself by me to be left about it.

153
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,070
Kobby, that made a long time.

154
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,600
Is it well?

155
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I do not know.

156
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,820
But such as it is, it must work very hard.

157
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,770
I do not arrive at knowing if it is simply timid or obstinate.

158
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,630
You do not have any will?

159
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,260
You are the kind of anybody whom I hate!

160
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,340
Allow me

161
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,920
to enlist me in the Navy, please!

162
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,950
I drive myself station that you will give me, I am ready with all.

163
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,060
I want to enter the Navy!

164
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,110
Many sailors were killed by pirates.

165
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
It is not part of pleasure.

166
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,500
Then…

167
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,210
I accept your request!

168
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,410
Yes!

169
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,200
So long, Kobby!

170
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,960
Keep with you!

171
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,040
You have chance to have a friend like him.

172
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,640
Yes!

173
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,430
Do not make any you for him, Kobby has notch.

174
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,200
That will go.

175
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,780
One day…

176
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,070
One day one will be re-examined, Luffy-San.

177
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,130
In spite of what opposes a pirate and a guy of the Navy.

178
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,250
Then thus did that occur?

179
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,900
Nami?

180
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,060
It is really not believable.

181
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,380
Ouais.

182
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,670
I always took care on Zoro and you.

183
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,040
What?

184
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,200
I detach you if you unite with me.

185
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
What?

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
I seek companions to train my crew of pirates.

187
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,740
I refuse!

188
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
You want that I unite with you?

189
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,730
What a good joke!

190
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,680
Which evil is there to want to be pirate?

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,540
The pirates are refuse, I refuse.

192
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,910
However…

193
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,580
It is said that you capture the pirates for the money.

194
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,050
That they say what they want,

195
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,970
I am the quiet aware.

196
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,750
What I want to do,

197
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,840
it is to achieve the goal which I set.

198
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,140
It is true?

199
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,230
But I decided that you would be member of my crew.

200
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,540
It is not with you to decide!

201
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,540
You are always like that.

202
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,160
Let finish to me front.

203
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,150
Then you were like that front?

204
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,730
I do not see a difference.

205
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,370
It is very interesting.

206
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,950
Fire!

207
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,750
You…

208
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,770
Luffy-San!

209
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,350
Straw hat!

210
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,100
Take again-that!

211
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,740
I however said it to you, that I was very strong.

212
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,890
It is not human normal,

213
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,740
he surely ate a Fruit of the Demon.

214
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,410
A Fruit of the Demon?

215
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,350
I intended to say that which ate some obtained capacities surpuissants.

216
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,460
I agree to become pirate.

217
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,660
I decided to pass on other side, to fight the Navy.

218
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,140
But I warn you…

219
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,210
I set a goal to reach.

220
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,150
A goal?

221
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,950
I want to become the largest fencer of the world!

222
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,900
And if I do not arrive there,

223
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,940
then I will commit suicide.

224
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
One goes there, Zoro!

225
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,580
Burst!

226
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,870
Not question!

227
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:53,850
Nice!

228
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,250
Thank you.

229
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,000
Please, Capitaine.

230
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,230
You are monsters both.

231
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,660
Do not be to you badly either, to have infiltrated a military base.

232
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,100
It was cake.

233
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,910
There does not exist any place which I donot can infiltrate.

234
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,610
It is true.

235
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,530
It was you on the boat of Arbyda?

236
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,170
One met over there, I remember it.

237
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,500
I burglarize the boats, then I travel everywhere

238
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,120
with my chart of Large Line,

239
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,780
and I will become rich.

240
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,030
My goal is to pile up 100 million Berrys.

241
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,160
Do a chart, you can sail?

242
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,590
Of course, I am the best.

243
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,080
Super!

244
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,700
Would that say to you to join my crew?

245
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,610
Really?

246
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,090
Ouais, I train a crew of pirates!

247
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,470
Not!

248
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,140
I hate over all the pirates.

249
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,610
Zut, I…

250
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,100
Did Nami, what take to you to do that?

251
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,350
Excuse me!

252
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,890
You believe that I will let pass that?

253
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,610
You spent time of them to save me!

254
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,160
Do not say anything!

255
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,510
I carried myself.

256
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,450
I do not want to become pirate.

257
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,820
You excite yourself easily.

258
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,290
They are pirates who killed those that I liked.

259
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,210
Ah, I include/understand…

260
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,190
Catch it!

261
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,320
Oh not!

262
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,610
You…

263
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,390
Behind you!

264
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,180
He, He!

265
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,640
Then one is caught some with a girl?

266
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,370
Zoro!!

267
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,630
You are wounded?

268
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,380
Thank you, Zoro. One would never have arrived there without you.

269
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,020
It is nothing.

270
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,960
They is super!

271
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,840
Nami, join us!

272
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,830
A super team will be trained.

273
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,660
I do not want,

274
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,090
unless you do not give up piracy.

275
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,160
How could one drop a job so well, is not this Zoro?

276
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,170
It is clear.

277
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,990
But we are still far from the goal.

278
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,230
I am hungry!!

279
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,320
You underestimate the sea.

280
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,380
Then do Nami, you unite with us?

281
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,300
Be heavy for you!

282
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,550
You do not have the Nami choice.

283
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,910
It will make very to achieve its goal.

284
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,060
Go, I am not so terrible!

285
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,270
Good Ah?

286
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,410
It is not serious.

287
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,180
In any event, I will not drop.

288
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,810
I want to become the Lord of the Pirates, it is decided!

289
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,200
I want to become the largest fencer of the world.

290
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
Which band of idiots…

291
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,490
What is there of so funny?

292
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,800
I will crush you!

293
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,120
What do you make?

294
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,860
Stop immediately!

295
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,530
These young people took the sea to achieve their goals and their ambitions.

296
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,320
They move towards Grand Line.

297
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,310
What awaits them over there?

298
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,340
Nobody knows it.

299
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,840
I will become the Lord of the Pirates!

300
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,580
Nevertheless, these young people are on the way!

301
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,790
Why do you hold as long as that to become the Lord of the Pirates?

302
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,600
There is a reason?

303
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,260
Not, not really, but…

304
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,080
But?

305
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,750
I promised it with somebody,

306
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,350
on this straw hat.

307
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,480
I see…

308
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,040
Good, ahead!

309
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,520
Worms Large Line! On the way!

310
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,420
These 20 minutes were quickly passed.

311
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,380
But now, you them spectators, you have an idea of what is One Piece.

312
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,170
I am always caught blows.

313
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,710
But you have a super technique of saber,

314
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,950
the Slash Demon.

315
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,640
They is super…

316
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,700
Pas le rice, the Slash Demon.

317
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
Another thing?

318
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,830
Afflicted, but it is a secrecy.

319
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,290
Let us hope that will not remain secret too a long time.

320
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,480
You will see…

321
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,300
If you want to fight, you gained ace!

322
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,490
Stop your gamineries.

323
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,760
Why the pirates like do so much to fight?

324
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,500
We need other team members.

325
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,890
One needs a cook and a tireur d'élite.

326
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,390
And a musician.

327
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,600
Why would one need a musician?

328
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,040
The pirates appreciate also Article.

329
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,340
Art of living should not be neglected.

330
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,250
It is quite true.

331
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,530
All will be well, one is strong.

332
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,720
Which is the report/ratio?

333
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,660
None.

334
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
Finally in short, I made my decision.

335
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,080
I will find One Piece costs that costs.

336
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,980
Watch for my adventures!

337
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,440
The series starts to become interesting.

338
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,520
With the next one!

339
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,820
Do not forget us! Goodbye!

340
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,130
I will become the Lord of the Pirates!!!

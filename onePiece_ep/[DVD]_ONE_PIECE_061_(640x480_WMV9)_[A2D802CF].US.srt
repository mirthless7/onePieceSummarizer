1
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:45,030
End of anger!

2
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:45,030
To cross Red Line!

3
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,730
A cemetery of dragons…

4
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,610
Not…

5
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,650
Not!!

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,200
Ryuji said to me that if it turned over to the nest of the dragons, it would be better!

7
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,740
That cannot be a cemetery!

8
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,830
Apis…

9
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,330
Ryuji was stray Sennenryu.

10
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,670
Luffy?

11
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,500
During 1000 years, it was all alone.

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,880
But then Apis became his friend.

13
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,930
Apart from the 1000 years that he lived,

14
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,390
it is the time passed with you Apis that he cherished more in the world.

15
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,020
Luffy… You can include/understand what the dragons say?

16
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,150
About.

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,240
Do not tell conneries.

18
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,770
But, I know what he said!

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
Liar.

20
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,070
Ryuji, liar…

21
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,960
It is a nest of dragons.

22
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,070
The nest of the dragons was found,

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,850
then opens the eyes!

24
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,420
Speak to me!

25
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,460
You will be better!

26
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,960
Ryuji did not lie.

27
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,400
He said that Sennenryu was to turn over to the nest of the dragons every 1000 years

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,630
to reappear.

29
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,390
Ryuji would be…

30
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,440
Look at over there!

31
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,830
A Sennenryu baby!

32
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,540
Out of my way!!!!

33
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,860
Be to you you still there?

34
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,850
Ouais.

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,980
A little more and I would have drowned.

36
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,440
Admire.

37
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
This place is splendid.

38
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,740
Isn't this marvellous?

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,210
It is the source of the elixir of youth…

40
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,630
Ryukotsu!

41
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,960
But with of Sennenryu calcified,

42
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,760
it is impossible to make an elixir.

43
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,880
Indeed.

44
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,560
But you forget the herd living of Ryukotsu which is there.

45
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,680
By the way,

46
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,350
I am tired of this useless battle.

47
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,600
Why this treasure would not be divided?

48
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,190
Not question!

49
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,940
You do not wish the eternal life?

50
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,940
I am not interested.

51
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,320
Liar!!!

52
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,240
There is not only one man who is not frightened by death!

53
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,370
And for you and me which ate a Fruit of the Demon,

54
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,330
the border is very thin of this world with demise!

55
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,910
It is impossible that you would not be frightened by death!

56
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,040
It is what you believe…

57
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,460
But if this type is exposed there,
he will die with the smile with the lips.

58
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,590
I see.

59
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,090
Then very well!

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,340
You can sit down there and look at,

61
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,260
while I only assert Ryukotsu for me!

62
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,550
Not!

63
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,840
Remain in your place, small plague!

64
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,860
Apis!

65
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,060
Usopp!

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,750
Would not be so carefree, Apis!

67
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,310
I owe it even if it is imprudent!

68
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,820
It is a place crowned for Sennenryu!

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,950
I will protect this place…
for always!!!!!

70
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,580
You want to always prevent me?

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,630
Then you all will die here.

72
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,840
Luffy!

73
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,230
It is with me.

74
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,610
But, Luffy!

75
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,300
I promised.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,320
I cannot about it any more?

77
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,630
Would not be if defaitist!

78
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,140
Our goal yet was not achieved!

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,130
One will go to the nest of the dragons, not truth?

80
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,920
I do not want to hear any more of “I cannot about it any more”!

81
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,660
You know that I am right.

82
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,640
You do not have to worry for Apis!

83
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,100
It is all that you can do, man-rubber band?

84
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,610
And now,

85
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,440
ultimate technique of the kamaitachi.

86
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,240
It does not matter where you will hide,
you will not be able to escape from it.

87
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,740
I wonder whether you will be able to support it.

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,360
It is foutu.

89
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,870
Is Luffy in danger?

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,210
Luffy…

91
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,100
I will not flee to hide!

92
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,390
Poor idiot!

93
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,000
I will cut you of pieces!

94
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,990
It is what it…

95
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,140
and…

96
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,180
I gained!

97
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,020
One succeeded!!

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,660
It is what all that?

99
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,840
They really exist?

100
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,960
Then it was not a legend?

101
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,700
I suppose that it will be réengloutir again like before.

102
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,570
When will that occur, Sennenryu will set out again, hein?

103
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,800
This Sennenryu baby will go elsewhere also, I suppose…

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,680
Then, would you like to pass to the house to taste my famous butaman?

105
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,100
Oh, one would have really liked,

106
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,350
but one must refuse.

107
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,130
We are pressed a little, you see.

108
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,410
One is it?

109
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,440
I wanted to test…

110
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,110
Thank you for the proposal, but one must leave.

111
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,990
Oh, as it is damage.

112
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,700
That would have taken three days to prepare them.

113
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,080
And meanwhile, I would have told you the history of the royalty of Lost Island.

114
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,990
Oh, one already heard this history.

115
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,940
Super!

116
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,590
Full sail towards Large Line!

117
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,340
Do Apis, you want to come?

118
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,690
I spent much pleasant moments with you the guy, I would like

119
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,450
but I must remain here on this island.

120
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,930
I want to learn some a little more on our habits with Grand-Père Bokuden.

121
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,820
And just like our ancestors who protected Sennenryu,

122
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,480
I will protect the nest from the dragons.

123
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,200
I will wait the day when the babies dragons will turn over on the island.

124
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,700
Wait one minute…
The next time they will return in…

125
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,670
It would not be in 1000 years?

126
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,670
Do not say anything which could ruin its dreams.

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,090
I know that I will not be able to see the babies dragons when they will grow,

128
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,510
but my children, or their children will be able.

129
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,930
And we will protect this island forever!

130
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,110
You are odd!

131
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,850
You them guy you made odd tricks the every day, not truth?

132
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,770
It is true?

133
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,180
Goodbye, Apis!

134
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,280
Apis! Do not forget me!

135
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,120
The honest warrior of the seas, Usopp-Sama!

136
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,820
Bye Bye!

137
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,920
Bye Bye!

138
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,450
Everyone!

139
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,500
Made attention with you!!

140
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,710
You too! Make attention with you, Apis!

141
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,420
Bye!

142
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,240
Bye Bye!

143
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,940
Bye Bye!

144
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,060
You believe that Apis will go well all alone?

145
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,860
Apis will manage.

146
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,150
It is perhaps small,
but it is crafty one and courageous.

147
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,610
She will go well.

148
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,240
You are right, Nami-San.

149
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,400
It is perfect.

150
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,690
Ouais.

151
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,730
Is Apis our friend, not true?

152
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
It is certain.

153
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,960
You did not want to leave with them, Apis?

154
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,550
If I had left with them, I should have followed their road.

155
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,800
Out, there are things which I want to make here!

156
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,300
I am about to do something of incredible.

157
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,040
If I had not met Luffy and his crew,

158
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,470
I would never have thought that I could have protected this island.

159
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,070
I would have even thought that to protect it was impossible.

160
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,430
However when Luffy and its crew took Ryuji with them to seek it,

161
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
they never believed that impossible.

162
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,750
If you really believe in your convictions and that you fight until the end,

163
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,400
you can achieve anything.

164
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,300
It is that which they taught me.

165
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,260
They said that to help their friends they put all their heart at it.

166
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,680
They risk their lives for that.

167
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,450
And now, I am me also become their friend!

168
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,530
Then I will give all that I have!

169
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,940
He fell asleep…

170
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,120
He, could you help me to achieve my dreams?

171
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,430
Thank you!

172
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,590
Allons-y!

173
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,120
While speaking about that, if you intend to protect Lost Island,

174
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,620
you will need to learn from the things on our ancestors.

175
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,590
Let us start with the first king.

176
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,260
That is enough, I do not need to hear it!

177
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,880
Apis, return by here!

178
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,040
Stop!!

179
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,300
Wait! You must listen to me.

180
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,260
Nooooonnnnn!!!!

181
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,880
Apis!

182
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,750
Nami-San!

183
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,000
With the report/ratio my love!

184
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,190
I see enormous clouds mortals right in front of,

185
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,460
with a storm right in lower part.

186
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,000
I suppose that we returned on our road.

187
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,620
We should see Red Line soon.

188
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,020
One goes finally worms Grand Line!

189
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
He, Sanji!

190
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,480
One goes there!

191
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,360
One goes there!

192
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,360
One goes there!

193
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,630
Stop that!

194
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,270
Afflicted…

195
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,610
Zoro!

196
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,070
But…

197
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,200
One goes there!

198
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,570
One goes there!

199
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,740
One goes there!

200
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,740
is the chart correct?

201
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,290
Stop that!!

202
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,490
Look at that.

203
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,080
I had heard rumors,
but it is also written here on the chart.

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,530
If it is true, then the entry of Large Line is a mountain.

205
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,410
A mountain?

206
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,890
You want to say that one will run up against a mountain?

207
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,560
Good blood…

208
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,790
I also thought that it was madness, but…

209
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,560
there are channels drawn along the wall of the mountain.

210
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,770
That means that one must climb it.

211
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,090
That seems amusing!

212
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,810
About what you do speak?

213
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,660
Even if there are channels,

214
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,050
it is impossible for a boat to climb a mountain.

215
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,200
But it is what the chart says.

216
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,120
Of course!

217
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,580
It is impossible that Nami-San is mistaken!

218
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,450
You stole the chart in Buggy, not true?

219
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,990
You have really confidence?

220
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,350
Zorooo!

221
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,470
I with this blasted rudder helps!

222
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,780
Sanji-Kun, Usopp, do you want will help?

223
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,660
I do not manage to think with this din.

224
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,460
Sanji, come to help me!

225
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,830
Yes, Nami-San!

226
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,680
One goes there!

227
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,220
What?

228
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,850
The current is too much strong!

229
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,190
Do Usopp, repeat to me that?

230
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,100
I said that the current is too much strong!

231
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,280
The current…

232
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,250
I included/understood!

233
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,200
Included/understood what?

234
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,230
One must really climb the mountain.

235
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,540
You did not already say that?

236
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,830
Look by here.

237
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,560
Listen.

238
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,200
There is no doubt, the “light which us guide” is indicated here.

239
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,580
Here on Red Line, Mountain Reverse.

240
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,060
He! I am supposed to do what here?

241
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,180
You see the channel here?

242
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,750
If a high tension current coming from one of the quatres oceans runs out towards this mountain,

243
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,300
the current quatres will climb the mountain, will meet at the top

244
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,420
and will run out directly in bottom towards Grand Line.

245
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,430
After Reverse Mountain “Winter Island is”,

246
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,140
the currents which enter in collision with Red Line circulate of bottom towards the surface of the ocean.

247
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,350
If we do not manage to enter the channel,

248
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,860
the Vogue-Merry will be crashed to pieces on Red Line

249
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,310
and the boat will be destroyed.

250
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,790
There will remain nothing any more but remains on the ocean.

251
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,490
Included/understood?

252
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,070
I see!

253
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,600
Then it is a Mysterious Mountain, it is that?

254
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,790
I suspected well that you would not have included/understood anything.

255
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,880
In any case, this boat follows already one of these currents.

256
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,840
Thus if one manages to preserve this direction,

257
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,110
one will be able to succeed in assembling Reverse Mountain intact.

258
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,240
Nami-San, you are incredible!

259
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,120
I never heard that.

260
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,770
Boats which climb mountains.

261
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,650
I heard something.

262
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,560
On the Mysterious Mountain?

263
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,040
Not.

264
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:24,700
Only that half of those which tried to return on Grand Line died about it.

265
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,400
Then I know that it will not be easy to return there.

266
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,160
Sanji-Kun, the sail please!

267
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,530
Immediately, Nami-San!

268
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,790
Luffy, moves your bottom from here!

269
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,630
He!

270
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,850
I can see Reverse Montain!

271
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,970
What?

272
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,050
It is immense!

273
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,570
The entry towards Large Line.

274
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,150
Then it is Red Line, hein?

275
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,330
You cannot even see the top beyond the clouds!!

276
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,060
One will be made aspire!!

277
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,790
Seize the rudder!

278
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,390
Let make me!

279
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,390
We have it!

280
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,110
N-Nami!

281
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,610
Where is the entry?

282
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,280
If one quickly does not change a course, one will sink right in cliff!

283
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,480
This crack in cliff…

284
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,160
Nami, which do we have to make?

285
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,870
Maintain the course!

286
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,160
Be sure for you?

287
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,170
Do it!

288
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,240
Is Nami, it the entry of the channel?

289
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,460
Perhaps…

290
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,090
Unthinkable…

291
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,830
Water climbs really the mountain.

292
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,220
Do you ensure that one passes between these gates, Ok?

293
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,780
If it is not the case,
the boat will be tiny room of pieces!

294
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,780
We derive!

295
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,650
More towards the line!

296
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,270
On the right, on the right!

297
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,240
On the right?

298
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,580
Ok, with starboard all!

299
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,280
The rudder!!!

300
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,520
Luffy!!

301
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,460
My hand catches!

302
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,370
One succeeded!!!!

303
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,380
And now, straight until the top!

304
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,970
Super!

305
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,720
He, I want to see that too!

306
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,640
Incredible!

307
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,840
Dirty bastard!

308
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,360
The type of the fruit of Okama…

309
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,740
Bastard, you are still in life?

310
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,760
You never give up?

311
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,370
The farm!

312
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,740
You cross me for the last time…

313
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,820
Because of you my dream to obtain from Ryukotsu is foutu!

314
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,310
But I will not let that finish like that!!

315
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,900
I will have at least the pleasure of empocher the 30.000.000

316
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,090
Go maintaining!

317
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,360
What do we have to make?

318
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,300
If it uses its kamaitachi here,

319
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,520
one cannot know what it will cut!

320
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,510
There is no place where to go…

321
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,670
Well!

322
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,400
Not only one among you cannot pose the little finger on me!

323
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,990
Ah! Of Ryukotsu!

324
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,820
Bye Bye!

325
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,520
Oh! One did not think of that!

326
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,690
Now that it is an anvil,
it will be able to annoy us never again!

327
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,110
Even if it could swim,
the current is agitated too much!

328
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,720
That it is my Nami-San!

329
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,360
One arrived to the clouds!

330
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,570
Incredible!!

331
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,580
One is above the clouds!

332
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:40,350
Look at!

333
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,140
The top of the mountain!

334
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,350
It is the top!

335
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,420
Yahoo!!

336
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,360
Mihawk is here…

337
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,540
Readier of All Blue…

338
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,350
A chart supplements…

339
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,940
To prove that I am the bravest pirate…

340
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,290
I can see it,

341
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,170
the largest ocean of the world…

342
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,510
Large Line!

343
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,170
And some share at the horizon,

344
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,300
One Piece awaits us!

345
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,800
Ahead!!!

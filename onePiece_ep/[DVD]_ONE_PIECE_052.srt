1
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,110
The revenge of Buggy!

2
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,110
The man who smiles, attached to his execution post!

3
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,830
Hat!

4
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,250
Wait!!

5
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,390
Wait, Strawhat!!

6
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,510
Finally here you is, Hat!

7
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,010
Here thus what saw it
Lord of the Pirates before dying!

8
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,300
Lastly, the hour of my revenge sounded.

9
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,130
Wait a little, salts Straw hat.

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,010
It finally left its hole.

11
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
It spent time of them…

12
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,020
Wait please, Colonel Smoker!

13
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,510
Am me, Tashigi!

14
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,410
Yes!

15
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,350
He, look on the platform of execution.

16
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,500
Who it is, him?

17
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,050
Then that occurred 22 years ago…

18
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,520
Ici-même the Lord of the Pirates died.

19
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,770
Hola, you up there!

20
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,770
Go down immediately!

21
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,520
Why?

22
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:28,670
It is a historic building placed under the responsibility of the World Government!
Then go down now!

23
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,530
Why you play the spoilsport like that,
Officer-San?

24
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,080
Go down or I put to you in a state of arrest.
Attention I arrive!

25
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,290
You will have to await your turn, my old man.

26
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,850
I sought you, Luffy.
That made a long time.

27
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,410
Do not say to me that you forgot my beautiful face.

28
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,950
What a beauty!

29
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,090
Pretty!

30
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,120
A model of perfection.

31
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,800
It is like soft a small flower!

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,710
I never met somebody who resembles you…

33
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,040
Who are you?

34
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,580
I will never forget you.

35
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,200
Since you are the first man to have struck me!

36
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,360
What? I struck you?

37
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,590
At this moment, your powerful super fist…

38
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,800
disturbed me much…

39
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,260
My darlings, who is more the beautiful woman
of all the seas?

40
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,550
It is you, Madam!

41
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,250
Exact, it is me!

42
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,750
There does not exist any man in the world which
would not put at knee in front of my beauty,

43
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,890
and I love the strong men.

44
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,000
I want that you would be with me, Luffy.

45
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,610
Keep silent yourself! Not question!
Be to you which finally?

46
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,550
You still did not guess?

47
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,560
It is the police force!
Madam, follow us nicely!

48
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,410
I put to you in a state of arrest
for violence towards a police officer!

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,320
And, immediately kill you from there!!

50
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,830
Ah? And which thus want you to stop?

51
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,660
You…

52
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,720
My darlings, I wonder whether you of it will be able…

53
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,230
Inspector, it is difficult.
It is too much beautiful!

54
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,710
One of fout of his beauty!
Capture it!

55
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,980
It is like a splendid dream!

56
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,640
I am content that the same opinion is divided!

57
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,850
The special bomb Buggy!

58
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,820
What?

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,620
The fountain slipped along its skin!

60
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,440
What did it occur at the moment?

61
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,190
It a little dangerous, was not cherished?

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,500
Afflicted.

63
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,550
But with your skin sube sube, you will leave yourself there
always without any damage, not true?

64
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,550
Sube Sube means very smooth and soft

65
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,020
Then does not worry you
my dear Lady Aluvida!

66
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,780
Aluvida?

67
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,920
It is where Aluvida?

68
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,190
I am, idiotic there.

69
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,290
It is a joke?
You resemble to him at all!

70
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,080
After having eaten a Fruit of the Demon,
I changed a little.

71
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,880
The name of this Fruit is… Sube Sube.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,110
Whatever the type of attack used,
I will not even have a scratch on my skin.

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,280
I remain always as beautiful as before.

74
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,190
What only changed into me:
it is the disappearance of my freckles.

75
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,400
Not, it is not at all what I wanted to say…

76
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,750
I live again now. And to find you,
I had to combine to me with this gentleman behind me.

77
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,590
The final act!
My great return!

78
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,140
Monkey D. Luffy, since the day
where you sent valser to me,

79
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,570
I never ceased thinking of my revenge!

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,210
Moreover, me and my comrades let us have
had to pass by enormous sufferings.

81
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,730
It was really an great adventure!

82
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,720
I knew venture funny, infernal
and sometimes close friends of Minis-Buggy.

83
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,660
But now, Buggy-kun is…
But why you do not speak?

84
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,800
What? Euh it is what its name:
Boggy… Not, Bouggy or Beuhii?

85
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,130
Ah yes! It is Bouffon!

86
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,130
Luffy pronounces English Buffoon

87
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,130
Buffoon? Te insane step of me!

88
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,610
Be as weak for you as the last time,
cretin of Straw hat!

89
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,650
It is Buggy the Clown!

90
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Pirates?

91
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,280
It is the crew of pirates of Buggy!

92
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,690
You all! Do not move any more!

93
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,890
Or if not I will show you with all
at which point I am terrible…

94
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,320
Ah! It is Buggy!

95
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,750
Is that only now that you remember it?

96
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,160
What?

97
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,480
That made a long time, man-rubber band.

98
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,210
Is Roronoa Zoro well?

99
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,040
Well. Good job, Kabaji.

100
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,170
Look at, inhabitants of this big city,

101
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,040
a public execution soon will take place!

102
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,480
Monkey D. Luffy, this time,
you will not be able any more to draw you like that.

103
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,780
You will die exactly in the same place
that the Lord of the Pirates formerly.

104
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,680
The pressure of the air is falling.

105
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,680
I never saw a fall of similar pressure…

106
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,110
It is true, I find the wind odd.

107
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
A storm will fall down on this island!

108
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,770
A storm?

109
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,990
One must return as quickly as possible to the boat…

110
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,680
It will be so powerful that?

111
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,240
He!

112
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,890
Zoro!

113
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,030
You saw it in the corner?

114
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,190
Who, Luffy?

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,060
Yes, I lost it.

116
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,580
In more… I have a very bad presentiment.

117
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,160
It would be said that something
from important will occur.

118
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,810
Pirates!

119
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,200
The pirates are there.

120
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,850
Let us flee!

121
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,330
It is Buggy the Clown!

122
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,940
What do they say?

123
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,210
Buggy the Clown!

124
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,620
What? You say that…

125
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,770
Or… Yes!

126
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,880
With Luffy with the Straw hat,

127
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,200
there is also Buggy the Clown and Aluvida with the Steel Mass.

128
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,650
They are all the three of the pirates
of East Blue having eaten Fruits of the Demon.

129
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,010
Very right under my nose… which imbeciles…

130
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,010
What will you make, Colonel Smoker?

131
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,310
Send a first unit to the port

132
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,210
and order at the second to encircle the public place and the remainder comes with me…

133
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,650
Execution!

134
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,140
The mission of the first unit is:

135
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,030
to find and destroy all the ships of the pirates
as well as the pirates them-even.

136
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,170
Do not leave in any manner only one
of these dogs to leave the island.

137
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,920
An execution!

138
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,140
There will be an execution!

139
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,170
Buggy the Clown will carry out
Luffy with the Straw hat!

140
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,300
Will Luffy be carried out?

141
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,040
This imbecile!

142
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,810
Allons-y!

143
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,990
Hold, catches!

144
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,670
Sanji!

145
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,910
Take care as if it were a woman!

146
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,440
We also, one must hurry.

147
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,660
He Does Nami, one go where?

148
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,440
With the port, obviously!

149
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,620
With the port? Ah, I see…

150
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,010
Colonel Smoker, throw a glance!

151
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,630
There is something of strange.

152
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,360
Hein? The kid?

153
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,720
What do they make?

154
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,280
Monkey D. Luffy. It is not true,
it would be said that it will be carried out.

155
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
How did it arrive from there there?

156
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,590
I must see it,
the place where the Lord of the Pirates died!

157
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,720
I believed that it was different from the pirates
that I knew,

158
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,840
and that it had absolutely to be supervised.

159
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,210
But it is right a pirate like the others.

160
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,710
Does colonel, one start to attack?

161
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,280
Imbecile, y' would have more brothel.

162
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,950
But to remain nothing here to make…

163
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,250
It is me which gives the orders here!

164
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,820
Yes!

165
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,700
The pirates who entretuent themselves, that arranges us.

166
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,160
One does not need to make the dirty job.

167
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,450
Listen. Once the head of
Straw hat will fly in the airs,

168
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,270
you encircle Buggy, Aluvida and the remainder of the crew!

169
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,010
Questions?

170
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:38,810
Pirate Monkey D. Luffy, to have me as much
irritated and to be to you foutu of me,

171
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,880
you will be carried out…

172
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,600
from one moment to another!

173
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,640
Oh, it is the first time that I see an execution!

174
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,490
It is your execution!

175
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,370
Hein? You insane of me?

176
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,160
It is you who you insane of me!

177
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,800
Our principal event of the day:
the execution soon will start!

178
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,850
Leave me! Leave me!

179
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,200
Come to my help! With the assistance!! Nooon!

180
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,980
I saw in the east of large cumulonimbi which were formed!

181
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,580
The storm arrives! The largest storm
ever seen before!

182
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,100
If Buggy and Luffy start to fight,
the Navy certainly will be shown!

183
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,340
One will do what if they make run the boat whereas one needs some to flee?

184
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,950
I include/understand.
It is serious!

185
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,520
Moreover, it may be that the Navy
that is to say already on the spot.

186
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,430
The Vogue-Merry is in danger.

187
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,790
If the Navy seizes the Vogue-Merry…

188
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,820
He Nami, I pass in front!

189
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,260
Await me!

190
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,360
We dispatch outward journey with the port!

191
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,510
You must destroy all them
pirate boats which you will see!

192
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,200
Yes!

193
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,540
That which assembles Ritchie!

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,510
But which it is? But which? But which?

195
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,580
It is me!

196
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,480
Is it the boat of the man-rubber band that?

197
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,410
It is much larger than the precedent.

198
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,420
But good, at this hour it already had to taste
with the revenge on the Buggy Captain!

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,040
However,

200
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,700
even if this man-rubber band has a chance on 10.000 to flee, I must burn this vessel!

201
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,260
And that, it is our job!

202
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,730
I am sorry. I will not do it any more.
Save to me please.

203
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,330
I nevertheless will not save you, cretin!

204
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,580
It is the price to pay to have made us your enemies.

205
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,440
And it is the end of the man whom I had
finally more sought in the world.

206
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,630
Which are your last words?

207
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,230
There are many people here.

208
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,560
Well, it would be said that you do not have anything to say.

209
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,190
You are about to die after all.

210
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,570
I WILL BECOME THE LORD OF THE PIRATES!!!

211
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:41,800
I will become the Lord of the Pirates…

212
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,760
What?

213
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,430
The Lord of the Pirates?

214
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,740
In this city, on this platform…

215
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,660
Why he said that?

216
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,250
It is high time to finish some, not truth?
Dirtiness of man-rubber band!

217
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,120
This execution…

218
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,460
is cancelled!!

219
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,360
Zoro! Sanji!

220
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,540
Zoro?

221
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,130
You really know how
to put the disorder in a city, Luffy!

222
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,420
If it is the beginning of the reversal of situation,
I believe well that I will take part in it too.

223
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,840
In any case, before
it will be necessary to get rid of these small pirates…

224
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,740
The Hunter of Pirates… Zoro!

225
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,310
Sanji! Zoro!

226
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,300
Be to you finally there, Zoro?
But it is a little bit too late!

227
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,280
The platform!
Let us destroy it!

228
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,060
Roronoa Zoro.

229
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,660
Go ahead, my darlings!

230
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,210
Of course that one goes there!

231
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,990
Aluvida Born-San…

232
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,750
Out of my way!

233
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,190
It is too late, you will not be able to stop me!

234
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,330
It is the end of your Captain!

235
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,510
What a jerk!

236
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,670
If I could just cut the support of the platform…

237
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,300
Remember, as soon as the head of Monkey D. Luffy
fly in the airs, one attacks in force.

238
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,030
All in position.

239
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,980
Yes!

240
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,040
Zoro!

241
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,010
Sanji!

242
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,090
Usopp!

243
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,210
We dispatch!

244
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,950
Nami!

245
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,530
It is heavy!

246
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,570
Afflicted.
I died!

247
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,810
Do not speak about misfortune, imbecile!

248
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,490
He smiles!

249
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,850
He, I am alive!

250
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,510
It is O.K. !

251
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,440
Do He, you believe in a God?

252
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,300
- What it was high!
Do He, you believe in a God?

253
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,600
- It is not the moment to speak about it,
I thought that I was going to remain there.

254
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,660
let us leave this city.

255
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,830
It would be said that there is no more danger from now on.

256
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,610
Now! Encircle all the pirates!

257
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,740
They arrive!

258
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,130
Super!
He, what a gigantic combat!

259
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,590
Excel! Excel!

260
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,600
He, Luffy!

261
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,170
Oh, Zoro!

262
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,900
Idiot, one will not remain here to look at them fighting.

263
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,860
One from goes away!

264
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,240
All for the boat, it is necessary to leave the island if not
one will not be able to go any more to Grand Line…

265
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,290
What? One must hurry then!

266
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,310
Straw hat and its companions flee!

267
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,910
Stop them! Continue them!

268
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,630
Why?

269
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,240
Did it know that it was going to be saved?

270
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,160
Not. At this time,
it had understood that its life was going to finish.

271
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,660
Its death, it had accepted it.
It was ready and it smiled.

272
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,010
Colonel, in connection with the capture of the pirates…

273
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,810
He, you…

274
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,180
You already saw a pirate
to laugh right before its execution?

275
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,740
Never considering that of my life…

276
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,580
Even largest mouths

277
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,580
were frightened during their execution.

278
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,120
He smiled, this man with the straw hat.

279
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,580
22 years before, here in this city,

280
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:13,240
during its execution, the Lord of the Pirates
Gold Roger smiled in the same way.

281
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,620
Colonel…

282
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,780
Where is Straw hat?

283
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,800
Yes! He flees in this moment towards the port.

284
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,150
Report/ratio of the first unit?

285
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,870
They already had to destroy all the ships at this hour.

286
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,740
Euh… Because of this so sudden rain,
the powder is soaked.

287
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,470
They go into reverse to be restocked.

288
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,510
What you ace known as?

289
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,100
If, our troops of reserve
are ready at your disposal.

290
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
Colonel Smoker,

291
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,530
if these people manage to put the veils,
they will be able to then move towards Grand Line!

292
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,400
The wind blows towards the west.

293
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,100
They have an ideal wind to leave…

294
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,680
Is that all only sheer coincidence?

295
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,500
It would be said that the Sky itself
makes a point of preserving the life of this man…

296
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,490
Dispatch we to leave from here!

297
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,610
Let us go to Grand Line!

298
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,370
Me Smoker the White Hunter, I swear in so much
that Colonel of the HQ of the Navy that

299
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,540
this man will never leave this island!

300
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,820
The wind blows…

301
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,110
Here the storm of the destiny!

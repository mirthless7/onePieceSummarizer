1
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:21,673
You knew at the end of the ocean,
there was a fabulous treasure?

2
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:24,423
That which will find it will become
the Lord of the Pirates.

3
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,083
Es you as excited as me?

4
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:29,254
There are incredible adventures
who await nothing any more but us!

5
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,854
Then, uncle fortress?

6
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:56,184
I had left to lend hands
strong with my companions.

7
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:04,254
We are the elite of Navarone!

8
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:09,464
We will show them our
relentless direction of the capture!

9
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,144
Shit! Shit!

10
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:24,453

00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:26,854
The special plan captures
is operational.

12
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,354
We will put the hands on
pirates of straw hat.

13
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,674
Remain nevertheless on your guards.

14
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:33,834
What goes one,
Nami?

15
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,353
Where one goes?

16
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:39,954
We will follow Doctor Kobato.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Smash the barricade! 
going Merry is recovered!

18
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:01,224
Be sure for you that it is by there Ussop?

19
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:04,444
They is good, I am sure and certain,
it is this way which it is necessary to take.

20
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,503
Here, here, it is here!

21
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:10,073
One takes on the right, it is
over there how Merry is moored!

22
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:12,494
However that appears too much
beautiful to be true…

23
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,633
Y' has a trick which bell.

24
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:18,204
Well! It is necessary to recover
the boat as fast as possible!

25
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,123
It is incredible!

26
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:34,923
It is surely one of theirs
units of tireurs d'élites.

27
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,774
They do not have nowhere or outward journey!

28
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,674
You put out of cheek!

29
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:41,573
It is so sudden!

30
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:45,534
Gomu Gomu No

31
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:46,594
Fire!

32
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,924
Fuusen!

33
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:57,224
What you insane?!

34
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,424
Heavy artillery, in position!

35
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,553
Shit, of the bazookas.

36
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,664
Fire!

37
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:03,944
Shit.

38
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:09,914
They is forgeries?

39
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:16,664
Is whore, it what that?
My eyes burn me.

40
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:19,003
I saw a trick which dazzled me!

41
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,664
They are teargas grenades.

42
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,914
Regiment of infantry in your turn!

43
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:24,534
Kill them!

44
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,084
Dumbs!

45
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:39,803
I am well!

46
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:41,973
Did Oh, you use them?

47
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:43,143
I have a pair for you.

48
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:43,944
Ok!

49
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,094
Tatsumaki!!

50
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:52,243
I am not like the other moron who
spends its days to run the underskirts.

51
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:53,334
Hein?

52
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:57,553
Gomu Gomu No

53
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:01,323
Gatling Gun!

54
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:02,324
No

55
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,974
Mushi!

56
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,883
Too much easy!

57
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:14,213
Hold, where passed Sanji and Zoro?

58
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,343
It is you who massacred them!!!

59
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:16,973
Ah, sorry…

60
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,733
Large idiot!

61
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:19,553
Whore…

62
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:23,324
He, the green alga what
you told presently?

63
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,433
It is not the moment of you chamailler!

64
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,494
Fire!

65
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:37,884
Whore, I am not able to leave me from there.

66
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:38,963
Luffy!

67
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,764
More one gesture!

68
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:44,504
the least gesture can
you to cost the life.

69
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,874
the commander of the G8 base us
asked to capture you alive.

70
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:52,004
But if you oppose resistance to us, I could not be guaranteeing of anything.

71
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:54,533
H-He, Luffy.

72
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,733
We does not leave in the shit!

73
00:05:56,734 --> 00:06:00,543
I test, but I do not leave myself there…

74
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:04,623
And I do not know why,
but I empty myself my forces.

75
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:05,653
Kairoseki?

76
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:06,243
How?

77
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:07,424
Exactly!

78
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:10,624
This net at especially conceived summer
for the holders of fruits of the demon.

79
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,834
Then, Straw hat?

80
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,963
Te revoilà finally.

81
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:25,224
What do you make?

82
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,814
They is dangereous because of here!

83
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:30,004
Pas la pains to excite you.

84
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,864
[Note] Pinch:Bad posture

85
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:39,374
Whore…

86
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,173
Impossible to count them,
why are they so numerous?

87
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:44,293
You would make better return to you.

88
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:46,704
You cannot beat a retreat.

89
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,434
Arm!

90
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,914
Fact of shitting, it should be fought.

91
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,464
Go ahead!

92
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,134
What does it occur here?

93
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:17,163
Hein? It is…

94
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:19,223
Ah… Afflicted. I will die…

95
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:20,414
Ussop!

96
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:22,474
Who wounded you also seriously?

97
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,623
They are the soldiers of the Navy?!

98
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,083
Bandage dumbs!!!

99
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,363
Not, not, not.

100
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,234
Hein? Kobato?

101
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:32,324
Euh, My-Major…

102
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,864
What you made?!!

103
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,173
What it you
takes suddenly?

104
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,224
One took to us as an hostage!!

105
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:50,214
With the help!!!

106
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:53,553
They forced us to follow them!!!

107
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,884
Kobato-san?

108
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,613
The species of giant cuddly toy
fact also part of the pirates!

109
00:07:58,614 --> 00:07:59,503
Wait, what
you tell at the end?

110
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:00,743
It is what this circus?

111
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,713
- But which is this young young lady?
- I took to you as an hostage?

112
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:03,924
I know anything of it.

113
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:06,483
I include/understand there nothing any more.

114
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:09,483
As long as they retain them as an hostage,
it is be likely to draw to them above.

115
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:13,393
Dumbs! You are really
pirates, bandages cowards!

116
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:16,423
It is the man who was
infiltrated in the infirmary.

117
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:19,234
It was thus true, it did not have
nothing known as with his/her companions.

118
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:22,243
Exactly!

119
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:25,024
I make party indeed of
the crew of Straw hat,

120
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,424
I am that which one
call “the Rough one”!

121
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:31,894
If you made not only I you
, I say will crush you until the last!!

122
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:37,554
And then initially, that you make
still on my way?

123
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:39,493
I see.

124
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:40,803
It is very interesting.

125
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,424
And how that jumps!

126
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:46,253
If not I break the neck with his 2 wives.

127
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:48,013
It will do it without hesitating!

128
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:51,324
It is much more damaged than
us when it is with work…

129
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:56,794
A true dispenser of justice cannot leave
two women to die under its eyes.

130
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:01,273
Chopper, blunder, or you make
will finish in the same shit as me.

131
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,184
Firm your large mouth!

132
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,083
It will kill us!!

133
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,674
Please, made
what he says to you!

134
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:32,963
Not!

135
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,063
Not, not and not!

136
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,944
How much time I would have
you to repeat it?!

137
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:37,383
It is food for
a thousand of people.

138
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:39,673
One will be able to never leave oneself there if
you made not good job!

139
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:40,634
Too much slow!

140
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,163
All but not the ladle.

141
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:45,624
What thus? You have a problem?

142
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:46,783
First of all…

143
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:50,393
It will be necessary to put your pride on side if you want that I come you to assistance.

144
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:53,014
Well, come prepare
ingredients here!

145
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:56,514
Said, Jessica-san in
fact not a little too…

146
00:09:56,604 --> 00:10:00,133
She has still evil to believe that the other cook was in fact one of the pirates.

147
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,583
And then these two others
are good that to complain.

148
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:04,483
They are goods with nothing.

149
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,283
I do not have you
to ask to bring back it.

150
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:07,583
Yes! All our excuses!

151
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:10,974
He, Billy, taste one
little my special sauce.

152
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:12,784
Then, they is good?

153
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:14,933
Or not…

154
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,994
Not it is good but…

155
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,973
It is that which one
concocte each time…

156
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,764
Yes, yes, completely.

157
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:24,893
Since I tasted
food of the other type…

158
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:28,034
I have always the impression to forget
something when I cook a dish.

159
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,573
It is not that they are bad, but
there is always a trick which bell…

160
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:35,124
I have evil to admit it but it is necessary well to acknowledge that the other type was rather gifted.

161
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,544
Doesn't whore, what go?

162
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:38,963
Jessica-sama?

163
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,884
Hum… What?

164
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:43,794
Euh… What does one have to do that?

165
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:48,653
It is a receipt which wrote
the other type before fleeing.

166
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:49,653
The pirate?

167
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,053
A receipt?

168
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:52,794
I remember it…

169
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:56,034
One minute please, it
time to write a receipt.

170
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,193
What do you want to make some now?

171
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,903
Ah… Ben… I…

172
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:05,163
Since it tried hard of
to write, one could make use of it…

173
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,673
Do not say stupidities!

174
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,524
One should not depend on a pirate!

175
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,694
We are the cooks
of Navarone after all!

176
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,733
He is the enemy of those which
we endeavor to nourish.

177
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:16,954
It remains you with
less one bit of pride?

178
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:18,893
Euhh…

179
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:21,684
It is known well that you
be exasperated but…

180
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,503
It is what this brothel?!

181
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:27,793
You do not even know
to peel a potato!

182
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,683
Euh, usually it
are the subordinates…

183
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,973
One forever known to make.

184
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:34,574
Listen! We are
within an army…

185
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,153
Here, the least apple of
ground has its importance.

186
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,424
Even cry them of apples
as ground are used with…

187
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:45,413
Euhhh…

188
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,123
You dispatch and peel them
with the greatest care!

189
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,894
Ouuuuuuuiiiiii!

190
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,633
My-major…

191
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:07,344
Make pass the order of fold.

192
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:09,784
Lower all your weapons and move back!

193
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:12,144
Break the formation!

194
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,574
The tireurs d'élite, lower your rifles.

195
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,394
Major…

196
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:18,314
There is nothing to make…

197
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:21,693
Oh, Ca with the air to go.

198
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,334
Such an amount of better.

199
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:24,264
Hein?

200
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,524
You saved me, Zoro.

201
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:38,193
Wasn't He, it the voice of Kobato-san?

202
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:39,653
You think too?

203
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:40,774
Mechanic-san.

204
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:42,233
What does it occur?

205
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,793
Kobato was taken as an hostage.

206
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:44,563
What?!

207
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,103
Really, that fears!

208
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:47,363
Ah, of made to you not.

209
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:50,443
Ca does not change only my daughter
howl or not, I have the practice…

210
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,744
I am rather anxious…

211
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,944
For these.

212
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,984
As you can it
to see, the way is free.

213
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,753
Now, release the hostages.

214
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,554
Brilliant, that went!

215
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:04,583
He, Chopper.

216
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:09,273
Impossible! We will not release the hostages solely that after us to be flee.

217
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:11,013
Dumb!

218
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:14,813
Your orders were
transmitted to unit 17.

219
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:15,593
Well.

220
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,584
Wait until it
that I give the signal.

221
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:20,683
It is not the sorrow to make some
as much! Embark on your boat!

222
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,584
That fine wordss…

223
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:24,374
but are they sincere?

224
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,834
He, hold good.

225
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:51,953
Nami, Chopper, Coil-cook!

226
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:52,573
Hein?

227
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:54,564
As soon as I enter in scene,
run towards the boat.

228
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,743
Luffy, you will have to lengthen tone
arm to take them along to the boat.

229
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:58,673
In are you able?

230
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:00,594
No the concern.

231
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:02,413
I see.

232
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:03,533
Major.

233
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:07,094
What imports the result, I would know
to take my responsabilities.

234
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:11,404
Which dishonor it would be for the soldiers of G8 if we let them escape.

235
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:31,714
Ah, I am sorry.

236
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:34,884
What? Does not frighten us any more like Ca

237
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,673
Idiot! It came to save you!

238
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:42,903
Zut! Nami-san!

239
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:44,423
Find a means of going to the boat!

240
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,964
Allons-y, Capitaine.

241
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,673
No the district! Stop them!

242
00:14:48,674 --> 00:14:51,374
It thus had well an idea
behind the head, this underhand old man.

243
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,964
Ca fears.

244
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,353
Go ahead!

245
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:20,154
He, the guy! He is
great time to embark!

246
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,423
Are they still in life?

247
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,713
Maintaining it is with us two, Zoro.

248
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:29,044
What?!!

249
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:49,493
Do not let them slip by!

250
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:51,423
Draw to them above immediately!

251
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:53,203
But they took the hostage with them…

252
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:54,794
Draw nevertheless!!

253
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,654
Played well, Merry!

254
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:03,483
Always the same one! You thus do not go
to never stop making weak tricks?!

255
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,894
You believe that one is in
rubber like you?!

256
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:08,944
Good, the guy. One goes there, one goes there!

257
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:15,543
It is that, the boat
pirate about which he spoke.

258
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,563
He is in the train of
to sail quietly.

259
00:16:17,564 --> 00:16:19,964
Why we do not have
the authorization to attack it?

260
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,314
They took hostages on their board.

261
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:25,384
They removed a nurse.

262
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:28,213
These pirates are
really without scruples.

263
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:29,804
Is Ah, it?

264
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,414
It is it which gives the orders?

265
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:37,204
It is really anything!

266
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:38,423
The ship is it ready?!

267
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,124
One does our better.

268
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:41,033
Father?

269
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,774
Ah, Kobato.

270
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,974
It would seem that you learned
many things today.

271
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:49,204
Is it you who
their boat launched?

272
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:51,674
Do what you will want.

273
00:16:51,814 --> 00:16:54,334
You will appear in front
a cour martiale.

274
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:59,653
No father in the world can allow himself to leave his daughter adored to suffer.

275
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:01,543
Kobato-san did not fear anything…

276
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:03,654
and since
battle was committed…

277
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:07,264
You did not count nevertheless
not to give up the nurse?!

278
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:11,114
It is incredible which a major can do abstraction of the life of others.

279
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:14,724
You still have many things
to learn from the commander Jonathon.

280
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,373
Major, precisely in connection with the hostage.

281
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:22,223
Somebody informed us that it belonged to the crew of Straw hat.

282
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,394
How?

283
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,944
Please wait,
Madam the inspector.

284
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:34,814
Where do you count go?

285
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:38,184
I do not have accounts to return to you.

286
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:40,334
We, we have things to say to you.

287
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:44,634
Oh, eh well you will say
with your commander that…

288
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,324
I spent a pleasant moment here.

289
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,174
Te insane step of us!

290
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,974
It seems well that my
disguise became useless.

291
00:17:58,124 --> 00:18:00,033
Why longes you the coast?

292
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:03,343
Ca could be fatal if one
was made attack in the center.

293
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:04,963
At least from here, one will have
that a side to be supervised.

294
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:06,773
Oh, where are we?

295
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,293
Ah, be finally awaked to you.

296
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:11,283
What do I make on Merry?

297
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,164
It is a long story!

298
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:16,223
I see. Nami had been made pass
for an hostage. It was a super idea.

299
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:17,113
Obviously!

300
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:19,134
One recognizes well your
talents of arnaqueuse.

301
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,874
Who could well give
the boat with water?

302
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,693
It is surely the old man
who bump with the mechanics.

303
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:27,713
From where you know it?

304
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:29,014
It does not matter.

305
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:35,193
~ I am dazzled by the beauty of
Nami-san in its held of nurse ~

306
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,963
In spite of the fact that one is escaped…

307
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,834
I am anxious because
there is no chart.

308
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:42,433
One would have had better
to prepare before leaving.

309
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:43,373
Which band of idiots.

310
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,254
Oh! Robin-chwan!

311
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,593
Coooooooool ~!

312
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,903
Lieutenant Shepard
was thus an intruder.

313
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:54,854
We are afflicted, it east flees.

314
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:57,154
It is not your fault.

315
00:18:57,174 --> 00:19:00,634
I always had evil
with the pretty girls.

316
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:03,523
However, they are only six.

317
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,923
There is of them thus one of which
the identity remains unknown.

318
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:07,883
Yes, they is good for that…

319
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:09,273
One has just learned presently…

320
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:09,853
Yes?

321
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:11,634
After investigation with the infirmary…

322
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:15,264
That there was no disappearance
of nurse to date.

323
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,014
It is the plan of the fortress.

324
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,313
I thought that one could
to use to escape to us.

325
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,793
There is only Robin who includes/understands me!

326
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,503
Fortunately how you are there, Onee-sama!

327
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:26,924
O-Oui…

328
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:31,513
We are attacked!!

329
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:34,143
There is still an hostage. They are foutent some?

330
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:36,894
It does not matter, I imagine that they
discovered our subterfuge.

331
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,273
The other ships catch up with us!!

332
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:40,513
They do not have any hostage.

333
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,824
Pursue the crew
of Straw hat.

334
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:46,454
I repeat it, charge all
guns with the firing!

335
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:49,824
Is this the exit of this fortress?

336
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,154
Ussop, prepares the gun.

337
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,823
Chopper, retain my instructions well.

338
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:55,974
Received.

339
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:58,103
If it is the single exit…

340
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:00,414
One must find a means of passing.

341
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:02,033
However it is odd…

342
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,343
I have the impression that there is more
ramifications actually that on the plan…

343
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:05,933
and then positioning
port is false.

344
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,434
Why thus?

345
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,484
Something does not turn out badly.

346
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,594
Then anything else to announce?

347
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,364
Eh well so much better if there is nothing.

348
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:16,224
Continue like that, I count on you.

349
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:17,614
I inform you that…

350
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:20,263
the pirates are all
close relations of the door.

351
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,294
They are échecs et mats.

352
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:24,704
What a damage!

353
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,674
You are still so young,
Straw hat.

354
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:31,143
How?! There is no more
no boulet de canon?

355
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:35,543
Yes, all reserves of
powder were emptied too.

356
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,904
In there reflective, that appears obvious.

357
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:40,133
They were seized by the Navy.

358
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:44,073
What will one make? One
will not be able to pass through the door.

359
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:46,093
One will have that to sink straight.

360
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:48,773
Ca will go if one manages to take
the control of the ascencor.

361
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:50,143
Easier to say than to make!

362
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:51,714
Do not make any you!

363
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:54,003
I have an good idea.

364
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,973
Anéantissont our enemies pirates!

365
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,144
Fire!

366
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:02,294
Gomu Gomu No Fuusen!

367
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:25,973
One succeeded!

368
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,873
I see, it is not badly.

369
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,604
Nice, Luffy!

370
00:21:30,014 --> 00:21:32,684
Good, now…

371
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:37,794
“Boulets de canon and
did the powder disappear "?

372
00:21:42,604 --> 00:21:43,624
Nami?

373
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,644
Is Oh, what there?

374
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:48,623
Nami?

375
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,604
One was made have…

376
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,904
Our spoils DISAPPEARED!!!

377
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:12,863
But where they have
been able to pass, these pirates?

378
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:18,153
Impossible,
how did they can escape?

379
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:20,573
They will not flee.

380
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,553
If there is not any more gold, that
is used for nothing to flee!

381
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:24,893
A pirate who leaves his spoils
behind him is a shame!

382
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:26,563
Half turn!!

383
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:27,923
Soon in One part:

384
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,183
The boat pirates with missing!

385
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,363
2nd attack on the fortress.

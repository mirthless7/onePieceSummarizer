1
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:18,580
An island without doctor?

2
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:18,580
Venture in an island without name!

3
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,210
Island in sight!

4
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,000
An island?

5
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,470
He said 'island in sight "!
We arrived on an island!

6
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,270
He, Nami! It is not brilliant?

7
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,310
He said that he found an island!

8
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,400
Soon you will be better!

9
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,420
It is an island!

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,250
An island! An island!

11
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,860
An island! An island!!

12
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,860
Will check!

13
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,110
It is an island!

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,910
Such an amount of snow!
What a joy!

15
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,540
You do not approach, pirates!

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,120
He! Here are people…

17
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,500
But… I have a bad presentiment.

18
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,550
You them pirate!

19
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,270
You will leave this water good once for all!

20
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,800
At once!

21
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,990
We came to find a doctor!

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,400
We have a very sick girl on board!

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,300
One will not let oneself have!

24
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,070
Dirty pirates!

25
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,220
They really hate us!

26
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,790
And one has just arrived…

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,020
Close it!

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,970
They drew!

29
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,360
You will regret that!

30
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,080
Sanji-San, wait!

31
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,450
Vivi!!

32
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,160
Bandage dumbs!!!

33
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,340
Out of cheek!!!

34
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,740
Wait please!

35
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,780
You should not fight with them!

36
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,770
I am well!
Ca just scratched me the arm!

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,790
If you wish it, we will not accost here!

38
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,130
But, please, bring to us a doctor!

39
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,700
Our companion suffers from a grave disease!

40
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,000
Help it if it vout likes! I beg you!

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,010
Vivi…

42
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,300
You are a catastrophe as Capitaine, Luffy!

43
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,690
To always act without reflecting résoud not all!

44
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,840
If you fight against them,

45
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,220
what will it occur of Nami-San?

46
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,430
Forgive me.

47
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,690
I was wrong.

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,740
Please, call a doctor!

49
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,080
Please, save my companion!

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,000
I will lead you to the village!

51
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,580
Follow me!

52
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,750
You see? They included/understood.

53
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,100
Ouais… Be really strong for you, you!

54
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,160
I should warn you.

55
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,020
Our country has one doctor, a witch.

56
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,080
A witch?

57
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,230
What does that want to say?

58
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,190
This country is really odd…

59
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,730
With is the fact, which the name of this country?

60
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,940
This country does not have a name yet.

61
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,490
A country without name?

62
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,230
This kind of thing exists?

63
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,790
A bear!!!

64
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,920
Everyone, made it dead!!

65
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,430
It is a bear hiker.

66
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,510
It is not dangerous.

67
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,280
Greet it just as the mountain dwellers do it.

68
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,130
Well! Ca is better!

69
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,060
Now, I can finally begin my intensive super drive!

70
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,790
I have enough the usual musculation of it,

71
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,410
and to remain sitted to supervise the boat is tedious.

72
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,020
Thus now, it is time to go to swim in cool water to release the spirit!

73
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,350
Here is our village, Big Horn!

74
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,300
There are strange animals which walk in the corner.

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,210
What you could wait of a snow-covered country!

76
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,020
Nami-San, we reached civilization!

77
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,220
A village!

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,710
Eh well, thank you for your assistance.

79
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,790
All those which are not guard can turn over to work.

80
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,340
But, you will leave yourselves there all alone, Dalton-San?

81
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,460
They are pirates…

82
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,910
I do not believe that they want us evil.

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,710
Call that the intuition.

84
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,040
Trust me!

85
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,120
Dalton-San…

86
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,170
What does one make?

87
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,930
If Dalton-San says it…

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,930
Well, they do not need our assistance.

89
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,320
Ca must be true.

90
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,820
Yes.

91
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Well, Dalton-San, one leaves them to you!

92
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,250
Keep an eye on them, Dalton-San!

93
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,920
Call us if something occurs.

94
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,330
I suppose that they are not the armed forces of your country.

95
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,370
They are civilians.

96
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,870
You can come at home.

97
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,510
He! Look at! Luffy!

98
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,900
Another bear hiker!!

99
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,780
Still?

100
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh, Dalton-San!

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,780
Hello!

102
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,580
I heard that pirates were there.
Does that go?

103
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,340
Yes, all is under control!

104
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,650
There is no reason to worry.

105
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,520
Oh, Dalton-Kun, I impatiently await the elections in 2 days.

106
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,150
Everyone says that he will vote for you!

107
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
You… would not owe you!

108
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,730
Not somebody like me!

109
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,030
I have made too many sins!

110
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,860
Use the bed over there, please.

111
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,590
I will heat the part.

112
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,210
Forgive me not to be myself presented, my name is Dalton.

113
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,400
I am the Captain of the guard of this island.

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,690
Want excuse our hostile reception!

115
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,470
Do I can ask you something?

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,760
I believe to have already seen you some share before.

117
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,690
I think that it is your imagination!

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,670
More important, can you say some to us more on this “witch”?

119
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,420
A little earlier, the temperature of Nami-San reached the 42°C!

120
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,390
42°C?

121
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,200
Its fever has increased regularly for 3 days.

122
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,060
If it increases further, it will die!

123
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,910
Yes…

124
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,910
Moreover, one does not know the cause of the disease, nor how to treat it.

125
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,250
It is not serious! There is a doctor here!

126
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,760
Where is your “witch”?

127
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,090
The witch?

128
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,380
You see the mountains behind the pane?

129
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,990
Yes, these whores the large ones…

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,070
Mr. Hyper snowball!!

131
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,700
Shiroa, the monster of snows!!

132
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,110
I will ridge you, band of morons!!

133
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,590
These mountains are rock Drum.

134
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,430
You can see a castle at the top of largest, the central mountain!

135
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:03,780
A castle?

136
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,080
It is a castle without king.

137
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,420
Ah… good and heat!

138
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,560
Yes, I see it.

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,770
Is there something in this castle?

140
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,290
The woman whom one names witch, the only doctor of the country,

141
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,570
Dr. Kureha lives in this castle.

142
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,710
What?

143
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,680
Why did it decide to go to live over there?

144
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,430
Well, in this case, call it!

145
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,600
It is an urgency!

146
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,080
Even if we want it, we do not have any means of contacting it.

147
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,890
And it is supposed to be a doctor?

148
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,220
What is it that this kind of doctor?

149
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,800
There is not to doubt its medical competences, but

150
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,630
it is a rather strange old woman.

151
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,800
She lives since almost 140 years.

152
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,810
140? And it is still alive?

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,450
Eh well, some say that she likes Umeboshi.

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,450
Umeboshi = Prune which lengthens the life

155
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,190
But what does it occur when somebody is wounded or sick?

156
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,520
It goes down from the mountain when it wants.

157
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,570
She seeks patients, looks after them,

158
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,410
and takes what she wants in their house in compensation before setting out again.

159
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,890
An old robber would be said.

160
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,100
He He! A pirate would be said!

161
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,610
But how made an old woman to go down from this mountain?

162
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,050
It is right a rumor but…

163
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,460
Several eyewitnesses report to have seen it the nights of full moon

164
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,090
to take a sledge and to go down by the sky.

165
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,880
Therefore it is called witch.

166
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,700
They also said that a strange creature came with it. A creature like one forever considering.

167
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,200
I knew it! I knew that there was one of them!

168
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,440
An abominable man of snows!!

169
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,260
I knew that there would be one of them!!

170
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,230
A witch with an abominable man of snows!

171
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,140
Oh, please, made that they are not met!

172
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,430
She is perhaps our only doctor.

173
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,150
But, this old woman does not want relations with us.

174
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,500
All that we can make is to wait the next day when it will go down.

175
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh not!

176
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,800
Make shit! There are not time to remain here sitted and to wait.

177
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,790
During this time, Nami-San…

178
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,100
He, Nami!

179
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,730
Nami!

180
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,790
You hear me?

181
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,650
He, what you insane brothel?

182
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,830
Oh, you are awaked!!

183
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,410
Listen, you can see a doctor only if we climb a mountain.

184
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,900
Therefore, we will climb!

185
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,290
You are insane?

186
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,390
What do you want that Nami-San makes?

187
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,920
They is good! I will carry it!

188
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,340
Ca will do nothing but worsen its state!

189
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,030
What? More quickly she will see a doctor, more quickly she will be better. Not?

190
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,160
It is true but not like that!!

191
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,340
Look at how much these slopes are high and stiff!

192
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,530
I can do it.

193
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,600
Perhaps that you can but that will cause too much stress with Nami-San!

194
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,910
But even if I release it, there will be snow in lower part of us!

195
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,270
Even a person in good health would die if it fell from this mountain!!

196
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,110
Moreover, its temperature is of 6°C higher than the normal!

197
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,920
You do not include/understand it?

198
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,310
I must… better hurry be…

199
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,430
quickly by regard for Vivi…

200
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,010
Take care of me, Capitaine!!

201
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,520
Worry you!! Let make me!!

202
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,270
I knew it! When the Captain says something, its navigator goes in his direction!

203
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,530
Do you know under which condition you are, Nami-San?

204
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,460
Will that go?
This voyage will take several hours…

205
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,960
Ossan!

206
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,150
Give me meat!!
Meat!!

207
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,020
Meat?

208
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,060
Well! I go there too!!

209
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,660
Listen well, Luffy.

210
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,070
If you climb and that you tombs would be this only once, Nami will die!

211
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,160
Ah? Even once?

212
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,560
Wait! Do not move a moment.

213
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,120
I must attach that very tight!

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,670
I think that you are ready.

215
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,230
I will await you here.

216
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,040
I would do nothing but slow down you if I came.

217
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,960
Similar!

218
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,910
Of agreement!

219
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,260
Ok, Nami!! Cling well!

220
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,390
If you are really serious, I will not stop you.

221
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,000
But please, tackle the slope opposed to this one.

222
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,720
Lapahns do not live by the way over there.

223
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,030
It is a wild rabbit species.

224
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,860
If you must meet a group of it, you would die.

225
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,400
Rabbits? but we are in a hurry.

226
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,420
Ca will go!

227
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,170
Not?

228
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,610
Yes, I will strike them!

229
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,790
To strike?

230
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,720
Impossible!

231
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,250
You run to your death!!

232
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,410
Ca will go!!

233
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,700
Allons-y Sanji,

234
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,420
before Nami does not die!

235
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,180
Do not tell such doubtful jokes!! Salt bastard!!

236
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,290
Will that really go for them?

237
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,580
Eh well, not to worry for these 2 guy, but…

238
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,120
The true problem is to know if Nami-San will hold long enough.

239
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,270
I hope that they will arrive there healthy and safe.

240
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
Doesn't something go you two?

241
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,520
You should return! It is rather cold outside.

242
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,790
Ca goes! I prefer to remain outside.

243
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,020
Me too!

244
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,840
I see!

245
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,920
In this case, I will remain there too.

246
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,610
A long time ago, had we…

247
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,870
doctors…

248
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,920
But they left all.

249
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,590
They was very good doctors.

250
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,310
In truth, they could take the best possible care.

251
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,020
Then why?

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,920
This country, even less than one year ago, was devastated

253
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,920
by a crew of pirates.

254
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,080
All country?

255
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,870
This explains why you were so nervous when we arrived.

256
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,680
Exactly.

257
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,980
The citizens are not yet ready to hear the “pirate” word.

258
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,110
You must excuse their behavior.

259
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,550
It was a crew of pirates of 5 members only.

260
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,170
Their Captain was done called Black Barbe,

261
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
and with its capacity by far higher than ours, it devastated the whole country.

262
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,740
A simple crew of 5…

263
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,920
It is impossible!

264
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,540
Black beard…

265
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,460
However, some affirmed that it was well for the country.

266
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,070
How the plundering of a country can be beneficial?

267
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,630
Yes! Who could say a similar thing?

268
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,250
Thank you.

269
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,610
But it was true because until this moment,
the monarchy of this kingdom caused the loss of the people.

270
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,430
The old name of this country was the Kingdom of Drum.

271
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,120
And our king was… Wapol.

272
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,060
They was worst conceivable kings.

273
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,560
Yes! This man… I remember it!

274
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,990
Wapol?

275
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,950
The weather is increasingly cold, not?

276
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,140
The wind redoubles.

277
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,240
Buffoon! Why do you run the naked legs?

278
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,790
I have badly only by looking at you.

279
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,540
Eh well, it is right my Polisuu.

280
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,070
It is what a “Polisuu”?

281
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,120
It is your “Policy”!

282
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,120
Word game!
Policy = Insurance

283
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,540
Yes, it is that!!

284
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,220
Do Oh, you know what?

285
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,320
People, in the covered with snow countries, never sleep!

286
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,910
Ah? How is that done?

287
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,670
Because if they fell asleep, they would die.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,760
Would not be stupid! Ca does not arrive at anybody!

289
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,320
It is true! Somebody said it a long time ago to me.

290
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,820
It was Usopp?

291
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,280
Not! I heard it with the bar of my village!

292
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,760
Then why there was a bed in the house of this Dalton?

293
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,580
Ah… yes!

294
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,050
Eh well, it is for when it will die.

295
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,360
Yes, you ace reason! Softened cranium!

296
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,920
Oh, listening that!

297
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,730
The women of the snow-covered countries have all the soft skin.

298
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,770
Why?

299
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,410
It is not obvious?

300
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,630
When the weather is really cold, you must put cream. How that!

301
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,130
It is for that their skin becomes soft.

302
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,990
A soft skin, if white that it is almost transparent.

303
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,280
Here how are the women of the snow-covered countries!

304
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,550
Do Hein, how they become white?

305
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,750
Eh well…

306
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Of course because of this rain of ceaseless snow which fades on their skin.

307
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,260
Hein, you are really stupid! You know it that?

308
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,990
I do not want to hear that of your share!!

309
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,870
Moreover,

310
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,460
you start to make me shit!!

311
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,150
It is what its problem?

312
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,280
Nami-San!!

313
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,070
Hold good still a little!!

314
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,270
One will take you along in the doctor!

315
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,940
Snow is deep by here…

316
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,960
He! Luffy!

317
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,560
Course more gently, do you want?

318
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,560
You will hustle Nami-San!

319
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,240
What is it that?

320
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,430
They are large and white…
Ca must be ours polaires!

321
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,170
It is sure!!

322
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,270
You two…

323
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,900
You know Wapol?

324
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,780
Eh well, one “does not know it” not really.

325
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,140
But it was the name of the pirate who attacked our boat.

326
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,230
I fought it with force.

327
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,450
Now that I think of it, it said something in connection with the Kingdom of Drum.

328
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:50,810
Yes.

329
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,970
It rightly.
I remember it perfectly.

330
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,240
When I was child, I accompanied my father

331
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,970
with the council of the Kings.

332
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,830
I saw it over there.

333
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,610
The council of the Kings?

334
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,640
Who are you with the Juste?

335
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,740
Not, finally, I…

336
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,590
At all events, we met Wapol!

337
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,560
It was yesterday, on the way towards here.

338
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,070
Yesterday? You are sure?

339
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,500
But now, what does that mean?

340
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,560
He said that he was pirate, not King.

341
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,670
He uses piracy like a temporary camouflage.

342
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,080
Wapol derives on the oceans,
while trying to return on this island.

343
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,820
Then, people on his ship were to be

344
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,550
those which were driven out because they could not resist to the pirates of Black Beard who attacked your island.

345
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,190
To resist?

346
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,540
Not!

347
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,650
At the time,

348
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,110
the forces of Wapol did not even try to fight!

349
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,820
From the moment when it carried out the power of these pirates,

350
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,870
it immediately gave up the country!

351
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,100
Wapol was the first to be fled on the oceans and to escape!

352
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,050
It is what caused the fall of the country in despair.

353
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,920
This like that is that one…

354
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,780
Is this as that a King must act?

355
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,300
As they is dreadful…

356
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,390
A King who gives up his people…

357
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,090
Vivi…

358
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,750
Like you known as.

359
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,770
But now, the tyranny of Wapol is finished.

360
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,160
The remaining citizens linked themselves to rebuild their country.

361
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,190
Now, the thing that we fear more is the return of Wapol.

362
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
The return of monarchy.

363
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,870
With the people if little protected, we must avoid that,

364
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,940
with an aim of rebuilding a country of peace.

365
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:46,830
It jumped!

366
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,930
It is insane!

367
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,400
How can they move thus?

368
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,450
They are gorillas or what?

369
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,120
Not, they are ours polaires!

370
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,460
They are rabbits!!!

371
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,480
But you have just asked whether they were gorillas.

372
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,220
These things must be Lapahns about which Dalton spoke!

373
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,420
But… Why are they so numerous?

374
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,490
Wapol-Sama!

375
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,540
What is there, Chess?

376
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,490
Did you find the ship of Straw hat?

377
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,710
Not, Wapol-Sama.

378
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,670
We finally arrived at the house.

379
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,650
What?

380
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,900
I have wondered for how much months we derive?

381
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,810
It is our fatherland, the island of Drum!!

382
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,340
Really?

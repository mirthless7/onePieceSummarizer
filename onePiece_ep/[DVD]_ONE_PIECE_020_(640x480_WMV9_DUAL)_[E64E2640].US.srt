1
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,482
Those are cannon balls, aren't they?

2
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:58,609
Those are cannon balls, aren't they?

3
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:02,909
I missed.

4
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:04,781
What are you guys doing?

5
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:04,948
What are you guys doing?

6
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:05,198
What are you guys doing?

7
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:06,450
Cannon practice!

8
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:06,575
Cannon practice!

9
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:12,998
Amazing! You hit it with one shot!

10
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:13,874
Amazing! You hit it with one shot!

11
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:14,625
Amazing! You hit it with one shot!

12
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:15,626
Of course, when it comes to aiming,
I know everything, Don't you think?

13
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:17,044
Of course, when it comes to aiming,
I know everything, Don't you think?

14
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:19,713
Of course, when it comes to aiming,
I know everything. Don t you think?

15
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:19,922
Then you're the shooter from now on.

16
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:20,714
Then you're the shooter from now on.

17
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:20,923
Then you're the shooter from now on.

18
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:21,715
Then you're the shooter from now on.

19
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:21,840
Then you're the shooter from now on.

20
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:22,315
Come on out you pirates!!

21
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:22,341

25
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:23,258
Come on out you pirates!!

26
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:23,884
Come on out you pirates!!

27
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:24,968
That voice...

28
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:25,093
That voice...

29
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,213
What? What?!

30
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,513
Who the hell are you?

31
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:29,765
How dare you, a no name pirate,
try to kill my partner?!

32
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:32,309
How dare you, a no name pirate,
try to kill my partner?!

33
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,434
How dare you, a no name pirate,
try to kill my partner?!

34
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,143
How dare you, a no name pirate,
try to kill my partner?!

35
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:34,728
I don't know what's going on.

36
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:34,978
I don't know what's going on.

37
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:35,103
I don't know what's going on.

38
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:35,229
I don't know what's going on.

39
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:35,354
I don't know what's going on.

40
00:02:35,354 --> 00:02:35,479
I don't know what's going on.

41
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:35,604
I don't know what's going on.

42
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:35,854
I don't know what's going on.

43
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:36,730
But don't damage our shipl

44
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,272
But don't damage our shipl

45
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:37,439
But don't damage our ship!

46
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:37,481
But don't damage our ship!

47
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:37,522
But don't damage our ship!

48
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,374
Is he...

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,777
Is he stronger than I?

50
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:44,238
THE FAMOUS COOK!

58
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,003
Hey...

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,673
Where are you taking me today?

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,343
To the greatest restaurant in the world.

61
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:09,137
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

62
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:09,179
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

63
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:10,264
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

64
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:10,305
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

65
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:10,347
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

66
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:10,389
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

67
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:10,430
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

68
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,515
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

69
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:11,557
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

70
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:11,932
Don't tell me, it's in the middle of the ocean?

71
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:16,395
A toast, to your beauty.

72
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:16,520
A toast, to your beauty.

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,771
A toast, to your beauty.

74
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,529
Well, just look forward to it.

75
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:42,504
Hey, aren't you Johnny?!

76
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,882
Hey, aren't you Johnny?!

77
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,971
Zo... Zoro-aniki!

78
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,435
You're on a pirate ship, Aniki?

79
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:57,728
W-Why?

80
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:58,937
What's wrong?

81
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:00,814
Isn't Yosaku with you?

82
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:06,695
What? Those two know each other?

83
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:08,363
What's going on?

84
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,287
Y-Yosaku is...

85
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:20,459
He's i'll?

86
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:23,837
Yosaku is...

87
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,798
He was perfectly fine until a while ago...

88
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,927
Then he grew pale and started
to lose consciousness...

89
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,220
I have no clue why.

90
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,720
I have no clue why.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:31,929
I have no clue why.

92
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:36,850
Lately, his teeth started falling out...

93
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,269
And his old wounds have started to bleed again...

94
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,022
I just don't know what to do anymore!

95
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:46,652
So I took him to that rocky
island, to let him rest, but...

96
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:54,535
Then your ship attacked us!

97
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:56,203
Then your ship attacked us!

98
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,466
I-I'm sorry!

99
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,513
If all problems could be solved with an
apology, we wouldn't need the police.

100
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,058
Isn't that right?

101
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,560
Partner!

102
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:25,566
Aniki, is he... going to die?

103
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:31,321
Are you stupid?

104
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,281
Are you stupid?

105
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:33,156
What?

106
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:40,163
What are you..?

107
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,083
What're you doing to my buddy here?

108
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,751
I'll kill you!

109
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,503
Luffy! Usopp!

110
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,046
There are some limes in the storage, aren't there?

111
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:49,631
Are you listening?

112
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:49,840
Are you listening?

113
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:51,550
Bring 'em to me, right now!

114
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:51,842
Bring 'em to me, right now!

115
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:52,384
Aye, aye!

116
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:52,718
Aye, aye!

117
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:52,801
Get out of my way!

118
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,219
Get out of my way!

119
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:54,970
You get out of my way!
Hey, you're the one in my way!

120
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,513
You get out of my way!
Hey, you're the one in my way!

121
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:06,899
He's got scurvy.

122
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:08,483
Scurvy?

123
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,319
We've got him in time,

124
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,778
he should recover in a few days.

125
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:14,781
A-are you sure, Ane-san?!

126
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:16,533
I'm really grateful for Ane-san's...

127
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:20,370
Stop spitting all over me, please.

128
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:25,667
In the past, it was an incurable
disease that plagued sailors.

129
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,172
Come on, drink up...

130
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:34,134
But now, it's just a minor problem,
caused by the lack of Vitamin C.

131
00:06:34,676 --> 00:06:39,097
In the past, ships couldn't carry
enough fresh fruit to avoid it.

132
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,891
Come on, drink up...

133
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:41,767
Come on, drink up...

134
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:42,851
He should be fine now.

135
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,647
You sure are something!

136
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:48,523
Just like a doctor!

137
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:49,858
I've always known you were a smart woman.

138
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:53,487
I've always known you were a smart woman.

139
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,447
Yep, that's right.

140
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:56,531
You should of at least known what this was!

141
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:56,615
You should of at least known what this was!

142
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:56,865
You should of at least known what this was!

143
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:57,199
You should of at least known what this was!

144
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,324
You should of at least known what this was!

145
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:57,574
It could happen to you sooner or later you know!

146
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:57,866
It could happen to you sooner or later you know!

147
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:58,242
It could happen to you sooner or later you know!

148
00:06:58,242 --> 00:06:59,910
It could happen to you sooner or later you know!

149
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:13,131
It's working! He's recovering!

150
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:13,382
Welcome back, partner!

151
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:13,465
Welcome back, partner!

152
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:14,550
Welcome back, partner!

153
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,716
Welcome back, partner!

154
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:14,800
Welcome back, partner!

155
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:14,883
Welcome back, partner!

156
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:15,259
You don't recover that quickly!!

157
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,927
You don't recover that quickly!!

158
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:17,052
You don't recover that quickly!!

159
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:17,094
You don't recover that quickly!!

160
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:17,511
You don't recover that quickly!!

161
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:17,553
You don't recover that quickly!!

162
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,723
Pardon us for not introducing ourselves...

163
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:22,099
Pardon us for not introducing ourselves...

164
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:22,182
Pardon us for not introducing ourselves...

165
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:22,474
Pardon us for not introducing ourselves...

166
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,810
My name's Johnny.

167
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:27,062
And I'm Yosaku.

168
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:31,858
We are the pirate hunters!

169
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,820
Zoro-aniki used to be one of us too.

170
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:36,530
It's a pleasure to meet all of you.

171
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:38,448
I never expected to see you guys here!

172
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:38,657
I never expected to see you guys here!

173
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:38,865
I never expected to see you guys here!

174
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:38,991
I never expected to see you guys here!

175
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:39,032
I never expected to see you guys here!

176
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:39,241
I never expected to see you guys here!

177
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:39,283
I never expected to see you guys here!

178
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:39,324
I never expected to see you guys here!

179
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:39,408
I never expected to see you guys here!

180
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:39,449
I never expected to see you guys here!

181
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:39,533
I never expected to see you guys here!

182
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:39,616
I never expected to see you guys here!

183
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:40,033
I never expected to see you guys here!

184
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:40,117
I never expected to see you guys here!

185
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:40,284
I never expected to see you guys here!

186
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:40,409
I never expected to see you guys here!

187
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,618
I never expected to see you guys here!

188
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:41,743
I never expected to see you guys here!

189
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:41,869
I never expected to see you guys here!

190
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:41,994
I never expected to see you guys here!

191
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,830
But, I'm even more surprised.

192
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,875
The pirate hunter Zoro has become a pirate himself.

193
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:50,460
I guess.

194
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,170
Aniki!

195
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:00,679
Hey, partner?!

196
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,650
Let this be a lesson for us.

197
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:14,985
Yeah.

198
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,822
These kind of things can happen on a long trip.

199
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:24,870
Especially since we don't have much
room for food on this ship.

200
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:29,333
Speaking of which, we should get somebody
who'd know about this dietary business.

201
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,670
Dietary, eh...

202
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:35,923
I've got it!

203
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:37,049
We need a sea cook!

204
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:39,885
Let's go look for a sea cook!

205
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,428
I get it!

206
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,556
Then, we'd have all sorts of delicious food to eat!

207
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,060
EX-ACT-LY!

208
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:52,648
If you're looking for such a cook,
I know where you could go.

209
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,183
Yeah, that's the spirit!
So, where would that be?

210
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,112
But, it's pretty close to the Grand Line,

211
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:06,328
and the man that Aniki's been hunting
for, Hawk-Eye is around there too.

212
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:11,833
Its direction is... North-northeast!

213
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:26,657
Our destination is...

214
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,415
The Floating Restaurant...

215
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:37,985
Baratie!

216
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,783
Watcha guys think, guys?

217
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:48,078
Oh, that's a humungous fish!

218
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:49,121
Isn't it amazing?

219
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,998
It really is!

220
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,959
Amazing!!!

221
00:09:58,005 --> 00:09:59,464
W-What?!

222
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:01,884
Way out here?!

223
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,887
A marine ship?!

224
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,476
It didn't come all this way just to attack us, did it?

225
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:15,355
I smell trouble.

226
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:17,357
Just out of the blue?

227
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:26,450
I've never seen your pirate mark before.

228
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:28,577
Oh no!

229
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,914
We aren't the pirates, you know!

230
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,169
I'm the Marine Lieutenant,

231
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:39,546
Iron Fist Fullbody!

232
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,673
Hey, who's your captain?

233
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:43,425
Show yourself!

234
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:45,844
I am, Luffy!

235
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,971
I am, Usopp!

236
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,642
Our pirate mark was just made yesterday!

237
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,978
I was the one who made the pirate mark!

238
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,857
What's wrong with you people?

239
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,821
I've seen those two before though.

240
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:08,784
You claim to be pirate hunters, don't you?

241
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:09,952
W-what?

242
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:13,205
It looks like you finally caught yourselves some.

243
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,290
We are...

244
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,377
This is too good.

245
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,629
Hey, let's go now.

246
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:21,338
Sure.

247
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,218
I'll show you just what it is we pirate hunters do!

248
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,476
Now, let's head to the restaurant.

249
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:37,688
That ship is an eyesore.

250
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:39,231
Sink it!

251
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:40,399
Aye!

252
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,906
He simply ignored us!

253
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,200
We'll get back at him!

254
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,077
What's... all this?

255
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,290
These are all people with bounties
on their heads, Nami Ane-san.

256
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,171
It means that if we get 'em, we'd get the
money offered on their wanted poster.

257
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,883
Don't you think it's good business, Ane-san?

258
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,100
This is bad!

259
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:16,852
They're aiming right at us!

260
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:23,233
Leave it to me!

261
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:23,609
GOMU GOMU NO...

262
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:23,734
GOMU GOMU NO...

263
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:23,859
GOMU GOMU NO...

264
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,319
GOMU GOMU NO...

265
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:26,361
GOMU GOMU NO...

266
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:29,528
PACHINKO!

267
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,115
PACHINKO!

268
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:30,866
PACHINKO!

269
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:56,266
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

270
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:03,273
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

271
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:15,260
Honor!

272
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:17,346
Are you alright, Chef Zeff?

273
00:13:17,387 --> 00:13:19,014
Honor, are you okay?!

274
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,519
Huh? What happened?

275
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,455
Are our reservations still alright?

276
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,819
Chef Zeff, are you really alright?

277
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,863
I said I'm fine already!

278
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,118
Get back to work this instant!

279
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,246
But Honor, you're body...

280
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,208
You! Don't make me lose my temper!

281
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,961
Our only duty is to cook for our guests!

282
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:54,341
Are you trying to ruin our restaurant?

283
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:01,515
We've got him, Honor.

284
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,016
Here's the culprit.

285
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,814
I-I'm really sorry!

286
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:14,486
Ah! Your leg!!

287
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,571
You idiot!

288
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,339
This didn't happen just now.

289
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:36,842
What? Oh, it wasn't me?

290
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:44,641
However, I'm still injured!

291
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:48,812
Medical and repair bills are gonna be expensive.

292
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:53,817
I'm not gonna bargain with you on that...

293
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,236
But...

294
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,196
I have no money!

295
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:03,160
Heh... that's truly unfortunate.

296
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:08,081
If you've got no money, you'll
have to work it off then.

297
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,208
Ok, I can do that.

298
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,420
You'll have to work here for one year.

299
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:15,881
Aye! I'll have to work here for one year.

300
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:17,466
Then I will forgive you.

301
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:19,926
O-one year you say?!

302
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:24,056
By one year, you mean one whoIe year?

303
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,694
Luffy's sure taking a while...

304
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,154
Yeah.

305
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,448
How long have we been waiting?

306
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,033
Feels like a month already.

307
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,494
If he'd just change his personality,
this sort of thing wouldn't happen.

308
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:46,953
He's too honest for his own good.

309
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,722
Look!

310
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,685
Isn't that guy over there Lieutenant Fullbody?

311
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,229
He's a lieutenant of the marines.

312
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:15,357
Oh, he's so handsome and noble!

313
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,025
You're amazing.

314
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,069
Everyone's looking at you.

315
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,613
Not true, they're all admiring your beauty.

316
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:28,453
This is exquisite!

317
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,790
T-This taste...

318
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,002
This fragrance...

319
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,422
It's the fragrance of Mitqueo City, in the north.

320
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,717
A bit sour, and a bit spicy.

321
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,511
This wine is...

322
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,889
Wurzburger Stein!

323
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,643
Right, waiter?

324
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,648
Sorry, but it's not... Sir.

325
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:00,152
Your soup's getting cold.

326
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:01,653
Please enjoy it while it's still hot.

327
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,536
By the way, I'm the Assistant Head Chef, Sanji.

328
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,082
All the waiters ran away after
what happened yesterday.

329
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:22,215
Don't laugh at him!

330
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:24,343
But... the look on his face!

331
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:24,968
But... the look on his face!

332
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:25,093
But... the look on his face!

333
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,096
Discouraged..?

334
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,824
'Coz of the wine?

335
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,809
A little...

336
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,104
My tongue's a bit numb today...

337
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:38,357
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

338
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,416
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

339
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:44,071
I told the waiter the specific wine to be served!

340
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:44,112
I told the waiter the specific wine to be served!

341
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,286
What is that?

342
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,538
One week, please!

343
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,459
What did you say?

344
00:17:58,919 --> 00:17:59,920
Two weeks!

345
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:04,925
Hey now, you ruined the restaurant,
and injured the head chef!

346
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:09,888
Do you think you can make up
for that in just two weeks?

347
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,306
Then it's decided, three weeks!

348
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,434
Hell no!

349
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:20,774
NO WAY!!!

350
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:29,491
I won't!

351
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:33,161
I've waited 10 years to make myself a pirate.

352
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,496
I've waited 10 years to make myself a pirate.

353
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,375
I can't afford to stay here for one year!

354
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,286
Yosh! I've made up my mind!

355
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:45,107
I'll work one week for your forgiveness,
that's my final decision.

356
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,176
Are you really in that much of a hurry?

357
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:48,427
Are you really in that much of a hurry?

358
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,263
Then allow me to offer you an alternative solution.

359
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,389
Then allow me to offer you an alternative solution.

360
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:52,431
Then allow me to offer you an alternative solution.

361
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:52,764
Then allow me to offer you an alternative solution.

362
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:52,889
Then allow me to offer you an alternative solution.

363
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:53,098
Then allow me to offer you an alternative solution.

364
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:56,518
Instead of a year, you can give me your leg.

365
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,144
Instead of a year, you can give me your leg.

366
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:58,854
Instead of a year, you can give me your leg.

367
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:01,690
No way!

368
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:03,650
How unfortunate.

369
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:03,734
How unfortunate.

370
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:03,942
How unfortunate.

371
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,234
How unfortunate.

372
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:04,443
How unfortunate.

373
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,152
How unfortunate.

374
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,816
Waiter!

375
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,700
Didn't I tell you that I'm not a waiter?

376
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,915
But you've certainly got good taste
when it comes to your company.

377
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,668
How about it, Miss?

378
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,295
Would you care to ditch this guy
and have some wine with me?

379
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:08,006
Hey!

380
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:12,010
Does this restaurant serve bug
soup to its customers?

381
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,178
Bugs?

382
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:16,348
Then what is this bug in my soup?!

383
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,477
That should do the trick.

384
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:23,146
I'm very sorry, Sir.

385
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,523
But, I don't know either!

386
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:29,444
I'm not much of an expert on bugs.

387
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:42,833
Don't mock me!

388
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,542
Don't mock me!

389
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:04,146
If you'd just pick the bug out,
it would've been edible.

390
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:09,568
I spent three full days and nights making this soup.

391
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,403
Should you have such an arrogant
tone towards your customers?

392
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:11,445
Should you have such an arrogant
tone towards your customers?

393
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:11,653
Should you have such an arrogant
tone towards your customers?

394
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:11,903
Should you have such an arrogant
tone towards your customers?

395
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,115
Should you have such an arrogant
tone towards your customers?

396
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,453
I'm the customer!

397
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:22,039
A customer who paid you money!

398
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,540
Stop it, Fullbody-san!

399
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,416
Shut up!

400
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,544
F-Fullbody-san?!

401
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,380
Can money...

402
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:32,841
fill your stomach?

403
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,092
What?

404
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:36,094
I said...

405
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,640
Can money fill your stomach!?

406
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,479
No!

407
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:46,396
No!

408
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:47,606
NO!

409
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:54,738
Still refusing? Do you think I'd change
my mind if you keep on saying that?

410
00:21:58,492 --> 00:21:59,284
No!

411
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,662
How unfortunate...

412
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:14,216
F-Fullbody-san!

413
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:16,677
Sanji!

414
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,428
Assistant Head Chef!

415
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,048
Is this a fight or something?

416
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:31,942
Don't go ruining our food.

417
00:22:31,942 --> 00:22:34,736
Don't go ruining our food.

418
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:39,074
Messing with a cook of the sea,

419
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:39,324
Messing with a cook of the sea,

420
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:39,449
Messing with a cook of the sea,

421
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:39,491
Messing with a cook of the sea,

422
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:39,700
Messing with a cook of the sea,

423
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:39,741
Messing with a cook of the sea,

424
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:40,617
Messing with a cook of the sea,

425
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:40,701
Messing with a cook of the sea,

426
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:40,951
Messing with a cook of the sea,

427
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:45,455
is a good way to get yourself
killed... Remember that well.

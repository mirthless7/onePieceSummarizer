1
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,300
The prediction of Eneru
will achieve itself in one hour.

2
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,590
Now, there remain 25 people.

3
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,219
Seis Fleur

4
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,560
Stop!!

5
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,100
No matter what you say, it is too late.

6
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,590
Ca hurts…

7
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,939
After its victory over Yama,

8
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,030
Robin discovers Shandora,
Cité d'Or, in the middle of the ruins.

9
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,520
Moreover, it does one
unexpected discovery.

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120
This would be…

11
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,990
After having explored so many places, it remains
still of Ponéglyphes which I did not find.

12
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,470
If it is the case, then the Large one
Belfry enters the four furnace bridges…

13
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,580
perhaps tell the True History…

14
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,130
It is perhaps Rio Ponéglyphe.

15
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:55,610
Chance of survival:0%!!
Chopper VS Ohm the Priest

16
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
I am there almost.

17
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,009
If I am the first to find gold,

18
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,240
everyone will be surprised.

19
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,090
Still ruins…

20
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,319
What bell, here?

21
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,509
The ground is slightly tilted.

22
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,440
I initially will leave from there.

23
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,900
Gold, gold.

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,279
Slept.

25
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,989
Slept, Holy.

26
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,000
Holy, lying.

27
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,039
I over-estimated myself!

28
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,359
I should have turned back!

29
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,530
I am foutu!!

30
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,300
You are the third which passes
in the corner, today.

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,059
Who are you?

32
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,450
Whore, this scatterbrain
is more naive than ever.

33
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,680
It is you who put ace one
scraped in Gedatsu, isn't this?

34
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,340
He speaks about the guy about presently.

35
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,609
Oh, not. Do not make any you.

36
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,629
The world goes better without this cretin.

37
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,110
You are not agreement?

38
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,369
It is what?

39
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,660
What do I have…?

40
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,979
Pas la pains to be afraid.

41
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,549
This dog it is Holy, my adored doggie.

42
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,240
It will not bite you.

43
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,880
But, this man is
unconscious and covered with blood!

44
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,209
Holy was indeed drawn up.

45
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,060
It dead person without reason.

46
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,160
It is me which cut out this man.

47
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,649
It is horrible!

48
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,930
Who you are?!

49
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,359
Who are you?

50
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,269
I am called Ohm.

51
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,210
In any case, keep silent yourself!

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,120
Ca returns to me sad… to see with which
not the human ones are fragile.

53
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,840
You frighten me… I must flee…

54
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,100
I do not like that of the whole…

55
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,320
Of knowing that their life
is so transitory…

56
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Why people want
to always fight?!

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,640
How that?

58
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,280
They are born merry…
Seek the joy…

59
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,709
And instead of that,
they die in the combat!

60
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,310
They never would thus have had
to undertake anything!

61
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,719
People are unable
to overcome their nature.

62
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,620
It is so sad.

63
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,380
But there exists a means of saving them!

64
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,530
Everyone should die!

65
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,619
Why you say tricks
horrible like that?!

66
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,220
I do not believe in it!

67
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,400
Why did you come here?

68
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,379
I am just there for
to find a little gold and…

69
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,120
When that one seeks some
thing, to fight is inevitable.

70
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,730
I will save you.

71
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,609
To save me?

72
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,910
It is true?

73
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,470
While mourrant, you will not have anything any more
to make and more nothing to seek.

74
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,320
It does not intend to save me!!

75
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,840
Why?

76
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,910
Why everyone is…

77
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,470
carbonized?

78
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,740
It is as if they had
summer struck by the lightning.

79
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,200
Kamakiri?!

80
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,600
Kamakiri!

81
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,920
Laki?

82
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,770
Yes, it is me!

83
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,100
Leave!

84
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,430
Leave, Laki!

85
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,650
But, Kamakiri…

86
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,550
Wiper is… on the way
for the Sanctuary of God.

87
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,660
Eneru is not over there.

88
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,670
You can still stop it.

89
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,680
Stop Wiper!

90
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,160
Of agreement! About agreement, does not speak any more!

91
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,460
Nobody can overcome it…

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,100
I am the lightning.

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,390
It is invincible!

94
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,100
It is what people fear such one
god since mists of time, the lightning.

95
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,970
He is the reincarnation of God!

96
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,269
I will stop Wiper.

97
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,859
Wait here.

98
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,480
I leave the bag of Aisa at your sides.
Take care until my return.

99
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,639
Nobody can overcome it…

100
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,539
It is invincible!

101
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,079
Kamakiri is very strong,

102
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,170
but its will was broken.

103
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,710
Goro Goro is one of more
powerful Fruits of the Demon of the Logia type.

104
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,710
[Note:Goro Goro =
detonation of the lightning]

105
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,059
And Eneru has its capacity?!

106
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,660
I must stop them!

107
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,900
It already seems me to have seen that… not?

108
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,180
Perhaps well…

109
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,209
Or perhaps not…

110
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,600
If, it seems to me.

111
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,430
It is right a resemblance?

112
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
You insane of me, cretin?!

113
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,659
What?

114
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,030
It is your problem if you
am to me to eat gratos.

115
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,549
Here what arrives when one sticks to me.

116
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,780
Still want you?

117
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,520
Cretin! He!

118
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,389
Moron! Y' has anything to puff out inside!

119
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,729
Coward!

120
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,480
But where you go like that?!

121
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,800
This place is really odd.

122
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,870
Exit… Exit… Exit, where are you?

123
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,939
Exit!

124
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,230
Here!

125
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,910
A bottom of bag!

126
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,150
After all this way? It is not right!

127
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,700
Wait, perhaps…

128
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,260
And if it were a secret door?

129
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,109
I see.

130
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,850
Perhaps that if I pass to
through, I could continue.

131
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,449
Gomu Gomu No…

132
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,720
BAZOOKA!

133
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,209
Hein?

134
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,130
Ca did not even move.

135
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,030
Qu… What occurs?!

136
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,070
I sowed it. Thank you my God.

137
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,139
It is a Priest, him too?

138
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,549
There is full with hiding-places by here.

139
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,290
I must leave from here and
to find Luffy and others.

140
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,159
A epeist would have been said.

141
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,900
If I am held remotely and
remain hidden, I could flee.

142
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,959
He has me preceded sacrament.

143
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,969
This dead loss flees then
that I try to save it.

144
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,860
That shows its attachment with
life… a primary reaction.

145
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,660
However…

146
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,440
It is possible no to survive
with the Truth of the Pain.

147
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,729
The chance of survival is of 0%.

148
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,089
Ordalie of Iron!

149
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,880
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

150
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,390
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

151
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,319
Another voice disappeared!

152
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,039
Aisa?

153
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,739
I cannot remain here!
I will find Laki!

154
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,470
Remain there!

155
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,720
He, do not make the idiot!

156
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,880
Brothel!

157
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,539
I said to you to remain there!

158
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,299
And why?

159
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,039
Release me!
Release me!

160
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
Release me!!

161
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,009
It is not your problem!

162
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,910
It is not my problem, but I cannot
to let a child like you be made kill!

163
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,260
I am warlike!

164
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,600
Ouais, I ouais included/understood.
You are small warlike.

165
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,220
You do not impress me
with your black look.

166
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,029
Excuse me… You leave yourself there?

167
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,249
They is good, that goes.

168
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,069
He, stops agitating you!

169
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,879
Go up!

170
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,859
He, stops! NOT!

171
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,589
Let leave to me!

172
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,869
I must help them!

173
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,520
RELEASE me!

174
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,920
Calm yourself immediately
or I put on a snap to you!

175
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,170
And does not cry!

176
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,000
We already lost two
members of our crew.

177
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,830
I will not let myself leave!

178
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,930
Now, hurries to go up.

179
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,200
Oh shit!

180
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,079
He Ben, I flippé!

181
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,920
It is what this cave?

182
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,390
Initially this funny of tremor of
ground and then a torrent of océonimbus.

183
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,389
I failed to drown me!

184
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,319
Filth!

185
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,430

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,299

188
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,159

190
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,599
Nami-san!

191
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,950
You move towards the forest!

192
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,540
Nami-san!

193
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,499
What can we make?

194
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,280
They entered the forest.

195
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,770
Brothel.

196
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,540
Be to you coriace!

197
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,510
What?

198
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,149
Who is this?

199
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,919
Something…

200
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,150
Something approaches!

201
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,500
Goes by there! By there!

202
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,930
It is the Master of the Skies!

203
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,190
Was this Aisa?

204
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,940
One is… in the forest!

205
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,669
He, poses to me!

206
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,670
You hear me, dumb?

207
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,120
Cretin of bird. Pose to me
or I cut you the wings.

208
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,920
It is what?

209
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,079
L IT PYTHON!

210
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,350
He! Take height
or one will be made puff out!

211
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,820
Hurry! He!

212
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,459
It still follows us!

213
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,190
This snake with the furious air.

214
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,040
The Sanctuary of God is
at the top of Giant Jack.

215
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,449
Eneru will be over there.

216
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,449
I will put a term…

217
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,300
at these 400 absurd years of history!

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,880
It arrives.

219
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,629
Wiper, while still climbing
the stem of bean…

220
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,900
you will reach the Sanctuary of God.

221
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,760
Who gave you the permission to go there?

222
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,360
Ohm!

223
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,280
There is no more reason of
to go up to the Sanctuary of God.

224
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,960
Gan Fall!

225
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,040
What you insane there?

226
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,209
You would have the intention of
to recover your divine throne?

227
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,949
At all.

228
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,510
I am here to achieve my duty.

229
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,190
I return very right
sanctuary of God.

230
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,470
A tragedy… it has
completely destroyed summer.

231
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,490
Of course, there was not
no trace of Eneru.

232
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,970
It is a way of saying that more
nothing up there is useful for him.

233
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,290
These six dreadful years of
hard labor touch at their end.

234
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,240
I came here for
to present my good-byes to you.

235
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,580
What you mijotez
every both, Ohm?!

236
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,070
You say that Eneru is not
with the Sanctuary of God?

237
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,850
One of the companions of Straw hat?

238
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,769
Ca hurts!

239
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,439
I will butt it this sparrow!

240
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,800
You?

241
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,530
One would say…

242
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,820
old ruins.

243
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,020
And well, it one is crowned band
the hard ones to cook that we have there.

244
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,519
He, bring gold!

245
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,539
He well, which sadness.

246
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,450
None among you will escape
in my Ordalie of Iron.

247
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,330
If one of you is put in
through my road, I kill it!

248
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,010
You will say to me where
find Eneru and my holy guard.

249
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,740
It is what this connery of cave?!

250
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,060
He well, gentlemen, you have
all air to have to make.

251
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,060
But to achieve your goal,
you will have initially to survive!

1
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,734
Bastard, what the hell are you doing?!

2
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:58,235
STOP IT!

3
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:00,654
What the hell are you doing to my sea maps?

4
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,030
What the hell are you doing to my sea maps?

5
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,780
What the hell are you doing to my sea maps?

6
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,073
What the hell are you doing to my sea maps?

7
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:03,282
What the hell are you doing to my sea maps?

8
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,118
I don't give a crap about mermen,

9
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,328
I don't give a crap about mermen,

10
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,495
Or the sea maps!

11
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:10,122
The situation!

12
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:10,414
I don't know anything about it, but

13
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:10,915
I don't know anything about it, but

14
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:11,582
I don't know anything about it, but

15
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:14,835
I'LL DESTROY IT ALL!

16
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:15,920
GOMU GOMU NO...

17
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,587
GOMU GOMU NO...

18
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:18,873
GOMU GOMU NO...

19
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:20,966
ONO!
(Axe!)

20
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:21,217
ONO!
(Axe!)

21
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,085
ONO!
(Axe!)

22
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:33,938
NAMI!

23
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:33,979
NAMI!

24
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,233
YOU ARE MY NAKAMA!!

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,873
YAHOOOOO!!!!

26
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:59,588
SETTING OFF WITH A SMILE!
FAREWELL MY HOMETOWN, COCOYASHI VILLAGE!

27
00:02:59,588 --> 00:02:59,672
SETTING OFF WITH A SMILE!
FAREWELL MY HOMETOWN, COCOYASHI VILLAGE!

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,848
ARLONG PARK HAS FALLEN!

29
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:13,018
We're...

30
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:16,480
We're free!

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,816
We're free!

32
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,026
Everyone! We're gonna dance and celebrate!

33
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,736
Arlong Park has fallen!

34
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:26,115
We've been living for this day for eight years!

35
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,200
We've been living to rejoice upon this day!

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,450
We've been living to rejoice upon this day!

37
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,453
YEAAAHH!!

38
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:36,792
Tomorrow and the next, let's party until we drop!

39
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:39,503
Yeah!

40
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,426
Onee-chan!

41
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,387
Oh, Chabo!

42
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,222
I just had a look at Arlong Park.

43
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,391
It's amazing! It's all smashed to bits!

44
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,018
Pretty impressive, huh?

45
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:57,062
Yeah! Whoever did it must be an awesome guy!

46
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,399
Who was it? He's still here, isn't he?
The man who defeated Arlong?

47
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,859
Yeah, he's right over there.

48
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,402
Which one? Who?

49
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,195
The guy wearing the straw hat.

50
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,045
Is that really the guy who freed the island?

51
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,214
I found it hard to believe myself.

52
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,302
Meat! Meat? Isn't there anymore?

53
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,808
They're still working on him?

54
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:38,187
He looked pretty torn up, that Zoro.

55
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:40,022
Well, duh.

56
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:43,234
Any other guy would've taken a year or two to heal!

57
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:45,569
Fool!

58
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:49,114
You tried to handle an injury
this serious by yourself?

59
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,866
It hurts!

60
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,160
Are you guys really pirates?

61
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,286
Don't you,

62
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,664
have a doctor on your ship?

63
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:58,999
A doctor? Not a bad idea!

64
00:04:59,375 --> 00:04:59,959
Luffy...

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,211
But we need a musician first, right Zoro?

66
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,212
Why?

67
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,714
Because, pirates love to sing. Don't you know?

68
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:08,384
So, why is that more important?

69
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,136
Hey Doctor, where's Nami?

70
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,556
I don't see her anywhere.

71
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,474
Nami, huh?

72
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:19,478
Well, if she's not here, then she must be there.

73
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,396
Huh?

74
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,327
What's with you, Nami?

75
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,787
You're still here?

76
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:40,082
They're looking for you, your nakama.

77
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:40,249
They're looking for you, your nakama.

78
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,295
Hey, Nojiko...

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,796
Gen-san...

80
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,883
If Bellemere-san was still alive...

81
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:52,386
You think she'd stop me from becoming a pirate?

82
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:53,679
A pirate?

83
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:56,056
Are you kidding?

84
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,393
She'd never let her precious
little girl become a pirate!

85
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:00,394
She wouldn't stop ya.

86
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,186
NOJIKO!

87
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,730
And even if she did say ''No'',

88
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,274
Would you listen?

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,527
NO WAY!

90
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:12,781
Now I get it...

91
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,578
What's with you, Gen-san?

92
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:23,083
You two are without doubt, Bellemere's daughters.

93
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:24,543
Gen-san?

94
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:27,671
Nami, you've made up your mind already, right?

95
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,673
So just do what you feel is right.

96
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,009
Just like your mother did.

97
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,931
Bellemere would've wanted no less.

98
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,200
Boy, I'm full.

99
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,784
It's nice to have someone feeding me for a change.

100
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,203
It's nice to have someone feeding me for a change.

101
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,330
How's your wound, Zoro?

102
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,124
With rest and a good meal, I'll heal up soon enough.

103
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,543
That's good.

104
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,088
Seriously, why's this stupid party still going on?

105
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,798
It's been three days now.

106
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,675
Ain't that a good thing?

107
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:15,928
When you feel happy, you should
be able to enjoy yourself.

108
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:20,099
Hey Sanji! You were eating
some kind of melon earlier.

109
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,600
What was it?

110
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:23,936
What about all that meat you've
got there in your hands?

111
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,020
Oh, that?

112
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,356
It's called Namu-Hamu-Melon, because
it had Namu-Hamu on top.

113
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,316
NAMU-HAMU-MELON? Sounds tasty!

114
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,651
W-Where was it?

115
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,610
Beats me.

116
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,029
It's a potluck party for the whole island,

117
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,115
so someone must have brought them...

118
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,117
He's gone.

119
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,619
He's been eating like that for three days.

120
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:43,914
Well, my stomach's full.

121
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:45,416
So now it's time...

122
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:47,960
TO PICK UP THE CHICKS!!!

123
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,342
I'm the one who defeated the invincible mermen!

124
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,468
I'm the one who defeated the invincible mermen!

125
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:56,760
I'm the one who defeated the invincible mermen!

126
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,596
Go Go!
I'm the one who defeated the invincible mermen!

127
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:01,804
The hero who fights bravely, for the sake of love!
CAPTAIN USOPP!!

128
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:06,061
So let's sing about the exploits of the brave Usopp!

129
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:10,024
Who? Who? Who defeated the mermen~?

130
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:10,566
Who? Who? Who defeated the mermen~?

131
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,026
Man, this's so lame.
Who? Who? Who defeated the mermen~?

132
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,110
Man, this's so lame.
Who? Who? Who defeated the mermen~?

133
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,945
I thought you'd be more like,
That would be Usopp-u-chachacha!

134
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:15,404
That would be Usopp-u-chachacha!

135
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:18,991
''It's not fair! Why couldn't this happen
before my father had to die?''

136
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:19,366
''It's not fair! Why couldn't this happen
before my father had to die?''

137
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:20,576
Or something.

138
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,871
Well, I did think that, at first.

139
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:27,166
But now, I'm more concerned about my future.

140
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,751
Your future?

141
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:32,755
See, we were saved by the Straw-hat Nii-chan.

142
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:37,176
But starting tomorrow, we're gonna
have to take care of ourselves.

143
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:42,514
We shouldn't forget the past,
but it's not important now.

144
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,477
Rather, the important thing now, is the future.

145
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:50,147
What do we do from now on? What did we learn?

146
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:53,192
We are the future of this village.

147
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:55,861
That's what I've been thinking about.

148
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,281
You're too mature!

149
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:00,574
W-Why are you pinching me? What did I do?

150
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,035
W-Why are you pinching me? What did I do?

151
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,538
Man, I wanted to pick on you a little more.

152
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,039
You ARE picking on me!

153
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,041
You, you tattooed skank!

154
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,924
''Skank'' is fine by me!

155
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,053
Can it be removed?

156
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,056
Leave it to me. I've been thinking
of how to remove it.

157
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:27,685
But there will be some scarring, it's a tattoo after all.

158
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,021
That's the nature of these things.

159
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,316
I was stupid.

160
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,485
I knew I couldn't take it off.

161
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:40,197
I don't want anyone to see this!

162
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:43,409
ThIs... This awful tattoo.

163
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:47,788
The truth is... I'm not one of Arlong's nakama!

164
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:50,858
I don't want to wear his mark!

165
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:58,132
Nojiko, what's that?

166
00:09:58,257 --> 00:09:59,425
What? Oh, this?

167
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:02,636
It's nothing, just some body art.

168
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:04,847
Just like Nami, Right?

169
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,731
Hey Doctor.

170
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,442
I'd like you to make a new one for me.

171
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,444
Of this.

172
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,530
Hey, those guys can dance, too!

173
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:25,451
Song #185 of ''The Praise of Captain Usopp!''

174
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:31,582
Hey, BelIemere.

175
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:36,170
Your daughters have grown into
wonderful, strong individuaIs.

176
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,924
Just like you were, long ago.

177
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:41,926
What'd you say?!

178
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:43,802
You're joining the Marines?

179
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,846
Yeah, don't try to stop me!

180
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:47,097
'Coz I'm goin'!

181
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,725
My mind's made up!

182
00:10:51,727 --> 00:10:55,564
We'll work hard, to live our lives to the fullest.

183
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,902
We've been through so many hardships.

184
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:05,282
And so, I think I'll laugh to my heart's
content, until I look like a fool.

185
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:12,081
NAMU-HAMU-MELON!

186
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,667
Eh? There's nothing to eat here.

187
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,835
Guess I'm goin' back.

188
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:18,128
WAIT, BOY!

189
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,047
Huh? A grave?

190
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,590
Someone died?

191
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,718
Yeah, a long time ago.

192
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:26,554
Oh. That's unfortunate.

193
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,181
Then I should say, ''Gochujousama deshita.''

194
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,226
Or was it, ''Gosuchousama deshita...''

195
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:33,727
Or, ''Gotsujou...''

196
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:34,478
''Gotodou...''

197
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,230
''Goshuushou-sama deshita!''

198
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:37,606
Yeah, that '-deshita'.

199
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:43,904
Listen' boy. I know Nami's going
to sail with you, to be a pirate.

200
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,073
It's a dangerous journey,

201
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,158
I know it can't be helped.

202
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:49,743
That's okay.

203
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:54,415
But if you ever take Nami's smile away,

204
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,876
I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.

205
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:00,087
Well, I don't plan on steaIing anything, so...

206
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:02,423
UNDERSTAND?!

207
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:04,675
I got it!

208
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:08,971
Sing it again~!

209
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:13,475
Here comes song #368 of ''The
Praise of Captain Usopp!''

210
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,935
Who is it? Who is it?

211
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:21,734
The cooolest guy in the wooorld...? Usopp~

212
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:35,414
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

213
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:42,421
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

214
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,670
Wow! The food looks so delicious today!

215
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:26,173
Hey, you two, do you know what day it is today?

216
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:30,594
It's the day I first met Nojiko and Nami!

217
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,264
The day you became my daughters!

218
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,187
Hey now, stop crying.

219
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,106
It's just a storm. So what If our crops get ruined?

220
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:42,898
It's just a storm. So what if our crops get ruined?

221
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:47,278
You two need to be brave and smile, be strong girls.

222
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,991
And if you do, happy tImes will come again.

223
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:55,119
They'll definitely come.

224
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,455
Nami! Could you pass me the salt?

225
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:02,751
So you drew this sea map all by yourself?

226
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:06,130
I've been studying navigation!

227
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,965
Navigation?

228
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:09,758
It's Nami's dream, right?

229
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,346
I'm gonna sail around the world using my skills!

230
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:18,267
And then, I'll make a world map
of all the places I've seenl

231
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,897
So, this map of our island marks the
first step to your dream, right?

232
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:58,390
It's finally over, Bellemere-san.

233
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,977
It took eight long years, but we're finally free.

234
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:04,647
Me, and everyone else.

235
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:07,399
It's just like you said BeIlemere-san...

236
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,819
As long as you keep living, good
times will eventually come again.

237
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,279
It came true!

238
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,575
And now, everyone in the village is smiling,
from the bottom of their hearts.

239
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:22,039
Me? I've decided to leave the island!

240
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:25,251
Don't worry, I'll be okay.

241
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,380
They're really good people, and pretty strong, too!

242
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:34,343
For the last eight years, I've drawn so many maps.

243
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:37,263
But this is the onIy one I managed to save.

244
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:43,394
From now on, I'll only draw maps for myself.

245
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:47,898
I want to see the world! Together with my nakama!

246
00:15:49,608 --> 00:15:51,860
That's my dream.

247
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,446
So...

248
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:59,159
So, I'm not sure when I'll be coming back.

249
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:10,254
I'm going now, okay?

250
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:37,823
This is the last one, right?

251
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:38,282
Yup!

252
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,284
Everything's onboard?

253
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:41,285
Yeah!

254
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:45,581
Alright then. They've stocked us with
food. Looks like we're ready.

255
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,417
We've only been here a few days,

256
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,045
but I feel like we've made so many
memories on this island, y'know?

257
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:51,795
Yeah!

258
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,223
Aniki's, thanks. We owe you all so much.

259
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:05,684
We're goin' back to our normal
jobs as bounty hunters.

260
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,353
We'll bid our farewells for now,

261
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,272
but hopefully we'll meet again one day.

262
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,483
Take care, a'right?

263
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,693
You too, Aniki!

264
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,363
Alright, let's get going too!

265
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:19,531
H- Hey! Wait a minute!

266
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:20,866
What about Nami-san?

267
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:22,451
I thought she wasn't coming.

268
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,579
WHY NOT?!

269
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:29,375
Bastard! You said something
rude to her again didn't you?

270
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,584
Why would I do that?

271
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,294
Why else?!
I see, that's true, he's got a point.

272
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:34,046
You're trying to ge in the way of
me and Nami-san's true love!!

273
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:36,215
She doesn't have a reason to be a pirate anymore.

274
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:36,298
She doesn't have a reason to be a pirate anymore.

275
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,366
She'll be happier if she stayed here.

276
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,651
- What'd you say!?
She'll be happier if she stayed here.

277
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:39,802
She'll be happier if she stayed here.

278
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:41,303
WHAT ABOUT MY HAPPINESS?!

279
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,222
IF NAMI-SAN DOESN'T GET ONBOARD,

280
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:48,185
I LOSE 98.72% OF MY REASON TO BE HERE!!

281
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:51,230
Hey! Y'know I never found that Namu-Hamu-MeIon!

282
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:52,815
Hey, where's Na-chan?

283
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:55,693
I haven't seen her since this morning.

284
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:56,819
What did you say?!

285
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,737
She left all the money?

286
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,531
The whole 100 million beli?

287
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,117
Yeah, she left it with a letter.

288
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,661
She's not planning on bringing any with her?

289
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,414
But she worked so hard for it!

290
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,458
She said she'd just steal more.

291
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:15,754
Once she makes up her mind, there's no changing it.

292
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,423
This is ridiculous!

293
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:20,759
We didn't even get to thank her.

294
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,058
Nami-san!!

295
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:28,851
Nami!

296
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:29,602
Nami?

297
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:31,687
NAMI-SAAAAAN!!

298
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:33,272
START THE SHIP OUT!

299
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:41,989
Huh? What's up with her? She started running?

300
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:43,115
She said to set sail.

301
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,450
B-But!

302
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,664
Wait, does she plan on leaving without
hearing our thanks and appreciation?

303
00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:51,498
She can't-!

304
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:52,708
Lower the sail!

305
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:01,383
Hey, they're setting off!

306
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:04,094
Wait! We haven't thanked you yet!

307
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:08,724
Stop, Na-chan!

308
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,602
Stop right there!

309
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:14,355
This is terribly rude! I won't allow it!

310
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,233
Hey, you sure you wanna let her leave this way?

311
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:20,152
It's alright. It's her decision.

312
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:39,171
NAMI!

313
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:48,472
Why?

314
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:50,766
NAMI!!

315
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:14,623
Don't tell me?!!

316
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,084
My wallet's gone! Mine too!

317
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:18,002
Mine too!

318
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,086
Mine too!

319
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:25,926
Take care everyone!

320
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:30,723
YOU LITTLE BRAT!

321
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:34,393
Oi. She hasn't changed a bit.

322
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,770
Who knows when she'll turn on us again.

323
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:38,188
Nami-san, GOOD!

324
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,860
You li'l thieving cat!!

325
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,112
Come back here with my wallet!

326
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:46,238
You bad girl!

327
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,907
Come back anytime!

328
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,283
Take care!

329
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,285
Thank you so much!

330
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,245
BOY!

331
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,333
Don't you dare forget our promise!

332
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:04,298
Goodbye everyone! I'm off!!

333
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,053
She really did it!

334
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:12,181
Unbelievable! My sister's a real piece of work alright!

335
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,267
Have fun.

336
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:20,731
Here, Genzo.

337
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:23,400
What's this, Doctor? A piece of paper...

338
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,569
That silly girl.

339
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:28,697
She hasn't changed. She even got another tattoo.

340
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:30,950
What's this symbol?

341
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:34,787
She said it was a tangerine and a pinwheel.

342
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,583
Hey Gen-san, where did your pinwheel go?

343
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,422
No need for it anymore.

344
00:21:57,393 --> 00:21:58,227
I'm off...

345
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:06,694
Hey! Gen-san!

346
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,821
Don't get so close to Nami!

347
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:12,533
But, I only wanted to see her smilel

348
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,703
Gen-san, your face is too scary, it's making her cry!

349
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:18,330
But what can I do about that?

350
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:19,415
I got it! Maybe if I did this?
I'll just keep it right here.

351
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:22,251
I got it! Maybe if I did this?
I'll just keep it right here.

352
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:23,085
I got it! Maybe if I did this?
I'll just keep it right here.

353
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:23,235
I got it! Maybe if I did this?
I'll just keep it right here.

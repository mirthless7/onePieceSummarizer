00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:03,937
You guys were right.

177
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:04,687
You guys were right.

178
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:05,647
You guys were right.

179
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,488
I'm not as fast as I once was.

180
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:13,613
I'm not as fast as I once was.

181
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:19,327
Although with only one katana, Zoro was having
a tough time with them, yet he easily...

182
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:20,954
That man's Stealth foot is a...

183
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:22,831
That man's Stealth foot is a...

184
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,999
...silent movement technique.

185
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:30,463
Even if you had 50 assassins, he can kill
'em all without anyone noticing anything.

186
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,593
It's impossible for us to escape from his plans.

187
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,598
After three years, seeing that old habit
of his, makes my hair stand on ends.

188
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:42,642
After three years, seeing that old habit
of his, makes my hair stand on ends.

189
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,397
To avoid the ''Cat Claws'' from scratching his own
face, he always readjusts his glasses like so.

190
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:48,898
To avoid the ''Cat Claws'' from scratching his own
face, he always readjusts his glasses like so.

191
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:52,026
This proves he never forgot how to fight!

192
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:15,633
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

193
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:15,842
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

194
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:16,009
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

195
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:16,176
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

196
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:17,218
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

197
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:17,385
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

198
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,304
I've become more humble... after staying
on this island for three years.

199
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,974
I'll give you five minutes.

200
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:29,147
If you don't finish them off in five minutes...

201
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,525
Then all of you here...

202
00:07:32,525 --> 00:07:32,650
Then all of you here...

203
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:32,692
Then all of you here...

204
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:32,734
Then all of you here...

205
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:32,817
Then all of you here...

206
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:32,859
Then all of you here...

207
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:32,901
Then all of you here...

208
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:33,735
Then all of you here...

209
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:37,739
Will be killed by me!

210
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:37,864
Will be killed by me!

211
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:38,239
Will be killed by me!

212
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,364
Will be killed by me!

213
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:39,824
Will be killed by me!

214
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:50,086
Five minutes...

215
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:52,587
Ahh! We'll manage somehow
with those five minutes.

216
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,881
Ah, it's him!

217
00:07:55,215 --> 00:08:00,095
If we beat him, then we'll be
able to get past this slope!

218
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,772
The guy who's barely able to fend off our attacks...

219
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,681
We'll finish him in five seconds!

220
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,736
I'm counting on you! Nyaban Brothers!

221
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:21,366
Zoro!

222
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:26,121
What?!

223
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,958
Why you! Don't go kickin' my katanas!

224
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:32,669
Where's my ''Thank you''?

225
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,424
Thank you.

226
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,720
No useless, useless...

227
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,231
Even if you have three of 'em...

228
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,014
The result's still the same!

229
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:47,959
TIGER...

230
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,064
You guys don't get it.

231
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:56,151
HUNTING PREY!

232
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,407
Four minutes to go.

233
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:09,039
Using three swords and three
sword techniques are...

234
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:11,541
totally different things.

235
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,844
Incredible...

236
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,641
Only a single strike...

237
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:41,279
He defeated the Nyaban Brothers
with a single strike?

238
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:53,833
Don't worry!

239
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:58,880
In less than five minutes, there won't be anyone left.

240
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:01,174
I'll take care of 'em all.

241
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,605
Three minutes to go.

242
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,532
That bastard... I'll kill him!

243
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:30,954
Captain...

244
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,916
Please hypnotize me.

245
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,421
Please... Captain!

246
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:40,797
He's still alive.

247
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,674
Guess you're a bit soft.

248
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:48,596
He's probably saved by all that fat.

249
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,037
Get him, Buchi!

250
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,461
Hypnosis again, eh?

251
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,425
He's gonna be more of a pain now.

252
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,886
He tore the ground apart in his original state.

253
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,308
What is he able to do after powering up?

254
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:43,735
Chance!

255
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:47,405
I have to go and wake him up!

256
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,241
What are you going to do this time?

257
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,119
What a troublesome woman.

258
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,919
Everyone's been fighting injured,

259
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:02,170
while he's still...

260
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,592
Die!

261
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:17,560
Wake up!!

262
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:19,437
Nami!!! Watch out!!

263
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:28,446
Two minutes to go.

264
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,309
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

265
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:40,132
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

266
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,605
Wake up!!

267
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,691
Nami!!! Watch out!!

268
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:54,613
I'll split you in two!

269
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,158
Duck!!

270
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,661
What the...?

271
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:03,164
The ring...

272
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,708
Wasn't it just a tool for hypnosis?

273
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:10,196
Nami! How dare you step on my face!

274
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:11,756
Nami! How dare you step on my face!

275
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,266
Ah, he's still alive?!

276
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,355
Was it just bad timing or a mere coincidence?

277
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:38,616
Lu... Luffy?

278
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,164
Luffy!

279
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,667
That hurts...

280
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,337
THAT HURTS!!!

281
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:53,923
That guy woke up!

282
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,758
This is bad, with this...

283
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,094
There's no way we can finish 'em in five minutes!

284
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:02,264
Nami, that hurt you bastard!

285
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,475
That wasn't me!!

286
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:05,851
That wasn't...

287
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,275
Nami, your shoulder's hurt?

288
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,195
It's nothing. I'm fine.

289
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:19,740
Anyways, I've done all I can.

290
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,284
I'll leave the rest to you.

291
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:28,708
This battle... we can't lose to them!

292
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:31,794
For the sake of my treasures.

293
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:37,049
I shoulda known.

294
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:39,468
Go for it!

295
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,637
For the sake of my treasures.

296
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,640
Yosha! That is your style.

297
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:48,602
One minute to go.

298
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,815
This is impossible!

299
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,443
Capt' Jango and Buchi-san wouldn't make it in time!

300
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:58,779
There's just no way we can finish
'em off in one minute!

301
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,964
Buchi, no time to play around!

302
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,263
You take care of that guy with the waistband,
and I'll take care of this weird kid.

303
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:32,480
You with the straw hat!

304
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:41,739
It's about time to kill everyone.

305
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:58,506
What? That evil caretaker's here too?

306
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,675
That bastard...

307
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,803
Didn't he fall off the cliff and die?

308
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,139
That's fine...

309
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,404
Don't even think of...

310
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,450
Sneaking up on me!

311
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:29,370
Kaya!!

312
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,472
Usopp-san, are you alright?

313
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:51,058
Kaya, what're you doing here?

314
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:54,145
I'm sorry, Usopp-san.

315
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:56,856
I know that you might never forgive
me for what I have done.

316
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,358
I just cannot believe that...

317
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:02,537
Ku... Kurahadol is a pirate.

318
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,030
That doesn't matter now!

319
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:05,781
Why did you come here?

320
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,742
I told you to run away!

321
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:10,119
He wants to kill you!

322
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:13,706
But, aren't you fighting?!

323
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,919
I did such a horrible thing to you.

324
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,256
Yet, you're hurt all over and still fighting.

325
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,341
That's why...

326
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:24,508
Kaya-ojousama...

327
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,179
Why... are you here?

328
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,434
Please stop...

329
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:40,441
Please stop this, Kurahadol!!

330
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,157
Meri told me everything.

331
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,116
Meri told me everything.

332
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:49,742
Meri told me everything.

333
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:57,375
Isn't that the lady of the house?

334
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,920
So that's the final target of our plan?

335
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,087
So that's the final target of our plan?

336
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,589
So then, now we don't have to
go to the village anymore?

337
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,883
We just need to kill that girl, right?

338
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:10,554
Kurahadol, I beg of you!

339
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:13,391
If you want my fortune, I'll give it all up.

340
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,893
So please, leave this place!

341
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:17,186
Right now!

342
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:21,107
I thank you for the offer... however...

343
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:27,238
There's one other thing that I desire.

344
00:18:29,156 --> 00:18:31,117
What I desire is...

345
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,329
The tranquility of my soul.

346
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,123
Tranquilty...

347
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:42,294
Yes, all I want is tranquility.

348
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:47,174
I've spent three years to gain
the trust of all the villagers,

349
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:51,846
which made me feel unbelievably comfortable.

350
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:58,811
Therefore, I'd like to keep this sense
of tranquility with me forever.

351
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:07,611
Therefore...

352
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:14,493
Therefore I must obtain this tranquility
and your fortunes!

353
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,371
That means the pirates will attack this village!

354
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,709
Then...

355
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:24,712
You will leave a will and die!

356
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:28,883
These two terms are absolutely necessary.

357
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,218
N... no... he's...

358
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,764
Not Kurahadol.

359
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,265
Run!

360
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,268
Run because anything you say to him is useless!

361
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,519
Run!!

362
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:43,230
He's not Kurahadol!

363
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:45,733
He's not Kurahadol...

364
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:47,943
Kaya...

365
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:54,408
Leave... this village!

366
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,787
Oh, you're actually pointing a gun at me.

367
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,915
Leave now!

368
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:03,209
So that's how it is...

369
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:07,505
You've grown a lot these past three years,

370
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,132
Kaya-ojousama.

371
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,219
Do you still remember?

372
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,806
Many things have happened
in these past three years.

373
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:21,978
Since the time when you'd always lay in bed,
crying for your parents whom passed away.

374
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,923
It's really been quite a while.

375
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,776
A long time...

376
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:38,327
I still remember... the sorrowful and
joyful days we've spent together.

377
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,205
K... Kurahadol...

378
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,542
We went shopping together.

379
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:48,045
I nursed you when you had fevers.

380
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:52,341
You were so happy listening to anything I'd say.

381
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:58,306
I gave my all for you.

382
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,810
I have always... yes, always...

383
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:05,521
Endured it.

384
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:09,483
Yes, everything was so that...

385
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,530
I can kill you one day... Today!

386
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:25,166
I, formerly known as Captain Kuro,

387
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,961
had to keep a smile for a little girl
whose nose always sniffled.

388
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:34,467
No matter how much I hated it,
I tried hard to make you happy.

389
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,349
Bastard...!

390
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:45,186
Can you imagine, my humiliation of those days?

391
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:50,858
Can you imagine me, the former Captain
Kuro, doing such things?!

392
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:01,619
KURO!!

393
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,919
Come to think of it, you still...

394
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:15,633
You still owe me a punch in the face.

395
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:17,510
Usopp-san.

396
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:21,597
You hit me pretty hard that time.

397
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:52,128
Since you hate it so much, I'll give
you a hundred more for free!

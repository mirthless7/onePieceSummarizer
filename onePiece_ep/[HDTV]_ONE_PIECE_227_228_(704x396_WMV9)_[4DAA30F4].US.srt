1
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,350
He Chopper. Did you find plantes médicinales?

2
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,810
I found much of it. This island is filled with rare plants.

3
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,770
There is a thing which disturbs me since one moment…

4
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,990
Which is this strange line?

5
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,720
Can it is true, what that be well?

6
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,930
It would seem that a cyclist passed by there.

7
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,660
We found a zone cleared.

8
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,040
A tanuki?

9
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,040
[Tanuki:left raccoon]

10
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,720
I am a reindeer! Look at my horns!

11
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,070
You are well, Chopper?!

12
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,470
Who it is this guy?

13
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,300
Doesn't something go, Luffy?

14
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,400
Who are you?

15
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,110
Who you are?!

16
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,710
It is which this giant?

17
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,480
Who is this man?

18
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:02,940
Robin!

19
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:12,300
The admiral of the marine base, Ao Kiji!

20
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:12,300
The threat of a great power!

21
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,280
To be able to disturb Robin like that…

22
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,710
Who is it?

23
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,070
It is a navy.

24
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,890
The admiral of the marine base, Ao Kiji.

25
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,500
Admiral?!

26
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,180
Admiral? A so high rank?!

27
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,040
There exist only three men who have the title of Admiral

28
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,050
Aka Inu

29
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,050
(the red dog)

30
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,450
Ao Kiji

31
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,450
(the blue pheasant)

32
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,190
Ki Zaru

33
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,190
(the yellow monkey)

34
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,900
Only the admiral commander-in-chief, Sengoku, can give them orders.

35
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,220
He is one of the three plus great powers of the government!

36
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,480
How is what a guy like does to him here?!

37
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,360
You did not find pirates more famous than us?! See elsewhere if not…

38
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,160
Alalala?

39
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,020
C… It is what?

40
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,450
A novel method of dredger! Hello.

41
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,010
How is what you insane, jerk?!

42
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,960
Pay attention so that you say!

43
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,770
He, of calm the guy.

44
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,390
Did you listen to what I said?

45
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,270
I said only that I trotted myself. You do not ignite.

46
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,950
Summers you… this… good…

47
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,910
“It”?

48
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,720
“Good”?

49
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,720
I forgot… It is not serious.

50
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,220
Your sentences do not have any direction!

51
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,190
It is which him? He, Robin, be sure for you that you were not mistaken in guy?!

52
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,810
It is impossible that he is admiral of navy!

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,040
He He, does not judge people by their appearance.

54
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,120
My currency of navy is “a lazy justice”.

55
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,930
THERE IS ALREADY REMARK!

56
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,870
In any event… good…

57
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,460
Ah, forgive me.

58
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,220
I am tired to remain upright. Yokkorasho.

59
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,060
(Yokkorasho is said when a thing is tiring to make)

60
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,060
Then, why did you sleep upright?

61
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,720
To make short… I by no means intend to capture you, are without fear.

62
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,400
I just came to confirm the position of Nico Robin after the incidents of Arabasta.

63
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,020
As envisaged, it is with you.

64
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,560
It is really lazy.

65
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,390
It is at least equipped like an admiral.

66
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,060
I will announce only this to the general headquarters.

67
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,880
Because by adding the settings at price, the total reward increases.

68
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,400
100 million more….

69
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,290
60 million more…

70
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,990
79 million, that made…

71
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,740
I know anything of it… I lose myself in my accounts…

72
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,320

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,600
He wait! Wait, Luffy!

75
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,830
Stop! Stop!

76
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,130
Come here! It is what your problem…?

77
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,190
What good is it to attack it?!

78
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,150
- It is one of most powerful the navy!
I of insane!

79
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,360
We will let it capture Robin?! Species of bastard!

80
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,050
Aiaa… As I already said, I will not do anything.

81
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,300
I go you botter the bottom!

82
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,730
Stop that, Luffy!

83
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
Wait!

84
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,980
It is a navy? So only they had said it earlier…

85
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,010
Who are these people?

86
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,470
He, did not fear.

87
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,540
Wasn't this island, uninhabited?

88
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,520
Not.

89
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,550
They are probably the passengers of the shipwreck who failed themselves on this island.

90
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,400
I had echoes of a report/ratio mentioning these shipwrecked men in the surroundings.

91
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,840
How are they, Chopper?

92
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,050
They underwent wounds but their days are not in danger.

93
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,860
They will be left there if they follow my regulations.

94
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,400
But they have not eaten anything for six days. They are very weakened.

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,950
Sanji-kun and Ussop went to seek to eat presently.

96
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,230
He! One is there!

97
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,360
They were really hungry.

98
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,380
Do not eat so quickly.

99
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,330
still let us have we much food.
- Yes, we have much of it

100
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,430
Why do you eat?

101
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,020
Although this island is uninhabited, it is not difficult to find food.

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,190
Ca was not to be easy if you did not have any experience.

103
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,840
You were lucky sacrament to survive a shipwreck on Grand Line.

104
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,020
We are the only survivors having been able to reach this island.

105
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,790
What did it occur?

106
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,450
We were of return of a culinary visit to Pucchi, the Greedy City.

107
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,510
Then the boat was struck by an enormous frog which swam the crawl and broke.

108
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,560
A frog which swam the crawl?!

109
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,920
Don't the frogs, usually swim the pitch-stirrer?

110
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,530
Ca must be brilliant! I want to see that!

111
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,830
You are sure?

112
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,750
It is true!

113
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,530
It was Yokozuna.

114
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,560
[Yokozuna which is the name of frog means in Japanese:Sumo champion]

115
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,560
Yokozuna?

116
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,790
We then fought for finally reaching this uninhabited island.

117
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,200
We had awaited our rescue for one month…

118
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,980
But whereas we thought that somebody arrived, we did not believe our eyes of them.

119
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,880
It rolled to bicycle on the ocean.

120
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,410
Could He He, how a bicycle…?

121
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,370
Ah, it was me.

122
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,320
Arrived then a pirate boat.

123
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,730
It was us.

124
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,600
Then you “this”, isn't this is?

125
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,300
Good… Hum… It…

126
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,920
Express yourself clearly! Clearly!

127
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,480
It is true! I forgot! He, stops you saying conneries!

128
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,020
L… Luffy! Wait, wait!

129
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,920
Calm yourself!

130
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,220
Not, but…

131
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,170
As I already said, I did just one strolls.

132
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,940
What, one strolls?! Then does not remain there! Break!

133
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,760
It is not reasonable.

134
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,130
At all events, Luffy wants some…

135
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,260
Ok, I go there.

136
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,730
I return, but before that…

137
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,650
You all… Prepare you to leave…

138
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,710
By chance, I know an inhabited island not far from here.

139
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,540
It is preferable that you are neat over there.

140
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,120
He! You! Do not listen to it! It is a navy!

141
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,110
Where is the problem?

142
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,420
Ahh, they is not false! Normally, the navy are the nice ones and we are the malicious ones, isn't this?

143
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,880
Do not laugh!

144
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,430
Will it help them?

145
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,290
Does it have a boat initially?

146
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,380
There was no boat in the neighborhoods, except ours.

147
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,340
Without boat, nor log book…

148
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,070
How will they join this close island?

149
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,310
Ah, all is ok.

150
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,140
You are not at all convincing.

151
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,050
It is possible…

152
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,090
Thanks to the capacities of this man.

153
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,670
Here, it is ready.

154
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,840
We sufficiently responsible it for food and water for ten people.

155
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,290
It is not in your practices to make the things with half.

156
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,750
Yes, it is our strong point! You surely realized some.

157
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,550
It is honest after all.

158
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,280
What will you make? Do you hope them to trail, them and the loading, with the stroke?

159
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,830
As if I of it were able.

160
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,370
You move away a little.

161
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,210
It is what?

162
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,170
A monster! Probably the Master of the places!

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,130
That?! He! Run away yourself!

164
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,130

170
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,460
Ca should last one week, I think.

171
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,460
You can walk prudently in this direction.

172
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,210
You will reach the inhabited island within four days.

173
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,380
The weather will be cold. You equip with warm clothing.

174
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,310
Do I dream?

175
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,760
The sea became solid!

176
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,480
We can now cross the sea! We can leave this island!

177
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,320
Admiral-san! Thank you!

178
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,050
It is a miracle! It is a true miracle.

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,790
Here, we are about to leave.

180
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,410
Ah…

181
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,980
You had chance.

182
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,340
Made good voyage.

183
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,060
All the pirates are not the same ones.

184
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,090
How to thank you?

185
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,020
Not only you looked after us, but moreover, you shared your food.

186
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,860
Do not make any you for that.

187
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,630
To help your next improves your destiny, you know.

188
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,000
Made attention that the children do not catch cold.

189
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,840
Food will be preserved as much as the weather will be so cold.

190
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,850
Thank you very much!

191
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,050
I will not forget your gesture.

192
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,280
Pirate with the straw hat!

193
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,240
Goodbye! Take care of you!

194
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,460
It is brilliant, brilliant.

195
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,600
The weather is cold, very cold…

196
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,280
It is the winter here.

197
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,640
I can make iceskate!

198
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,480
Excel, Chopper!

199
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,540
A winter island, that then!

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,370
What is there?

201
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,850
Stop!

202
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,000
I am cold, I am cold!

203
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,320
I am frozen.

204
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,670
What is there?

205
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,240
How would I say…? You are exactly like your grandfather.

206
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,850
Monkey D. Luffy.

207
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,500
I became insane…

208
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,100
Or am I right?

209
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,120
Grandfather?

210
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,840
The grandfather of Luffy?

211
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,320
What doesn't go Luffy? You perspire.

212
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,150
Not… This. it is nothing… really… good…

213
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,280
A long ago, your grandfather me because much of problems.

214
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,470
I came here for Nico Robin and…

215
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,430
In order to know you.

216
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,670
Perhaps I would have…

217
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,340
To kill you immediately…

218
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,870
The government yet really does not know which you are, but…

219
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,100
By studying your last respective, one realizes danger which you represent.

220
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,250
Although you are little, this gathering of gangsters…

221
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,690
Is tedious.

222
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,710
First setting at price on your crew…

223
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,680
Until your death warrant here…

224
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,480
Your progress was amazing.

225
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,890
Up to now, you were confronted only with criminals, but…

226
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,650
That made to you more dangerous.

227
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,210
Why you say that of a blow?! Presently, you said that you were there to only confirm.

228
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,200
With the result that your crew is regarded as dangerous now…

229
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,570
It is you… Nico Robin.

230
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,660
He you! You tracked Robin! I go you botter the bottom!

231
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,500
Its setting at price does not reveal only its force…

232
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,080
It also represents the threat which it inflicts with the government.

233
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,980
This is why…

234
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,520
Although you were only eight years old, you gained a setting at price of 79 million.

235
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,410
You made certainly well comprise you a such child.

236
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,270
You betrayed your partners…

237
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,900
And be been useful to you of them like toys.

238
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,300
To survive in a medium of shadies…

239
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,270
Was single only to serve your own interests.

240
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,230
Which blow schemes you in this new team?

241
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,510
He, you!

242
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,150
All that you say tends to irritate me!

243
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,920
What reproaches you in Robin-chan?!

244
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,520
- Stops, Sanji!
I do not have anything in particular to reproach him.

245
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,100
If I do not have any maintaining contact with it…

246
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,840
It is because it slipped to me between the fingers once.

247
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,700
It is an old history.

248
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,560
You will realize there also, a day or the other.

249
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,160
When you have to make with a suspect woman…

250
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,600
The time of the regrets is already far.

251
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,780
And for you to prove it…

252
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,750
All organizations that Nico Robin could infiltrate…

253
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,780
All were destroyed…

254
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,170
Excluded it.

255
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,780
This is not…

256
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,110
Nico Robin?

257
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,660
You, you stop that! The past does not have any more importance!

258
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,330
If the past were not forgotten…

259
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,250
How could we travel with a kind of hunter of pirates and a kind of robber?!

260
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,110
“A kind” was not necessary!

261
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,620
It is not the past, but the present which imports me!

262
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,810
Now, Robin is an invaluable companion!

263
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,400
Do not speak like that about our companions!

264
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,250

265

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,530
Nami-san!

350
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,170
I will not allow myself…

351
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,140
To make as good seems you!

352
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,670
Wait, the guys!

353
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,920
You do not occupy of that.

354
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,010
I will undertake some all alone.

355
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,240
Let us stop…

356
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,020
You and me! With against one!

357
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,440
Ca is equal for me, but…

358
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,830
I gain nothing there to capture you…

359
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,800
I thus will kill you.

360
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,660
Does it breathe… Not it cannot…

361
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,100
It is probably choking itself.

362
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,630
Then it will die if one does not hurry?

363
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,110
But it will break if we heat it too quickly.

364
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,570
We must restore the internal temperature of the body.

365
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,140
Will it be left there while making like that?

366
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,740
I do not see other solutions.

367
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,410
How can you not be sure?!

368
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,420
The life of Robin is in danger!

369
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,360
But I was never confronted with human frozen before!

370
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,610
Ao Kiji said that it was still alive…

371
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,290
- But I have evil to believe in it!
- Does not despair!

372
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,460
If you can nothing make, nobody other can it!

373
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,930
You are the doctor of this ship!

374
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,680
I KNOW IT! A LITTLE SILENCE PLEASE!

375
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,580
Chopper!

376
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,630
What? You are only three?!

377
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,150
I will tell you later!

378
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,740
We will go back there!

379
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,410
But initially, do something for our arms and our legs cold!

380
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,790
Aah, of agreement.

381
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:23,880
Hum…

382
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,790
You must immediately dissolve the hardened zones!

383
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,570
But the shower is occupied by Robin.

384
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,920
Is Robin well?

385
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,270
I have doubts…

386
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:34,940
What?

387
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,770
Is they good like that?

388
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,310
Once all melted at low temperature, go up on the boat to mass you the members!

389
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,500
Nami, helps me for Robin!

390
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,650
What do you make there? Where are Luffy and Ao Kiji?!

391
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,570
They fight with against one.

392
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,970
Against one?! You left it all alone?!

393
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,000
It is an order of the captain.

394
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,700
You cannot do that, even if it is an order of the captain!

395
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,640
How can you be also cruel?! Luffy is…

396
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,320
Keep silent yourself!

397
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,390
It is a combat with against one! You do not include/understand?!

398
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,630
STOP NOW!

399
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,870
The moment is critical for us all.

400
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,640
If it is still one of its whims…

401
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,240
We must expect worst!

402
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,190
As I suspected it, you are not like the others.

403
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,720
GOt (310,560, \ fs72)}DRIVEN {\ R} {\ T (560,770, \ fs72)}GO {\ R} {\ T (770,920, \ fs72)}DRIVEN {\ R} {\ T (920,2090, \ fs72)}NO

404
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,990
STORM

405
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,690
ICE 

406
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,140
Let us stop you and me, against one!

407
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,230
Good blood, I was made berner.

408
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,960
By accepting this combat with against one…

409
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,050
Only one gains, and it, isn't is finished?

410
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,400
If I put the hand on the others…

411
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,750
It would be dishonest person of my share. Isn't this Captain?

412
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,170
Or…

413
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,290
Did you really think of being able to beat me?

414
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,740
Let to me say a thing

415
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,620
In a near future…

416
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,600
This woman will become unverifiable.

417
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,250
You will be overpowered by the curse…

418
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,260
That Nico Robin carries since his birth.

419
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,400
Here what arrives when a woman such as it…

420
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,950
Go up on board a ship…

421
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,870
Monkey D. Luffy!

422
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,940
Ca does not pose any problem for me to explode to you now…

423
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,850
I have a debt towards you however.

424
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,180
From share your victory over Crocodile, I pass sponge.

425
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,450
And…

426
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,830
Heu. Forget that…

427
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,830
Still a connery of Smoker.

428
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,970
With more.

429
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,920
Here it is!

430
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,900
Luffy!

431
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,450
It is still whole!

432
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,850
It is a good thing.

433
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,650
Let us bring back it…

434
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,540
Quickly with the boat!

435
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,610
Stop repeating what I say!

436
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,670
According to this log book…

437
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,550
Their next destination will be…

438
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,720
Seven toilets…

439
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,510
The city of water.

440
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,530
Alalala!

441
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,050
They approach the general headquarter more and more.

442
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,110
Ooops, sorry!

443
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,370
Their heart…

444
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,670
Are…

445
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,470
Given to beat!

446
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,880
Yatta!

447
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,640
- Luffy!
- Robin-chan!

448
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,540
Not, not yet! If you return, you will make noise too much!

449
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,540
Ok, Dr. Chopper.

450
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,990
I can be useful to you?

451
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,040
But… you know… To call me Doctor does not return to me especially content!

452
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,290
Ah! When they awake, an hot drink would be ideal.

453
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,210
I will then install them in the room of rest.

454
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,250
Yes yes, Sir!

455
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,430
Nami, does one have to hoist the veils?

456
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,660
We will not leave with a captain in such a state.

457
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,830
The route is ready, but remain here for the night.

458
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,570
What is there, Ussop?

459
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,880
You are burst?

460
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,880
Of other guys as powerful as him…

461
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,370
Now will leave to our research?

462
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,550
All of which I was able was to run while shouting.

463
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,610
Lie down, baka.

464
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,270
You are just tired.

465
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,680
In order to grant a little respite to Luffy and Robin…

466
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,840
The Merry Vogue dropped anchor during four days.

467
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,720
A little later we hoisted the veils…

468
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,910
And we have sailed thus for three days.

469
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,830
The sky is blue, and one would believe oneself in spring.

470
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,460
And sometimes even in summer.

471
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,150
What a splendid weather!

472
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,270
Nami-swaaan!

473
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,370
I prepared you some potatoes in straw, Miss.

474
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,420
If you want it well.

475
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,610
Delicious!

476
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,180
I am happy!

477
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,160
Make less noise, I do not manage to sleep.

478
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,590
Yeah, yeah, afflicted, Mr. Cactus.

479
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,680
What you said ace, poor eyebrows!

480
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,580
How you called me?!

481
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,880
Poor eyebrows.

482
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:46,910
Lu-ffy there! Lu-ffy there! Lu-ffy there!

483
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,480
awaited we so much!
- Luffy!

484
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,230
Me, in intimidation….

485
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,150
Me, but frozen.

486
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,480
How can it still do that after having failed to die frozen?

487
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,980
- How was it?
- It was exactly like that, Luffy!

488
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,440
Clean to me all that, Luffy!

489
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,680
Hein? Do Nami, what you eat?

490
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,520
Straw. They are potatoes.

491
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,330
Potatos?

492
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,040
I am hungry, me too! He, Sanji!

493
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,600
How long do you have to sleep to be able to be satisfied?

494
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,810
Deal with your business! You want to fight?

495
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,850
Ok ok, that is enough!

496
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,560
Sanji-kun, the captain wants a little straw.

497
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,550
Ouuiiii, Nami-swaan!

498
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Sanji, of potatos, potatos!

499
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,430
Even in convalescence, you remainders always the same one.

500
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,000
Ca is called “straw”, delicious.

501
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,600
Why “straw”?

502
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,000
“Straw” is the meat of the tail of an enormous monster called Paille.

503
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,000
(Actually, Paille refers to the straw hat. Potatoes in straw = fried)

504
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:09,080
I killed it. It made at least 100 meters length.

505
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,550
Hundred meters?!

506
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,120
It is giant, Ussop!

507
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,060
And it was right before the breakfast.

508
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,060
(Japanese Way to say “it was cake”)

509
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,670
Did you rise early to kill it?

510
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,950
Am Chopper, how I called?

511
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:28,180
- Ah yes, it is… Ca-captain…
- But of course! My name is Captain… Usso…

512
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,330
Robin.

513
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,180
Robin-chwan!

514
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,110
Robin!

515
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,380
How do you feel you? Do you have shivers?

516
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,340
I am well, thanks to you.

517
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,150
Thank you, Doctor.

518
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:55,080
You know… Even if you call me Doctor, that does not return to me more content!

519
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,750
It with the content air.

520
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,370
Yes.

521
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,730
Do not exhaust you, Robin.

522
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,620
Direction not guilty not to be itself as energetic as Luffy.

523
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,970
You can still rest.

524
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:07,950
Do not take that like a compliment!

525
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,400
Robin-chan.

526
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,800
Do I have to prepare you something of heat?

527
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,280
Did you find the appetite?

528
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,910
Then…

529
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,860
Do I can have a little coffee?

530
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,350
Ouuiii! With pleasure!

531
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,290
It is what that?

532
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,910
I cannot prevent myself from eating the straw of Sanji-kun.

533
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,910
Delicious!

534
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,940
With which temperature is cooking?

535
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,090
He, Luffy!

536
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,860
A frog which swims the crawl!

537
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,910
What?

538
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,980
Make the turn and come to see!

539
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,170
Really?

540
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,190
A frog? You want to say “this” frog?

541
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,160
He Luffy. Do you still believe what this stupid admiral says?

542
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,390
It is impossible that a frog which swims the crawl…

543
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,230
Can EXIST!

544
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,370
This frog swims the crawl!

545
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,930
Let us follow it!

546
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,070
Yes!

547
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,550
Tighten the veils! Leave the oars! Follow this small beast!

548
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,630
Yes!

549
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,830
More quickly!

550
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,500
I do not know what it is, but I want to know!

551
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,060
Afflicted to have made you wait, Misses.

552
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,140
What was it?

553
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,420
What does it occur?

554
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,770
It would seem that the boat changes direction.

555
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,870
He, you!

556
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,230
Why we change direction?!

557
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,410
One located a large covered frog of scars!

558
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,270
What do you want to say?

559
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,960
One will make a barbecue of it!

560
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,390
You want to eat that?!

561
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,720
It is true…

562
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,100
Would this be a headlight?

563
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,040
Why this headlight over there?

564
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,870
Does Y' have somebody over there?

565
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,150
It is what, an island?

566
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,670
It is a headlight. This place was not envisaged on the Log Poses.

567
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,760
And the frog?! In which direction does go it?

568
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,580
Not question!

569
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,290
The frog moves towards the headlight.

570
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,010
Initially, to pass frog to the miller with white wine…

571
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,130
Then to coat it with flour and to fry it.

572
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,710
He, Sanji-kun!

573
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,110
If the captain said it, we, isn't this must go there?

574
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,940
Robin.

575
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,330
Yosha!

576
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,810
Any power!

577
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,960
Yes!

578
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,860
Why you pass all its whims to him?!

579
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,250
It flies!

580
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,200
Do not let it escape!

581
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,080
Row in its direction!

582
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
Something was run up against.

583
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,170
Are Nami-chan, Robin-chan, you well?

584
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,560
To some extent, yes.

585
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,600
I am well.

586
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,520
Pfiou, they is good.

587
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,610
It is what this noise?

588
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,450
What does it occur?

589
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,970
Did not say to me that it is…

590
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,330
What does this trick make here?

591
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,180
Half-turn, half-turn! Turn to 180 degrees!

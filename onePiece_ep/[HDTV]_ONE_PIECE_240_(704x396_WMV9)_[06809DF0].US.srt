1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,709
Did Naaa, you want to speak to me, pirate young person?

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,210
I came to know the truth!

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,880
Last night, I saw Nico Robin of my own eyes.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,640
And it is a member of your crew. Here is the truth.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,260
It was really Robin?!

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,410
Keep silent yourself.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,010
You do not inspire any more confidence to me.

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,700
If I made you call, it is because I have a thing to ask you.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,200
Let meet Nico Robin once again to me.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,989
Breaking news!

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,540
The culprits in the attack of Iceberg-san are the crew of Straw hat!

12
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,030
Soon in the Mizu-Mizu newspaper, the accounts of eyewitnesses!

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,510
I repeat.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,730
Let meet Nico Robin to me.

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,130
It is impossible.

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,000
We do not know where Robin is.

17
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,560
A shot!

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,830
Ca comes from the room!

19
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,970
Iceberg-san!

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,870
You… You are well?

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,810
Yes.

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,910
I believed capacity to bring me closer to the truth.

23
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,540
Stop all the members of the crew.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,670
With your orders!

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,150
He, Luffy.

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,350
You spoke with Iceberg-san?

27
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,649
Ouais. He said that he had really seen Robin.

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,560
Impossible. Why would Robin have done that?

29
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,880
I do not believe a mot. of them.

30
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:25,410
Eternal good-byes?
Nico Robin, the woman vêtue of black

31
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,469
One arrived! Hurry, Kokoro grandmother!

32
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,610
Calm yourself.

33
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,569
Toilets 7, that made a lease.

34
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,889
Grandmother, hurries! Quickly!

35
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,250
Ouais, ouais.

36
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,210
Passengers of the train of the sea. The wearing of mask is prohibited.

37
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,009
Passenger, show your face please.

38
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,370
But it is my face.

39
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,250
He you.

40
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,319
Kokoro-san, which surprise.

41
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,669
It is what all this agitation?

42
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,280
Yes. We seek the crew of Straw hat, those which tried to assassinate Iceberg-san.

43
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,210
Assassins of Iceberg-san…

44
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,150
It is what?

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,490
These people-there…

46
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,270
One falls! One falls! One falls!

47
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,230
Yosh! One is there.

48
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,170
I am burst, me.

49
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,159
You SICK ES! I BELIEVED AI THAT I WAS GOING TO DIE!

50
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,839
There were not the choice.

51
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,309
You have say that one would be made take if the elevator were used!

52
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,260
But it was not the sorrow to jump in the vacuum! Do not be to you the engineer with the square nose!

53
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,740
Sorry die……

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,369
Good, that goes, since one is there.

55
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,010
IF They IS GOOD, DOES NOT STRIKE ME!

56
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,430
But that is spoiled.

57
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,490
Is Ca spoiled? About what you do speak?

58
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,580
Topography and climate of this island.

59
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,099
If the wind is so strong, and if the pressure of the air falls quickly…

60
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,510
A hurricane could appear this evening.

61
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,299
It is the “City of Water”…

62
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,920
If one thinks of it, the floods are a weak point.

63
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,180
What wants to say?

64
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,610
And well, that worries me, then one will see later.

65
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,930
At all events, let us turn over to the inn.

66
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,550
Ah, welcome.

67
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,670
How you are, Blueno?!

68
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,190
Fishing?!

69
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,189
I believe that is rather well.

70
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,860
Why “I believe”? Do not be clear for you like guy.

71
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,390
As usual. The full one please.

72
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,390
You have money?

73
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,470
Dispatch, filled to me that of cola!

74
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,799
How can you make turn this bar if you requests constantly of the money to your customers?!

75
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,509
We have money.

76
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,879
There remains to us a million our purchases of yesterday.

77
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,150
WHAT?!

78
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,499
It remains so much of money since yesterday?!

79
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,959
What a shame! Ca fears!

80
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,030
I kept this money with me lasting all during the night!

81
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,720
Give me that!

82
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,239
Dear customers, it is your day of chance!

83
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,879
It is me which levels!

84
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,640
Drink as much as you will want!

85
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,169
Played well, Franky!

86
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,910
What a generosity!

87
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,100
Ouais, the hidden side of Toilets 7, thank you with you!

88
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,059
Whoa! Cool!

89
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,789
Oi, I want me too!

90
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,070
Are Oi, Blueno, where the cola?

91
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,489
Gone, hurries!

92
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,590
I see that the businesses go well for you, Franky.

93
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,090
The Kokoro old woman! You were there!?

94
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,490
I had believed to see a statue of monster.

95
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,580
Can He, I still have fruit juice, Franky?

96
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,909
One is in a bar here, not with the crib.

97
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,870
Are the businesses well, not truth?

98
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,869
Good, make as you want.

99
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,339
Youpi! Juice!

100
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,499
In fact, the businesses go well, but I am of very bad mood.

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,709
This week was the worst of my life…

102
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,289
Because of this stupid pirate!

103
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,140
And here, the full one.

104
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,769
Not too early.

105
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,880
The full one, the full one, the full one, the full one…

106
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,280
Go! Go! Go!

107
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,940
BRILLIANT!

108
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,779
I live again!

109
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,939
Dumb, until I wait you tankard!

110
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,400
By the way, the old woman, what you insane there?

111
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,139
Aqua Laguna arrives.

112
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,489
Did Ah ouais? Not astonishing whereas wind either so extremely.

113
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,240
Did you finish the preparations for your house?

114
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,060
Nan, I do not have any more a house, then I do not have anything which can run.

115
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,949
I would have liked to drink glass with Iceberg, but it appears that it was made flinguer.

116
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,879
Ouais, it appears.

117
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,449
They then say that they would be the pirates, Galley it and the craftsmen are insane of rage.

118
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,520
Did a pirate do that?

119
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,480
You believe in it, you?

120
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,639
That you know something, you would be said.

121
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,119
Spit the piece, the old woman!

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,840
Is iceberg constantly badgered by the government, not true?

123
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,210
Then you claim that it is Kogi, the representative, who made the blow?

124
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,999
This large bacon does not have the fabric of a killer.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,030
Not, the underground operations are assigned to the CP9.

126
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,220
You knew it, Blueno?

127
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,170
It is only one rumor.

128
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,369
If that pleases to you to accept the rumors on this secret organization…

129
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,000
Imbecile, they exist.

130
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,259
But they are never shown.

131
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,840
It is a secret brigade which operates in the shade.

132
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,280
Does Ca want to say what all that? You know something?

133
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,479
I heard it over there…

134
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,289
It IS THAT a WHORE OF RUMOR! STOP YOUR CONNERI…

135
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,180
Everyone is afraid because this rumor exists for a long time.

136
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,860
They eliminate people without leaving the least trace.

137
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,290
If you find yourself implied, you will leave your life there.

138
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,240
Impressing! The mission of yesterday proceeded perfectly.

139
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,040
Good work, Nico Robin.

140
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,720
No difficulty.

141
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,800
Obviously, you are now required in all the city.

142
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,360
Yes.

143
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,140
But it is only temporary.

144
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,850
Most important, it is this evening.

145
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,370
You will enter again to Iceberg.

146
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,590
In the event of pip, it is not serious but erases all the evidence.

147
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,890
Of all the apprentices of Tom who could have it in their possession…

148
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,240
Only still in life is Iceberg.

149
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,530
It does not matter how you reach that point…

150
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,830
In the name of the CP9, we will take it to him this evening.

151
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,020
Remember that this mission is for the good of justice.

152
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:34,000
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

153
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,519
Because of the imminent arrival of Aqua Laguna…

154
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,310
We inform you that all the docks of the shipyard will be used as refuges.

155
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,560
In order to limit agitations, we ask you as fast as possible to shelter.

156
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,180
However, the dock n°1 is in bad condition…

157
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,370
Yosh, I will install barricade.

158
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,140
You did not forget anything?

159
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,769
Not, they is good. Let us leave quickly to the refuge the shipyard.

160
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,379
Dad, quickly, quickly!

161
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,619
Quickly, quickly!

162
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,160
A little patience. I must do that properly.

163
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,070
If water infiltrates, all will be foutu.

164
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,109
Oi, attaches that one too.

165
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,600
Oi, the wind rises more and more!

166
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,359
You prepare, the waves start to be formed!

167
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,599
And made attention, the pirates also will come!

168
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Balls.

169
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,819
By where did it go?

170
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,770
It left by there.

171
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,479
It is inevitably in the corner!

172
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,440
Yosh, let us seek by over there.

173
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,700
Of agreement.

174
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,189
It is what this brothel?

175
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,049
Why they drive out me?

176
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,610
I include/understand anything.

177
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,700
It is for that I am required?

178
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,019
One of the assassins?

179
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,440
Then I cannot turn over any more to the inn.

180
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,840
Who is there?!

181
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,120
Here! There is a suspect guy!

182
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,650
You are sure, Mister?

183
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,099
Yes, they rented a room last night.

184
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,050
They were still there it does not have there very a long time…

185
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,469
In this inn?

186
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,730
Yes, they left full with luggage in their room, they surely will return.

187
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,810
Yosh! You, remain here.

188
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,839
The others, come with me to seek in the surroundings.

189
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,050
Excavate in the least recesses!

190
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,560
Oi, it has nobody there here.

191
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,869
You are sure that it is this boat?

192
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,500
Some! Look at, it is the standard of Straw hat.

193
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,350
They probably gave up it.

194
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,890
It is in bad condition.

195
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,979
Then, they are there?

196
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,409
Not, that flagstone.

197
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,820
It is so worn…

198
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,699
That it certainly will run.

199
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,280
Let us seek elsewhere.

200
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,750
It is which these guys?

201
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,200
What does it occur downtown?

202
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,739
They are there?

203
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,179
Not.

204
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,570
Are whore, but where?

205
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,370
He, Luffy.

206
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,219
What is there, Nami?

207
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,119
You believe that the others are well?

208
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,459
The city is attacked by the craftsmen.

209
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,880
Chopper and Sanji-kun were not discovered yet, then that must be good for them.

210
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,800
At all events, we dispatch!

211
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,700
The train of the sea is except service.

212
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,539
The train of midday already left…

213
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,070
But another share this evening, in spite of this foul weather.

214
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,459
In direction of Enies Lobby at 11 p.m.

215
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
The train of the sea is hefty man.

216
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,800
Oi, not of news of the pirates?!

217
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,199
Nothing by here!

218
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,169
If one manages to capture one of the three, the others will be easily identifiable.

219
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,710
We dispatch, before the waves do not arrive!

220
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,249
Did Robin perhaps travel by the train of the sea?

221
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,830
In this case, one will have evil to find it.

222
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,039
One already did not succeed in finding it in Water 7…

223
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,539
I perhaps opposed it with the bookstore.

224
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,089
Baka, it has no reason there that it is that.

225
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,429
He, you! Would you have seen a splendid woman like this one?

226
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,809
Ah, it? It twenty years old less, isn't this was?

227
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:08,650
If somebody finds it, the newspaper will immediately inform Galley it.

228
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,950
It is an assassin…

229
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,580
In any event…

230
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,269
It is very well to seek the criminals…

231
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,649
But you would make better find a shelter quickly.

232
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,050
You will make you carry by Aqua Laguna

233
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,440
With more.

234
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,550
The situation does not improve.

235
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,210
Luffy and the others are well?

236
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,620
Luffy is well. I worry more for Nami-san.

237
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,440
Everyone left in one anything time.

238
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,410
The wind is more and more extremely too.

239
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,280
Everyone was put at the shelter.

240
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,020
Whore. Oi, Robin-chan! Passed to you where?!

241
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,820
This odor… But it is…

242
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,680
Chopper, That is there?

243
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,380
Chopper?!

244
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,870
Oi, wait a little!

245
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,050
It is not far.

246
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,010
Oi, I said to you to wait! What it arrives to you?!

247
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,840
It is there.

248
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,920
Oi, Chopper! Chopper!

249
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,360
Oi, that goes?!

250
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,050
Is Chopper, how that?

251
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,340
You hurt yourself?

252
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,729
Do not do anything.

253
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,480
What is there?

254
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,130
You start to run of a blow and… and…

255
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,350
I was sure. It is there.

256
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,469
Robin!

257
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,750
Robin-chan!

258
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,579
Where you stays last?! You everywhere were sought!

259
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,910
Everyone worried.

260
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,409
Good, let us return to the inn now.

261
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,220
In more one had full with concern. One will explain you after…

262
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,569
But you cannot join us.

263
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,890
Wait! I come to seek you!

264
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,820
Not, they is good. Remain where you are.

265
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,300
Because I did not come to join you.

266
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,750
They is here that our ways separate, in this city.

267
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,510
What do you tell, Robin-chan?

268
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,109
I see, it is in connection with the newspaper, it is that?

269
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,050
You do not have with you to make some for that!

270
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,049
One does not believe a word of it…

271
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,570
It is traditional, the pirates are always shown with twists.

272
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,950
Yes. I am sorry to have made you accuse in this horrible crime.

273
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,250
But the charges against me are true.

274
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,489
Last night, that which infiltrated in the mayor, it was…

275
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,080
Me, without any doubt.

276
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,650
Impossible.

277
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,910
I carry in me this “darkness” that none you knows.

278
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,880
This darkness will destroy you, one day.

279
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,120
All the organizations that Nico Robin could infiltrate all were destroyed.

280
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,840
Excluded it.

281
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,800
In the beginning, I am supposed to make you accuse then to flee.

282
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,070
The things will worsen for you.

283
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,249
What?! Why you would make a thing parei…

284
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,690
You do not need to know why.

285
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,829
Robin-chan! I do not include/understand anything so that you say!

286
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,019
That there is?!

287
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,810
Robin! Let us return together!

288
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,540
One all got along well, but from today…

289
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,370
We will not be re-examined any more.

290
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,900
Thank you to have been so nice with me until now.

291
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,800
Goodbye.

292
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,550
Wait…

293
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,150
Wait!

294
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,340
I cannot…

295
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,500
To accept that.

296
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,560
He…

297
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,910
WAIT!

298
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,150
Stop your conneries!

299
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,259
Wait, Robin-chan!

300
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,640
Robin-chan!

301
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,589
Wait, Robin-chan!

302
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,910
Robin-chan!

303
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,560
ROBIN!

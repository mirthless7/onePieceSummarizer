1
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:59,268
THE MOST WICKED MAN OF EAST BLUE!
ARLONG OF THE MERMEN CREW!

2
00:01:59,268 --> 00:01:59,352
THE MOST WICKED MAN OF EAST BLUE!
ARLONG OF THE MERMEN CREW!

3
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:32,093
The weather's wonderful!

4
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:39,725
So the Grand Line's over in that direction?

5
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,187
Or is it over this way?

6
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:44,313
This way?

7
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:45,273
That way?

8
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,276
l'm so psyched!

9
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:48,443
l'm so psyched!

10
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:51,571
Shut up... can't you pipe down a bit?

11
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:51,863
Shut up... can't you pipe down a bit?

12
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:52,071
Shut up... can't you pipe down a bit?

13
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:52,363
Sorry, my bad.

14
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:52,655
Sorry, my bad.

15
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:53,322
Sorry, my bad.

16
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:57,201
We finally got a chef on our crew!

17
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:01,998
Now to find Nami, so we can finally
head for the Grand Line!

18
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:02,874
Nami-san!

19
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:03,541
Nami-san!

20
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:08,212
Just thinking about her inexplicable
beauty makes me jump for joy!

21
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,340
l sure would like to see her again soon!

22
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,553
Hey Yosaku, we're almost there, right?

23
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:16,929
The island where Nami is at?

24
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:17,263
The island where Nami is at?

25
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,432
You're too naive!

26
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:20,725
Way too naive!

27
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:21,476
Don't you get it?!

28
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:22,143
Don't you get it?!

29
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,773
We are getting closer and closer to Arlong's base!

30
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:36,157
At that time, Nami-aneki's eyes were
studying Arlong's picture carefully.

31
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,594
Things aren't as simple as they seem!

32
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:51,172
Nami-aneki wants to take that 2 million
beli that's on Arlong's head!

33
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,015
While we're taking it easy here,

34
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,635
She could, for all we know, have
already snuck into Arlong's base!

35
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,055
lt's about time for lunch, don't you think?

36
00:03:59,055 --> 00:03:59,639
Yeah.

37
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:05,895
Don't tell me you've never heard of Arlong?!

38
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:07,923
Arlong? Who's that?

39
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:08,523
Never...

40
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,072
Hold it right there!

41
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,950
Guess I'll have to explain who Arlong is to you guys!

42
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:19,283
Guess I'll have to explain who Arlong is to you guys!

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,576
Arlong is a merman, who's already
been to the Grand Line.

44
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,954
Arlong is a merman, who's already
been to the Grand Line.

45
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:23,788
Arlong is a merman, who's already
been to the Grand Line.

46
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,123
A merman?

47
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,457
A merman, eh...

48
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:27,917
Never seen one before.

49
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:28,084
Never seen one before.

50
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,003
Come to think of it, l've heard that there's
a merman island at the Grand Line.

51
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,881
And that there are lots of gorgeous mermaids there!

52
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:33,923
And that there are lots of gorgeous mermaids there!

53
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:37,260
Those mermen... do they look anything like this?

54
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,220
That's a masterpiece you got there!

55
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,012
Couldn't you guys be more serious here?!
That's a masterpiece you got there!

56
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,347
Couldn't you guys be more serious here?!

57
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:41,639
Couldn't you guys be more serious here?!

58
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,141
Fine, I'll start again from the top!

59
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:45,560
Fine, I'll start again from the top!

60
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:50,148
The reason why the Grand Line's
called the pirate's grave,

61
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:52,942
Is because there are three superpowers
that exist there.

62
00:04:53,468 --> 00:04:53,985
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

63
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:54,235
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

64
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:54,569
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

65
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,153
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

66
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:55,653
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

67
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:56,112
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

68
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:56,362
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

69
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,029
One of them, is the Shichibukai.

70
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,576
Shichibukai?

71
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:05,413
ln plain terms, they are seven pirates whom
are acknowledged by the government.

72
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,497
What the hell does that mean?

73
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,834
Why would pirates be acknowledged
by the government?

74
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,130
Because the Shichibukai would give a fixed
percentage of the treasure they
get to the government.

75
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,884
Because the Shichibukai would give a fixed
percentage of the treasure they
get to the government.

76
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,301
Because the Shichibukai would give a fixed
percentage of the treasure they
get to the government.

77
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,805
To other pirates, they're just government dogs.

78
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,390
But they're powerful!

79
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:35,860
The man who defeated Zoro, Hawk
Eyes Mihawk is one of them.

80
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,029
Wow! That's amazing!

81
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,490
There are seven of them like him?

82
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,158
The Shichibukai are really something!

83
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:42,408
The Shichibukai are really something!

84
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:48,081
Among the Shichibukai is a merman, Jinbei,
who's the captain of a mermen crew.

85
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:52,551
And the guy who fought alongside
Jinbei in the Grand Line,

86
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,922
Is a most wicked, devastating pirate... Arlong!

87
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,322
Kinda like this?

88
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,303
That's just like the other one,
only this one's standing.

89
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:03,846
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

90
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:04,597
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

91
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,014
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

92
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:05,348
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

93
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:05,890
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

94
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,766
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

95
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,017
Ever since Arlong came to the East Blue,
he's already overturned over 20 villages.

96
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:08,935
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

97
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,185
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

98
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:09,435
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

99
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:09,811
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

100
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:10,228
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

101
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:10,478
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

102
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:10,728
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

103
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:11,187
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

104
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:11,437
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

105
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:11,687
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

106
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:12,021
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

107
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,230
His power is far beyond Don Krieg!

108
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:16,943
So then, why would Nami-san run
off to someone like that, alone?

109
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,738
As l said, she's after the bounty on Arlong's head.

110
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,367
No, Nami-san might just be a mermaid herself!

111
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,495
l mean, she's totally cute!

112
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:29,163
Like this?

113
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,749
Do you have a death wish?!

114
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,958
Do you have a death wish?!

115
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,545
Don't you guys understand what
l'm trying to say here?

116
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,547
Yeah, that they're really strong mermen, right?

117
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,756
l get the picture.

118
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,175
No, you don't understand!

119
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,636
You have no idea how powerful
the mermen really are...

120
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:47,723
We'll find out once we get there. So don't worry.

121
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,393
Alright, let's get ready for lunch.

122
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:52,562
Right on, lunchtime!

123
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:54,564
Lunch?!

124
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,982
Whatche guys want?

125
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,317
l want meat on the bone!

126
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,111
l want fried beans!

127
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,863
Alrighty... leave it to me.

128
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,199
I'll make it in a jiffy.

129
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,909
So meat and fried beans...

130
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,371
Having a chef onboard is sure great!

131
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:11,748
Yeah!

132
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,875
Meat, l want a big chunk of it!

133
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:14,500
l want a big bowl of mine, too!

134
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,251
l want a big bowl of mine, too!

135
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:15,835
l want a big bowl of mine, too!

136
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:35,855
l'm finally back again...

137
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,442
My hometown...

138
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,377
Here's this month's.

139
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,420
Take it.

140
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:05,802
Arlong-kun, you think differently compared
to those normal pirates.

141
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,387
You sure know how the real world works.

142
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,725
That makes the both of us.

143
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,436
As long as you're willing to be my
comrade here in the East Blue,

144
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,605
then you'll be sure to get lots
of great things in return.

145
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:22,193
For understanding that, you're quite a perceptive
one for a captain of the marines.

146
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,778
l'm much obliged.

147
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,490
Don't be so modest.

148
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,243
You can only live a good life if you've got the dough.

149
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:31,928
Money's the best.

150
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,913
Nothing's more dependable than money.

151
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,207
Don't you think so?

152
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,834
Of course...

153
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:39,001
Even though I hate humans, a perceptive
one like you is an exception.

154
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:43,840
Even though I hate humans, a perceptive
one like you is an exception.

155
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,551
Well then, I'd like to bid leave now.

156
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:49,929
Why don't you relax a bit, have another
drink or two before you go?

157
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:55,518
A patrolling marine cruiser stopping at
a pirate island won't look too good.

158
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:59,021
I'll kill anybody who dares to report on you.

159
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:00,898
That's fine, I have to go now.

160
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,651
Hey, the Captain's leaving!

161
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:05,653
Take him to his ship.

162
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,904
Yes!

163
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:11,534
Hop in my 'octopus pot' behind me.

164
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,536
Oh, thank you.

165
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,582
But you know, every time I look at you, your
face looks more and more amusing.

166
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,417
Kinda like a mouse!

167
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,254
Hey Hachi, watch your tongue!

168
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,381
The Captain's our VIP!

169
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,842
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

170
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:29,469
No, it's alright.

171
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,725
Alright, let's go!

172
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:39,312
All these mermen look so disgusting.

173
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,773
But they've got the money though.

174
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,208
Hey you, get out of my way!

175
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,544
I'm here to kill Arlong!

176
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:06,672
My dad was murdered by him!

177
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,552
If you don't move, I'll kill you too!

178
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:21,354
Arlong doesn't have the time
to deal with punks like you!

179
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,857
If you understand, just get lost!

180
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:30,154
Take that and go take care of yourself.

181
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,241
Damnit!

182
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:42,667
Oh, you're back, Nami!

183
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:44,510
You sure have been gone for a while.

184
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:46,879
How was the trip this time?

185
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:49,132
Quite productive, I managed tons.

186
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:51,717
I can't believe there are so many idiots out there!

187
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:52,844
Take a look yourself.

188
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:57,265
You're sure the best at backstabbing others!

189
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,449
Well I must admit...

190
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:02,145
Hey crew, Nami has returned!

191
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,896
Get ready to celebrate!

192
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:05,565
It's Nami!

193
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,067
Nami's back!

194
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,533
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

195
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:22,623
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

196
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,944
W-We're finally here... Arlong Park!

197
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:55,865
This is it?

198
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:59,577
The base of the merman pirate, Arlong,
who survived the Grand Line.

199
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,081
Is Nami really in there?

200
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:08,127
Firstly, if Nami-aneki is really here, then we
should be able to find the Going Merry.

201
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,881
So shall we check if it's really
anchored at this island first?

202
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,299
Yeah, w-we should.

203
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,722
Prepare to rush in!

204
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:24,352
W-Why would we do that?

205
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,356
You moron! We don't know
anything about this place!

206
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,858
Our opponents are mermen!

207
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,652
We should plan out everything first!

208
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,529
Sorry, but I don't do those cowardly things!

209
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:38,574
Luffy has asked me to bring that woman back.

210
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,285
I don't care who the opponents
are, but I'll surely get her back!

211
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:42,954
No thanks...

212
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:43,955
Let's go!

213
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,423
There it is, found it!

214
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,049
It's the Going Merry!

215
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,384
But why would it be over there?

216
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:59,804
So Nami-aneki is definitely here...

217
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:04,142
What's the meaning of this? Untie me!

218
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:08,563
This part's to the east of Arlong
park, Kokoyashi Village.

219
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:13,151
But this is weird, why would she anchor
so far away from the park?

220
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,445
Untie me, damnit!

221
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:19,115
You got deadly wounds all over you.

222
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:21,200
So just sit there quietly and rest!

223
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:26,247
I'll handle the rest.

224
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,502
Why... I'm gonna kill you one of these days!

225
00:13:31,586 --> 00:13:34,714
I'll bring that woman back!

226
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:39,761
Just because we're not at Arlong Park,
he sure is taking everything in stride...

227
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,763
Prepare anchor!

228
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,474
Head towards the Going Merry!

229
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,019
Yosh...

230
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:51,606
Now it's time for me to name my adventure
to this uncharted island.

231
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:55,359
The title will be, ''The Great Adventures
of Captain Usopp''!

232
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,120
Is everything okay?

233
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,290
Mermen!

234
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,417
Full speed ahead!

235
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:11,709
Aye, Capt'!

236
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:12,668
Aye' Capt'!

237
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,090
Why don't we dock here?!

238
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:19,926
Didn't you see?

239
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,427
There were mermen over there!

240
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,847
They're Arlong's men!! You can't blame me!

241
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,766
You don't have the right to be mad!

242
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,229
This area must've already been controlled by Arlong.

243
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:32,355
What should we do now?

244
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:36,317
Yosh, let's just say that we couldn't get Nami back.

245
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,986
Hurry up and untie me, idiot!

246
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,156
Never seen that ship before.

247
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,074
Kinda suspicious...

248
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:46,786
Abandon ship!

249
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,245
Agreed!

250
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,914
Hold on you two!

251
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:53,751
Farewell!

252
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,380
Hey, at least untie me!

253
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,054
What? Only one guy?

254
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:08,015
Maybe he just drifted here from somewhere.

255
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,767
You can say so...

256
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,519
I'll definitely kill 'im next time!

257
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,647
I see... I guess the injury came from
the crew of this ship torturing you.

258
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,775
Anyways, let,s bring him to Arlong-san
before anything else.

259
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:19,610
Forgive me, Zoro...

260
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,405
I'll inform Luffy that you were
courageous to the bitter end.

261
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:24,407
You unfortunate soul!

262
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,576
I'll never forget you, Zoro-aniki!

263
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,911
Now, let's get to land first.

264
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:29,579
Alright.

265
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:39,964
I think this place is called Gosa village.

266
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,148
W-What happened to this place?

267
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,778
I heard that Arlong had attacked this
place a couple of weeks ago.

268
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,673
A-All the buildings are upside-down.

269
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:12,205
I heard that mermen have 10 times
the strength of a human!

270
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:17,085
Does this exemplify the power of the
men who've survived the Grand Line?

271
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,543
But how did the road turn out this way?

272
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:29,555
A monster called Mohmoo did this.

273
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,099
Monster?

274
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,977
Don't tell me they've got a monster too?

275
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:38,189
We got him from the Grand Line.

276
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:40,817
Oh, from the Grand Line...

277
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,611
''W-e''..?

278
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:46,589
You must be a friend of the guy who drifted here!

279
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,493
See ye!

280
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:50,652
See ye!

281
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:51,702
Stop right there!

282
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:52,537
No way!

283
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:53,746
Almost got nabbed there...

284
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:53,788
Almost got nabbed there...

285
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,541
Do your best.

286
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,337
Usopp-aniki, I'll stay here and wait for
Yosaku and Luffy-aniki's arrival!

287
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:06,843
Even if you're a merman, it's not like
you can catch up to me on land!

288
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:09,011
I'm used to this kind of stuff!

289
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,347
Catch me if you can!

290
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,017
What the..?

291
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,854
Got you, merman!

292
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:20,189
I'll kill you now to avenge my father's death!

293
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:27,238
Don't fight the mermen!

294
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,489
Have you forgotten?

295
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,328
This village, Gosa Village, was obliterated because
somebody went against those mermen.

296
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,124
What..?

297
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,334
He looks like a merman, but he's in fact human.

298
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,335
Just a tad different.. .

299
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,045
What do you mean ''Just a tad''?!

300
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,339
Where are you? Over here?

301
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:46,591
He's coming!

302
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,176
Merman!

303
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:49,719
This time it's the real thing.

304
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,306
Stand back!

305
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,100
I, Captain Usopp, will protect you!

306
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:58,186
If it's just this one foe, I can do something about it.

307
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,063
Take this,

308
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:04,400
SATSU NAMARIBOSHI..!

309
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:12,241
Everyone's the same...

310
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,027
I already told him not to pick a fight with
the mermen, or we'll all get killed!

311
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:21,584
What's wrong?

312
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,377
There's a man with a long nose.

313
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:24,420
Which way did he go?

314
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:25,421
That way!

315
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,339
That way, huh?

316
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,134
Hurry, bring him to my place.

317
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,731
Man, it looks delicious!

318
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:44,565
Let me see!

319
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,814
Okay, should be about ready...

320
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,363
Mohmoo! Lunchtime, Mohmoo!

321
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,575
What happened to him?

322
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,078
He should be really hungry by now.

323
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,413
Where did he go?

324
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:54,844
Nothing less from Sanji-san, this is delicious!

325
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,554
I don't care about you guys,

326
00:19:56,804 --> 00:20:00,016
I just want to be able to cook for
Nami-san as soon as possible.

327
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,771
It'd be great if we can all dine together again.

328
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:06,355
Hopefully, along with Nami-aneki.

329
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,817
We definitely will, 'coz she's our navigator.

330
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,737
She'll be going to the Grand Line with us!

331
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:14,697
That's mine!

332
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,115
But, you just had one!

333
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,117
Let me have this one.

334
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,702
But, that's still mine!

335
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:20,286
Just this one shouldn't be such a big deal!

336
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:20,578
Just this one shouldn't be such a big deal!

337
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:21,871
No, give that back!

338
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:22,246
Have some beans.

339
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:22,830
Have some beans.

340
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,206
That meat is mine!

341
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:23,748
That meat is mine!

342
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:24,165
No!

343
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:24,415
Give it back!

344
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,667
Go have some of my beans.

345
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,460
Give it to me, please.

346
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:29,879
Stop shaking the ship you bastards!

347
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:33,216
I almost wasted some fine wine there.

348
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,804
Hurry and open the gates!

349
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,473
We've found a suspicious man!

350
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:52,735
I'll ask you once more...

351
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,613
What's your purpose here?

352
00:20:56,948 --> 00:21:00,034
Like I said, I'm here to find a woman...

353
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,244
You half-fish bastard!

354
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:05,206
Oh, this low-life human got guts.

355
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:09,333
I'll let that slip this time.
But you're not allowed to say that ever again!

356
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:12,924
Us Mermen are evolved beings
who can breathe under water.

357
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:15,224
Whit these fish abilities, we are superior to humans.

358
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:19,095
With merely the power we behold is proof
that we are far better than humans.

359
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:28,855
You better get this in your head, the most superior
beings on earth are not humans, but us mermen!

360
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:34,360
If humans were to go against us, it'd
be defying the laws of nature!

361
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:38,072
I have gotten sick and tired of your theory, Arlong!

362
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,869
Why are you so serious, Nami?

363
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,037
You're special.

364
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,916
You're our greatest cartographer!

365
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,961
You never fail to draw the most
accurate maps for me.

366
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:56,799
Our brain compositions are different,
so it's obvious why I can.

367
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,176
Hey Nami!

368
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,011
What does he mean by ''our greatest cartographer''?

369
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:02,764
Why are you so close to this guy?

370
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:05,725
What? You guys know each other?

371
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,101
Don't be ridiculous!

372
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,061
He's just another victim.

373
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,607
I gained a lot of loot from them.

374
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,068
You don't even realize that you've been deceived.

375
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,195
And you still come chasing after me.

376
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,197
You're just plain stupid.

377
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:21,324
So is this your true nature?

378
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:24,285
And to think that you hated pirates...

379
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,536
Surprised?

380
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,538
Everything was an act.

381
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:29,849
You'll understand better after seeing this...

382
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,836
This is..!

383
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:44,180
I am part of this invincible crew...

384
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,767
An officer of Arlong's crew!

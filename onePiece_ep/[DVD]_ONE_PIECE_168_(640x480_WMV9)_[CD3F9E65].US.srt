1
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:12,039
After the campfire, late at night,

2
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,462
At the same time, the three Priests,

3
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:21,173
Ohm, Gedatsu, and Shura had been summoned to God's Shrine.

4
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:21,298
Ohm, Gedatsu, and Shura had been summoned to God's Shrine.

5
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,216
Ohm, Gedatsu, and Shura had been summoned to God's Shrine.

6
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:29,890
There, God Enel appeared before them.

7
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:29,931
There, God Enel appeared before them.

8
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,183
There, God Enel appeared before them.

9
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:31,224
There, God Enel appeared before them.

10
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:31,266
There, God Enel appeared before them.

11
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:31,350
There, God Enel appeared before them.

12
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,225
There, God Enel appeared before them.

13
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:32,267
There, God Enel appeared before them.

14
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:32,351
There, God Enel appeared before them.

15
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:32,476
There, God Enel appeared before them.

16
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:32,601
There, God Enel appeared before them.

17
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,185
There, God Enel appeared before them.

18
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:42,736
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

19
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:42,778
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

20
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:43,737
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

21
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:43,779
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

22
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:43,904
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

23
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:43,945
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

24
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:44,196
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

25
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:44,237
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

26
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:44,321
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

27
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:44,446
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

28
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,746
Tomorrow, I will open all the land of Upper Yard to you.

29
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:49,576
You may work your Ordeals anywhere you please.

30
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:52,329
And disregarding the rule, you may conduct yourselves in as violent a manner as you see fit.

31
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,735
Hey, Merry.

32
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:00,837
Who was he?

33
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,554
Let's get going then!

34
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:10,764
Aye!

35
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:19,189
THE PYTHON STRIKES!
THE SURVIVAL GAME BEGINS

36
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,201
Oi! Where are you going, Zoro!?

37
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,494
That's the wrong way!

38
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:33,703
West is this way!

39
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:37,207
Man, your sense of direction surprises even me!

40
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,208
West?

41
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,168
That way's east!

42
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:41,586
Oi, Luffy...

43
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:44,714
Weren't you listening!?

44
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:47,092
We're going to the skull's right eye so we have to go right!

45
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:48,093
You moron!

46
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,886
They're both screwed up.

47
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,931
We're trying to go south.

48
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,392
Would you go tell them this is the way we want to go?

49
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:57,102
Yosh, no problem.

50
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:03,024
Luffy! Zoro!

51
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,987
What? South?

52
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,072
Why didn't you say so?

53
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,458
The weather's so nice today~

54
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,835
Luffy, that's a great stick!
The weather's so nice today~

55
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,920
Luffy, that's a great stick!

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,798
You bet!

57
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:27,882
But you can't have it!

58
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:29,384
Gotta find your own!

59
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,552
Aw...

60
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,095
I want one...

61
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,222
Stick! Stick!

62
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,057
What's so great about a stick?

63
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,561
I thought that this forest...

64
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,564
...would be scarier!

65
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,816
What? It's not that bad!

66
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,029
Hey, Chopper.

67
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,364
You gonna be brave today?

68
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:52,657
Yep!

69
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:57,370
I feel much safer with these three!

70
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:01,666
Seriously, this has been a disappointment.

71
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,586
When we entered the forest yesterday,

72
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,671
There wasn't anything here.

73
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:09,132
We didn't meet a single Priest.

74
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,593
I know how you feel, Chopper.

75
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:12,677
See?

76
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,182
Such strange people.

77
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,517
Are you really that eager for an accident to happen?

78
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,402
Huh?

79
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,238
That's a strange striped tree roof...

80
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,199
It's moving...

81
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,242
What's moving, Chopper?

82
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:40,163
Huh? Oh, nothing.

83
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:43,333
If I say I saw a root move,

84
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,919
They'll think i'm scared and laugh at me!

85
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,587
I'm gonna be brave today!

86
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,172
It must be my imagination!

87
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:55,095
There's a rather strange presence here.

88
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,558
Chopper, why do you keep looking behind you?

89
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:03,812
It-lt's nothing!

90
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:07,649
What that funny-looking striped tree root?

91
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,858
Yeah!

92
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,151
It's pretty weird, isn't it?

93
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:12,862
Why's a tree root moving?

94
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,072
Yeah!

95
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,825
I actually noticed it before, and...

96
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,209
W-What!?

97
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,474
Wind, good!

98
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:43,059
Heading, good!

99
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:46,521
This is certainly pleasant. Our cruise is progressing nicely.

100
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,356
But it's a bit slow.

101
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,191
Oi, Navigator! Step it up!

102
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,569
It can't be helped, captain Usopp!

103
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,653
Would you repeat that?

104
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,530
It can't be helped!

105
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,656
No, not that part!

106
00:06:56,656 --> 00:07:00,952
The Milky Road's undulation is so intense that the Dial ship is all we can rely on.

107
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,537
Fight, Little Crow!

108
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:04,080
Oh, and Sanji.

109
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,749
You are now my official bodyguard!

110
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:09,502
The Captain is scared of this forest.

111
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:10,795
Shut up!

112
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,109
In that case, you shouldn't be up there pretending to be the captain!

113
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,968
Let me warn you, the only one I plan on protecting is Nami-san!

114
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:20,346
Oh, right. it's time to give that weird knight his medicine.

115
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:22,473
Where did Chopper say he'd leave it?

116
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:25,310
My name is Gan fall.

117
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,644
Gan Fall.

118
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:30,356
Oh, It's on top of the barrel beside the refrigerator.

119
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,066
Could you go get it, Nami-san?

120
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,192
OK.

121
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,987
Ossan. looks like you're feeling better.

122
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:38,448
Yes, I am grateful for your help.

123
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:41,784
Our doctor is the one you should be thanking.

124
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:45,914
The stuff Chopper whips up works better than anything!

125
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:50,001
Oh, but you tried to save Chopper too, right?

126
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,586
Then, I guess we're even!

127
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,382
Ossan?

128
00:07:57,508 --> 00:08:01,137
Let me tell you a little about the history of this land.

129
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,973
O-Okay.

130
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:08,853
Until six years ago, I was God.

131
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,731
Did you hit your head, Ossan?

132
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:21,532
I have heard that Upper Yard appreared in Skypiea...

133
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:26,663
...just as you know, 400 years ago, in times long past.

134
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,668
Skypiea had been a peaceful island in the sky.

135
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:37,256
Artifacts from the Blue Sea occasionally brought here by the Knock-Up Stream...

136
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:41,302
...were curious treasures to the inhabitants of the sky.

137
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:47,892
Coincidentally, all of the Vearth on Sky Island arrived here in that same manner.

138
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:55,858
But, a quantity of Vearth as large as Upper Yard apprearing in the sky semmed like an impossible miracle.

139
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:07,370
The inhabitants of the sky naturally worshipped it as a holy land and rejoiced.

140
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:14,377
But upon that Vearth were it's former inhabitants...

141
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:17,255
...and a war erupted over its possession.

142
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:22,260
Those people were the Shandians.

143
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,387
You mean the guerillas?

144
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:25,179
Yes.

145
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:29,600
So, thay used to live on Jaya when it was on the ground?

146
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,643
Precisely.

147
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:33,604
They were shot into the sky against their will.

148
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:37,400
And even so, your people drove them off of the island?

149
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,568
Yes.

150
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:43,906
The inhabitants of the sky stole the Shandians' homeland for their own selfish interests.

151
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,534
And in the 400 years that have followed,

152
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:50,454
The war between the Shandians and the inhabitants of the sky has never ceased.

153
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:54,750
The Shandians are only trying to regain their homeland.

154
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,628
That's so sad.

155
00:09:57,628 --> 00:10:00,339
SO IT WAS YOUR FAULT!

156
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,804
Yes, you are correct.

157
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,601
Oh, the medicine.

158
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,477
Excuse me. I must take it.

159
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:20,443
What about Enel?

160
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:24,780
Who is God Enel?

161
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:31,913
While I was still God,

162
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:35,708
He appeared from another sky island, leading a group of soldiers.

163
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,879
They inflicted severe damage on the Enforcers under my control and the Shandians.

164
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,423
And then they seize control of Upper Yard.

165
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:45,092
That was six years ago.

166
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:51,140
Now, nearly all the Enforcers are being forced to do some sort of labor for Enel.

167
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,767
I cannot be sure of what exactly it is.

168
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:57,146
But, for the Shandians, whomever God may be,

169
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:59,440
Their position remains the same.

170
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,693
They only want to regain their homeland.

171
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:06,981
If the Shandians only want to regain their homeland,

172
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:10,793
Why did they attack us when we arrived in the sky?

173
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,641
The Enforcers forced into labor...

174
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:37,269
...sometimes obtain a ship and attempt to escape.

175
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,772
Shandia, of course, regards them as enemies...

176
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:42,149
...and tries to eliminate them before they can escape.

177
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,527
They must have mistaken you for them.

178
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:48,614
Hey, a mistake ain't something to try to kill someone over!

179
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:53,911
Helping those refugees escape to another sky island...

180
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,580
...was another reason I became the Knight of the Sky.

181
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:01,585
There is no place on this island where criminals can escape Enel's eye.

182
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:06,173
From the sound of things, Enel's like some sort of dark lord or something.

183
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:09,885
Hey, hey, hey, you!

184
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:13,013
The almighty God... sees... all!

185
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:14,056
Since when are you one of the sky islanders?

186
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,141
ALL! ALL!
Since when are you one of the sky islanders?

187
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,058
Since when are you one of the sky islanders?

188
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:16,559
ALL!
Since when are you one of the sky islanders?

189
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,478
H-He heard what you said just now!

190
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,480
Dark...

191
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,774
No, more like a bad nature.

192
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:31,740
Enel makes those who come from outside this land out to be criminals.

193
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,040
Until they arrive for the Judgement,

194
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,538
the inhabitants of Skypiea are responsible for guiding them there.

195
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:41,302
This gave birth...

196
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,729
...to the citizens' sense of crime.

197
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:52,178
When people realize that they are committing criminal actions, they become weak.

198
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:54,472
Enel knows this well.

199
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:59,018
It is like ruling the lives of little lambs.

200
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,231
The very same way a real god would.

201
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:06,317
A very distasteful man.

202
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:12,531
When we landed at Angel Beach,

203
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:15,159
This seemed like nothing short of a paradise.

204
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,286
Who could have guessed?

205
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:21,999
The ancient City of Gold has certainly found a horrible place to hide.

206
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,626
Oh, yes.

207
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:28,088
You seemed... rather excited about that last night, but...

208
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:31,550
What is Gold?

209
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:48,150
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

210
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:50,527
Back again?

211
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:54,865
Get out of here, old man!

212
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:58,619
Enough, Wiper.

213
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:00,955
Gan Fall is here to negociate.

214
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:02,164
Negociate what?

215
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,458
Move aside, Chief.

216
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,169
You ald men are gonna find some sort of compromise,

217
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,464
And then expect us to agree to it?

218
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:12,633
Listen to me, Gan Fall!

219
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,135
We will not yield even one step!

220
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:19,475
If the war is meaningless, then give all of it back!

221
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:24,228
Do you have any idea of what you've done to Shandia!?

222
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,398
What is there to negotiate!?

223
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:30,859
I cannot return it all.

224
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:33,320
The power of the Vearth of Upper yard...

225
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,658
... is something that Skypiea cannot be without.

226
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:40,995
The people are gratful for its blessings.

227
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:47,251
I cannot take that away from those who have committed no sin.

228
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:50,713
The sky islanders have committed no crime!?

229
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:53,465
If they're sitting around, living their peaceful lives,

230
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,718
That may be true.

231
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:59,221
maybe we should start involving people besides you and your divine army!

232
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:00,806
What utter foolishness...

233
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:03,600
If you want to erase your crimes, bear the risk!

234
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,938
Take 100 innocent people who don't want to die,

235
00:15:08,564 --> 00:15:10,733
I cannot do that!

236
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:15,237
Then these negotiations are over!

237
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,908
If you don't want to lose your head!

238
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,703
Wait, Wiper!

239
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:29,293
Don't call my name without a reason!

240
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,863
I am...

241
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:41,763
...am very fond of the juice of pumpkins.

242
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,017
I'll kill you!

243
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,602
Wait, Wiper!

244
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:49,521
Warriors, restrain Wiper!

245
00:15:50,063 --> 00:15:51,148
What are you doing!?

246
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,691
Kamakiri! Braham!

247
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,401
You mustn't...

248
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:06,622
Auntie, Aisa cries often, doesn't she?

249
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:10,959
Yes, when something frightening happens in the village,

250
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,462
She always starts crying.

251
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,089
Because of Wiper.

252
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:23,680
Hush, hush.

253
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,641
Well, I don't know.

254
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,645
It is true that whenever there's trouble,

255
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,522
You're bond to find that boy there.

256
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:34,358
Why do you think he's the reason?

257
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,613
Because I'm scared of him too.

258
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:43,212
He's like a demon.

259
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:59,883
The Vearth!

260
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,677
Wiper!

261
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:04,346
I told you that was Aisa's most precious treasure!

262
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:05,472
Stop.

263
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:07,641
Braham.

264
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:11,228
There will never be another chance!

265
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,522
We will not waste this opportunity.

266
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,234
Anyone not prepared to risk his life, stay here.

267
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,777
I won't blame you.

268
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:19,987
Oi, Wiper.

269
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:21,530
Prepared?

270
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,657
We've always been...

271
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:29,621
Are you prepared to leave behind anyone who falls on the battlefield?

272
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,212
Only those who will step over their fallen comrades...

273
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:41,259
...and continue on should follow me.

274
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:45,345
Today, I will...

275
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:47,431
...take Enel's head!

276
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:55,773
Run, it's a python!

277
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:08,035
Its sheer size...

278
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:10,662
Is this another result of Sky Island's environment?

279
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:20,630
You some kind of catfish?

280
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,217
I'm gonna gut you!

281
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:33,894
How does something that big move so fast?

282
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,123
VENOM!

283
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:58,001
It's time for a tactical retreat.

284
00:18:58,502 --> 00:18:59,795
Indeed.

285
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:01,671
SCARY!

286
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:07,928
Don't let the venom touch you!

287
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:08,678
It'll be instant death!

288
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:18,188
Oi, Poison Python!

289
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,523
I'm up here!

290
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:19,564
Come and get me!

291
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:20,815
Come and get me!

292
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:22,734
Your food's getting away!

293
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,415
Robin, watch out!

294
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:31,618
FIVE FLOWERS

295
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:33,787
Nice try!

296
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,883
Robin, that was cool!

297
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,422
Yosh, I've circled around to its tail...

298
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:51,096
Shit.

299
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:58,228
Over here! Over here!

300
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:14,369
Oh my.

301
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,747
I'm back on the course, but no one's returned.

302
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:20,375
Perhaps i'm lost.

303
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,753
Should I go on ahead and wait for them?

304
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:26,089
Oh no!

305
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:27,507
Huh? Huh?

306
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:28,800
Save me!

307
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,719
Where is everyone!?

308
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:32,178
Eh?

309
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,680
Where'd they go?

310
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,849
I take my eyes off them for one instant and this happens.

311
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,100
Nevermind.

312
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,436
They can take care of themselves.

313
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:41,980
I've already memorized the map.

314
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,064
I go right.

315
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,110
Well, well...

316
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,405
Those guys... they went and got lost.

317
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:51,948
That sucks.

318
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:54,117
I'll just head to the ruins and wait for them.

319
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:55,660
I have to go directly south,

320
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,038
And that's the direction that feels the warmest!

321
00:20:58,038 --> 00:20:59,539
This way!

322
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,795
Shandia has begun their attack.

323
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,883
And the Blue Sea dwellers have separeted again.

324
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:12,969
An unexpected course of action.

325
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,998
Are they operating individually?

326
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:20,727
Today will be a splendid day.

327
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,605
How many will survive?

328
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:26,455
And thus, the survival game has officially begun.

329
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:35,533
Our goal is God's Shrine!

330
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,660
No matter what, don't get left behind!

331
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:43,291
Our objective is to take Enel's head!

332
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,626
Aye!

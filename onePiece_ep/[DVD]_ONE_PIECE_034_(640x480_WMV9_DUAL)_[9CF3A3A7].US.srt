1
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,837
You bastard... What the heck are you doing???

2
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:10,637
What do you mean?

3
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,382
We've come to get Nami back.

4
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,927
Oh yeah, where are Usopp and Johnny?

5
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,011
Usopp!

6
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,682
That's right, we can't be wasting time here!

7
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,858
What happened?

8
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,353
He's been captured by Arlong!

9
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,480
If we don't hurry he'll get killed!

10
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:28,880
He's dead!

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,780
What?!

12
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,193
Usopp-aniki is dead.

13
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,630
He's been killed...

14
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,452
By Nami-aneki!

15
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:57,886
REUNITED!
USOPP TELLS NAMI'S TRUE STORY

16
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,011
REUNITED!
USOPP TELLS NAMI'S TRUE STORY

17
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,723
Is that the truth!?

18
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,267
Yeah, it's horrible...

19
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,436
That woman's a witch!

20
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,148
In order to obtain some hidden treasure
in Cocoyashi Village for herself,

21
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,858
She was kissing up to Arlong!

22
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,778
And for that purpose, she killed
without even thinking about it.

23
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,413
She's a rotten-hearted low-life!

24
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
We've been fooled all this time!

25
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,783
Bastard!
We've been fooled all this time!

26
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:19,949
Bastard!
We've been fooled all this time!

27
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,786
Say that one more time and I'll kill you!

28
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:22,952
Say that one more time and I'll kill you!

29
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,663
Stop it Luffy, this has nothing to do with Johnny.

30
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,832
You don't have to believe me,

31
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,043
But I saw it with my own eyes!

32
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,961
I saw what she did to Usopp-aniki!

33
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,962
You're making up crap!

34
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,799
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

35
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,759
We're friends!

36
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,178
But I...

37
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,973
Who's friends, Luffy?

38
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,183
Nami!

39
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,185
Why did you come here?

40
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,028
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,522
You're my companion.

42
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,739
I came to get you!

43
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,424
How annoying.

44
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,434
Nami?

45
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,328
Friends? Don't make me laugh.

46
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,906
You're more like a pathetic group
of cooperators, don't you think?

47
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,075
Why you... I saw it with my own eyes.

48
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:02,409
Why you... I saw it with my own eyes.

49
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,536
Why you... I saw it with my own eyes.

50
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,872
How... how dare you kill Usopp-aniki!

51
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,340
And your point is?

52
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,710
You wanna try killing me to avenge him?

53
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,620
What!?

54
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,839
I'll tell you one thing.

55
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,043
Right now Arlong wants to kill
''Roronoa Zoro and his posse.''

56
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,079
All because Zoro went and did something stupid.

57
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,424
You guys may have these monster-like powers,

58
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,743
But you're no match for real monsters.

59
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,995
Hang around this island long enough,

60
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,440
and you guys will be killed for sure.

61
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:34,607
Well...

62
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,360
It doesn't concern me though.

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,507
Her cool look is still so charming!

64
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,158
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

65
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:43,408
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:43,658
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

67
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:43,992
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,242
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

69
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:44,492
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

70
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:44,784
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

71
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,035
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

72
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:45,385
Hi Nami-san!! It's me, it's me, remember me?

73
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,412
Lets go on a cruise together!

74
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,557
You stay out of this! You'll just complicate things!

75
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,833
What did you say!?

76
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,294
My love is always a hurricane!

77
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,296
Hey! Listen to me when I'm talking!

78
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,297
Where is Usopp?

79
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,257
At the bottom of the sea.

80
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,842
Why you! Quit your bullshit!

81
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,234
Why you! Quit your bullshit!

82
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,972
Do swordsmen attack women too?

83
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,282
Roronoa Zoro?

84
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,716
What did you say!?

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,144
You don't even know what's
going on so don't interfere!

86
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,697
After an emotional loss,
of course you're irritable.

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,652
You'd better watch what you say.

88
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,280
Mind your own business, bastard.

89
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,077
Aniki's! Don't be bickering at
an important time like this!

90
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,219
That's right.

91
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,905
If you're going to fight, do it off the island.

92
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,367
You outsiders quit sticking your
nose into this island's business.

93
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,359
You still don't get it?

94
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,965
The only reason I got close to you guys
is for the money, nothing else.

95
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,345
Now that you guys have nothing,
you're no use to me.

96
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,613
I'll return the ship.

97
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,775
So why don't you go find a navigator
and head to the Grand Line.

98
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,937
Go find One Piece or whatever...

99
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,065
Just get the hell out of here! You're a bother!

100
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,194
Goodbye.

101
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,563
Nami.

102
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,417
Luffy-aniki.

103
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:16,584
I'm going to sleep.

104
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,502
Sleep!?

105
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,879
Right now? In the middle of the road?

106
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,640
I don't feel like leaving the island...

107
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,469
I don't care what's happening here...

108
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,796
I'm a bit sleepy...

109
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,231
I'm sleeping.

110
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,226
Aniki...

111
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,940
Then...

112
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,241
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!
GO AHEAD AND DIE!

113
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,124
Hurry, hurry!

114
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,375
What's the big deal?

115
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,336
The marines... the marines are here!

116
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,715
The survivors of Gosa Village successfully
got in touch with the government.

117
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,052
The marines are here to rescue us!

118
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:08,753
You see!?

119
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,602
We're going to be saved! We
can finally escape this island!

120
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,809
So that's the Arlong Park I heard about from rumors.

121
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,197
You know it's the end of the world
when pirates settIe down like that.

122
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,688
Listen up men. Our duty today is to
rescue survivors from Gosa Village,

123
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,036
which has been destroyed by Arlong and his gang.

124
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:33,495
which has been destroyed by Arlong and his gang.

125
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,288
which has been destroyed by Arlong and his gang.

126
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:35,914
which has been destroyed by Arlong and his gang.

127
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,873
which has been destroyed by Arlong and his gang.

128
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,749
which has been destroyed by Arlong and his gang.

129
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,293
But I think...

130
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,298
That our duty to justice does not allow us to pretend
as if we didn't see this grounded pirate castle.

131
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,468
Does it?

132
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,961
No sir!

133
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,224
We shall eliminate Arlong and his gang.

134
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,601
Prepare to attack!

135
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,594
Yes Sir!

136
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,522
Marines from the 77th fleet?

137
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,399
Yeah, that's what it says.

138
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,808
That's a new face.

139
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,728
Someone go negotiate with the person in charge,

140
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,122
and tell them not to make any unexpected moves.

141
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,150
If they don't settle for 2 million,
go ahead and erase them.

142
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,081
They shot at us right away!

143
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,416
Arlong-san, watch out!

144
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,761
He chewed up the cannon ball.

145
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,264
That's a scary set of teeth.

146
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:39,894
Arlong-san, about the negotiations?

147
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,498
No negotiations.

148
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,608
All right let's go!

149
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,526
Attack!

150
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,778
Down with the marines!

151
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,948
Chu, hold up guys.

152
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,080
We don't need that much force
to take out some trash. Chu.

153
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,141
We'll go get them.

154
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,784
To pick a fight with us in the sea,

155
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,754
they've got to be stupid humans.

156
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,591
Three of our main fighters, this
oughta be a great fight.

157
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,345
That ship won't last three minutes.

158
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,806
How strange.

159
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,060
Sir, that bomb seems to be a dud!

160
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,854
One more time! This is to signal battle.

161
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,565
Our enemies are mermen so
don't let your guard down.

162
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,107
Yes sir!

163
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,447
Man down! He's from the merman gang.

164
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,365
Attack!

165
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,616
Hold it right there!

166
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,328
You're from the Arlong gang eh?

167
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,540
I am general Purin Purin from the marines, 77th fleet.

168
00:09:42,808 --> 00:09:47,629
We're a pretty famous marine fleet.

169
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,592
If you're not looking to die, you should quietly surr...

170
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,094
General!

171
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,428
How dare you attack our general!

172
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,262
Attack!

173
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,349
What's this shock?

174
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,226
Could there be a merman under the ship?

175
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:08,066
Sorry to bother you guys.

176
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,112
We just removed the rudder from this ship.

177
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:12,987
General!

178
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,813
What'd you say!?

179
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,489
Are you ok?

180
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,202
Don't worry about it. I missed his vitals.

181
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,665
This is a big ''if''....

182
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:30,296
But what would happen to the sea, if we moved
a boulder in the middle of a current?

183
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,231
What!?

184
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,846
Moving a boulder?

185
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,432
But that's impossible!

186
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,726
All right. Right around there Hachi.

187
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,731
General! A whirlpool appeared right in our path!

188
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,107
The rudder isn't working!

189
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,108
What!?

190
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,736
I toId you already, we removed the rudder.

191
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,256
The next stop for this crippled ship will be...

192
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,375
The bottom of the sea.

193
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,095
It can't be...

194
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,892
This is reality.

195
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,439
We can't escape from Arlong's reign.

196
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:35,170
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

197
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,218
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

198
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,542
Thanks for the work.

199
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,962
Nah, we know everything about the
winds and the currents in this area.

200
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,632
It was no sweat.

201
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,427
With our power and knowledge, we
have no adversaries in the seas.

202
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,305
And also the map Nami drew for us.

203
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,724
We moved the boulder looking at it.

204
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,018
We could even easily tell the currents.

205
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,354
It's a really well made map.

206
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,190
If we make Nami draw up maps for the whole world,

207
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,694
we could be kings of the sea forever.

208
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,784
Damn it. Nami is irreplaceable as a
member of the Arlong kingdom.

209
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,952
What a pity.

210
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,744
Pity?

211
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,663
The deal is if Nami saves 100 million beli,

212
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,000
She gets Cocoyashi Village and is free to go.

213
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,643
Is that for real?

214
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,462
Are you really going to let Nami free to go?

215
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,243
Really for real?

216
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,965
What a waste!

217
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,508
I have no choice.

218
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,628
That's my deal with her from eight years ago.

219
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,932
I keep my promises made over money
even if it means my death.

220
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,059
That's me...

221
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,312
Hey, Zoro-aniki,

222
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,898
what the hell are you thinking!?

223
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,528
You're the target of Arlong and his gang,
you know! Why don't you run away!?

224
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,713
Now that we know Nami is that kind of low-life,

225
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,658
there's no reason for you to stay on this island!

226
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,618
Reason to stay on this island?

227
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:06,636
There is a reason.

228
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,872
He's still staying here.

229
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:14,294
Are you saying that even you're thinking
of getting Nami back as a partner?

230
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,754
I don't care what happens.

231
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,132
He decides who becomes our navigator.

232
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,468
Aniki...

233
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,098
Okay,

234
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,016
I understand.

235
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,060
Although it's only been a short while,

236
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,312
Our job to bring you guys here is done.

237
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,730
I'm with him.

238
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,358
I don't want to die in vain.

239
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:37,400
Okay,

240
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:38,818
Take care.

241
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,821
Well then, until we meet again...

242
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,406
Aniki, you guys take care too.

243
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,491
You guys too.

244
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,477
Hey.

245
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,482
Why was Nami-san crying back then?

246
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,859
That woman... crying?

247
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,236
She was crying in her heart.

248
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,696
Keh.

249
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,699
What? Crying tears of guilt for killing Usopp?

250
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,828
You're serious?

251
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,291
You seriously think Nami-san killed that long-nose?

252
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,220
Back then...

253
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,558
For my business,

254
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,352
I have no other choice!

255
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,814
Back then,

256
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,034
Nami made it look like she stabbed me

257
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,119
and stabbed the back of her own hand!

258
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,866
If she didn't do that for me,

259
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,660
I would have definitely been killed by Arlong.

260
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:12,746
What should I do?

261
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:17,684
The man, Usopp, can't take being
saved all the time like this.

262
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,754
Anyway, I'd better find Zoro quick.

263
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,215
Is that Zoro right there?

264
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,750
Yes! It's him!

265
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,227
''Nami didn't kill him...''

266
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,337
Is that what you want to say?

267
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,547
Isn't that right?

268
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,474
I dunno.

269
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:37,520
I made that little servant lose it once already.

270
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,481
She may have just killed him in a fit of rage.

271
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,732
Little servant!?

272
00:15:41,394 --> 00:15:44,486
WHATS LITTLE ABOUT NAMI-SAN'S CHEST!?

273
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:44,819
Is that all you think about?!

274
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,196
Is that all you think about?!

275
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,701
He's still alive...?

276
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,162
Nope. I think he's dead now.

277
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,750
USOPP!!!

278
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,044
DID NAMI DO THIS TO YOU!?

279
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:01,753
No, uh, sorry.

280
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,129
That was him and me.

281
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,130
IT WAS YOU.

282
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,384
Luffy, you're here.

283
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,860
Yeah, a little while back.

284
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,845
I'm here too, nice to meet you!

285
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,847
I'll kill you someday!

286
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,308
Hey, you're still fine even after that?

287
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,393
Shut the hell up!

288
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,562
Oh yeah, you were killed by Nami right?

289
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,775
Damn him, Johnny was lying after all.

290
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:24,859
Actually,

291
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,278
there is some truth to it.

292
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,739
It's more the opposite.

293
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,617
Nami saved my life

294
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,561
You made quite a mess.

295
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:00,603
Nami.

296
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:01,813
What's wrong?

297
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,733
Nothing. Just came by to rest.

298
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:11,236
If you made a mess every time you came to rest, I'd go nuts.

299
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,293
And would you open that treasure map,

300
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,637
If there was nothing wrong?

301
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,415
There was just something that made me angry.

302
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,753
Them, eh? Who are they?

303
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,120
You met them?

304
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,873
Yeah, the guy said something 'bout being a captain.

305
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,067
He seemed like a liar though.

306
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,486
I heard,

307
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,590
When you were traveling with them, you
were happy and had a great time.

308
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,536
I haven't seen you happy for years now.

309
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,107
So tell me, who are those guys?

310
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,461
I promised you could talk to me
about whatever you want, right?

311
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,124
I was supposed to forget about those guys.

312
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,765
I was supposed to have erased them from my heart.

313
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,218
Yatta! I'm done!

314
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,012
Damn it. Nami won single handed again!

315
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,556
Hey Luffy. Why are you still holding so many cards?

316
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,975
I had a feeling that more is better.

317
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:24,312
Idiot! Learn the damn rules already!

318
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,414
All right then lets make the rule that more is better.

319
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,291
Okay then it's decided.

320
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:27,391
But...
Okay then it's decided.

321
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:28,191
But...
You can't decide the rules!

322
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:28,608
But...
You can't decide the rules!

323
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,335
the more I tried to erase them from my memories,

324
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,601
The more I remembered them...

325
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,005
Crap! The water's leaking in!

326
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:37,283
Quick! hold it!

327
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,583
Leave it to me!

328
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,572
Hold on!

329
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,182
For an instant...

330
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,012
I forgot the fate I brought upon myself.

331
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:07,981
What the hell do you think your crew are!?

332
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:08,106
What the hell do you think your crew are!?

333
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,119
I thought that if I could,

334
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,758
I would stay with these guys forever...

335
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:42,932
I see.

336
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,426
Of course she'd be upset.

337
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,482
Somebody actually came for her.

338
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,653
Friends huh?

339
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,666
To her,

340
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:01,993
that's the most...

341
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,380
difficult word of all.

342
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:14,589
So Nami bluffed the ''killing me
off'' part so I could escape.

343
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:19,235
I think there's a reason for her
being with the mermen pirates.

344
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,670
Of course.

345
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,805
So what do we do now?

346
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,531
Rush Arlong Park?

347
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,974
Hold on!

348
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,936
Before that we should ask Nami
for a better explanation!

349
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,370
Either way, it's useless.

350
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,850
No matter what you guys do,
Arlong's reign won't end.

351
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:34,984
Nojiko!

352
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,102
Who's that?

353
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,257
Nami's older sis.

354
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,197
Nami-san's older sister?

355
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:40,907
She's so pretty!!

356
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,801
What do you mean, ''It's useless''?

357
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,244
Do us a favor.

358
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,546
Don't meddle with this village's business anymore.

359
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,123
Leave Nami alone.

360
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,617
I'll tell you the reason why.

361
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,501
The reason?

362
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,629
You mean why she stays with the mermen?

363
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:55,422
Yes.

364
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,291
Once you hear the reason,
you must leave this place.

365
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,429
All right, then tell us the reason or whatever.

366
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,471
I'll pass.

367
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,491
I don't care about her past.

368
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,326
Where are you going?

369
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,093
A walk.

370
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,603
What do you mean, a walk?

371
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,530
You're not going to listen to the story?

372
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,481
Yeah, I'll pass.

373
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,351
What's with him?

374
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,479
Don't mind him. That's just what he's like.

375
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,940
We'll listen to the story.

376
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,243
Although it probably won't change anything.

377
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,370
I'll listen too.

378
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:31,249
I want to understand what's going on here.

379
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,169
Me too, I want to know everything about Nami-san!

380
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,547
He's sleeping.

381
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,424
Don't sleep if you said you'd listen!

382
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:43,928
I see.

383
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,698
No wonder Nami is torn.

384
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,559
A marine ship arrived?

385
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,153
It's the marine's 16th fleet.

386
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,933
Maybe they were sent by headquarters
to see about the 77th fleet.

387
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:04,324
I'm commander Nezumi of the marine's 16th fleet.

388
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:07,068
Bring forth the village leader Genzo.

389
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm Genzo, commander.

390
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,456
You, huh?

391
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,142
Escort me to Nami's house.

392
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,044
Nami?

393
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,046
What business do you have with her?

394
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,109
All you have to do is escort me.

395
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:31,267
We have to go back eight years to start the story.

396
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,146
Back when we were still young.

397
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,819
She lived in this village.

398
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:46,366
Nami and I will never forget her.

399
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,787
Her name was Bellemere.

1
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:19,110
Courrage Coby!

2
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:19,110
The newspaper of Coby and Helmeppo

3
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,150
The wind again stopped…

4
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,990
One is in a hurry to join Little Garden,

5
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,870
but one will have to make another pause.

6
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,120
While one is wedged here,

7
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,240
time passes…

8
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,910
Do not worry you.

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,460
I know that you must go to Arabasta as quickly as possible.

10
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,420
Owl! Let us fish!

11
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,670
Does He, somebody know what arrived at the soft foods?

12
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,510
Soft foods?

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,630
Oh, these things in the bucket, I ate them.

14
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,220
You puffed out them?

15
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,510
They was maggots!

16
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,010
Good Ah?

17
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,930
They were bloody good.

18
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,600
Be not supposed to you to puff out them!

19
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,690
What will one make now that you ate all the soft foods?

20
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,100
One will be able to fish more!

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,770
One has only to take that.

22
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,730
ONE CANNOT SIN WITH CA!

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,440
Oh. They is not good?

24
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,900
And with that?

25
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,070
Ouais, that can go.

26
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,740
Wait!

27
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,570
Wait, return!

28
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,870
CRETINS! SIT YOU AND CLOSE IT!!

29
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,540
You can the guy

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,870
YOU TO CALM ONE SECOND?

31
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,540
What doesn't go?

32
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,590
Ah! Nami-San is so beautiful when she is irritated!

33
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Good blood.

34
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,260
It is odd.

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,760
It is worth 30 million Berrys of reward.

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,720
I expected that it is a little more anxious.

37
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,310
Eh well, I suppose that you did not imagine that.

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,930
But if you make the account of all the villains whom it overcame:

39
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,350
the tyrant with comes up of iron of East Blue, Arlong the man-fish,

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,730
the admiral of a whole armada of pirates, Gift Krieg,

41
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,110
and although nobody is with the current, the infamous swindler,

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,660
The Captain Pirates Kuro.

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,830
And it is not all!

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,910
There was this bastard Navy which held up one crowned axe in the place of its hand.

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,250
Ah! Morgan “the logger”.

46
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,920
Morgan “the logger”?

47
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,420
I heard of him.

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,970
It was a Captain of Marine dreaded in any East Blue for its cruelty.

49
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,130
You beat somebody of as extremely as him?

50
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,430
Oh, the old man with the axe?

51
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,850
Ah yes, I wonder what becomes the guy who was with him.

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,600
I wonder whether it is always in this camp of Navy…

53
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,650
A guy?

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,570
Ouais.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,940
It is Coby, its name.

56
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,320
It is my pal.

57
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,960
Lieutenant.

58
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,840
We are ready to leave.

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,840
Very well.

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,340
How all the boats weigh the anchor!

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,680
With your orders!

62
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,730
Luffy-San, did you succeed?

63
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,430
It is me!

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,350
It is Coby!

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,110
Since this day when our ways separated,

66
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,480
I worked hard.

67
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,690
The way was strewn with obstacles, but

68
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,410
I finally achieved my dream to become Naval officer!

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,670
Morgan captain?

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,220
COBY…

71
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,760
You ES READY TO DIE, COBY?

72
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,950
Luffy-San!

73
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,810
Yo!

74
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,610
Coby.

75
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,920
They is so marvellous!

76
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,550
I… dreamed!

77
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,050
What?

78
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,830
Do not make the mariole with me, cretin!

79
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,760
Ca is enough!

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Silence!

81
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,190
The farm and sleep, stunned!

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,020
Blegarde sle kle tlu fléé ace!

83
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,150
Allette tles clonnelies!

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
However, Luffy-San…

85
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,150
I work in the Navy now.

86
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,990
Zatsuyou = Drudgeries - the low level of the hierarchy of the Navy

87
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,990
The son of the Captain Morgan, Helmeppo-San, is also assigned Zatsuyou like me.

88
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
He, stops rêvasser.

89
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,330
Ouais…

90
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,120
He Zatsuyou, is ensured to clean the panes well.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,550
Yes!

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,040
And do not forget to leave the dustbins.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,910
Hein? And the dinner then?

94
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,770
I suppose that you will not have finished before the dinner.

95
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,590
After having finished here.

96
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,050
I will burst hunger…

97
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,240
Helmeppo-San!

98
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,410
Helmeppo! Coby!

99
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,600
One allowed you to enlist in the Navy without no qualification,

100
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,230
in the special condition which you would work like Zatsuyou.

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,230
As if it were them which had enlisted us…

102
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,070
Yes, of course Sirs!

103
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,610
I will do all that I can!

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,030
Find to me anything to make!

105
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,860
Very well, as long as you included/understood.

106
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,200
You with the task hang!

107
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,080
Yes, Sirs!
You can count on me!

108
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,870
We will make even the laundry of everyone!

109
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,970
LARGE CRETIN!!

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,580
Hein?

111
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,400
Good blood, why you go voluntary for more work?

112
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,000
But it is what us, Zatsuyou, are supposed to do.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,670
And now, with the job.

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,090
Us?

115
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,760
If it is what you think, make the drudgeries all alone!

116
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,370
1,2,3,4!

117
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,820
1,2,3,4!

118
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,270
1,2,3,4!

119
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,760
1,2,3,4!

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,890
He… Ca fears.

121
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,270
This blasted Coby.

122
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,770
Why I must be Zatsuyou, good blood?

123
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,050
So only I could return at that time…

124
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,620
Helmeppo-Sama, your cocoa.

125
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,060
He! Try you to burn me?

126
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,980
Afflicted, excuse me!

127
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,470
With which believe you to speak?

128
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,850
I am the Large Captain of Navy,

129
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,750
the single son of Morgan,

130
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,870
Helmeppo-Sama, included/understood?

131
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,760
Yes, Helmeppo-Sama!

132
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,640
Ahh, the things were better front.

133
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,550
Shit.

134
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,060
But now I am wedged here.

135
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,770
And it is the fault of Straw hat!

136
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,070
It took from Papa his rank of Captain of the Navy.

137
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,030
1,2,3,4!

138
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,530
1,2,3,4!

139
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,280
It is entirely its fault.

140
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,200
All that arrived to me, it is by the fault of this foutu Straw hat!

141
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,430
Helmeppo-San?

142
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,030
What? I said to you of step to touch me!

143
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,670
I am afflicted, as you are my friend,
I wanted to ask you something.

144
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,800
Friend?

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,910
Who is friendly with you?

146
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,210
Are Eh well, we both Zatsuyou, not true?

147
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,350
I am not the type of man to remain wedged here like Zatsuyou.

148
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,010
This asshole of Straw hat.

149
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,520
You cannot put all that arrived to you on the back of Luffy-San.

150
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,400
To blame someone else for his faults will not change anything.

151
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,520
You do not believe that they are there the signs of somebody of weak?

152
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,270
What?

153
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,860
Helmeppo-San, for a very long time, you made use of the capacity of your father to live.

154
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,410
But, now you must go from before all alone!

155
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,400
Let us follow our dreams of all our forces!

156
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,790
You…

157
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,000
I have a dream.

158
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,550
One day I will become a Naval officer,

159
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,500
and I will fight the good-for-nothings!

160
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,370
How can you believe in a similar trick?

161
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,800
A p' tit snotty-nosed kid like you,
to become a Naval officer?

162
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,930
Ca will be able to never arrive!

163
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,220
Of course how that will be able!

164
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,270
After having seen how Luffy-San carried out its life, I made my choice!

165
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,810
I will become the Lord of the Pirates.

166
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,860
It is what I chose, therefore that done anything if I must die about it.

167
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,530
This is why, I want to be like Luffy-San and to risk my life for my ambition!!

168
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Then?

169
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,980
Why not do it together?

170
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,440
Do not joke with me!

171
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,160
Me, to cooperate with you?

172
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
Since when became to you if hefty man?

173
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,540
There is nothing to include/understand on the rotted lifestyle of Straw hat!

174
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,660
I will not let myself insult Luffy-San!

175
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,920
All that I said was true!

176
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,260
Ca gives me still more desire for vomitting!

177
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,390
Helmeppo-San, opens the eyes!

178
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,510
You ace not of natures to be given me!

179
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,220
Good blood!

180
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,890
Open!

181
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,310
What?

182
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:09,970
Your eyes!

183
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,100
What do they make up there?

184
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,560
Stop that!

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,380
What is there? What does it occur?

186
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,390
Helmeppo-San!

187
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,950
Mister! The two Zatsuyou boys fight on the roof!

188
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,360
What do you wait?
Dispatch you to stop them.

189
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,130
YOU TWO!!!

190
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,800
One is sorry!!

191
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,470
Hein? It is you who caused this explosion?

192
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,960
Did the Navy return you?

193
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,390
Thank you.

194
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,140
Not, one succeeded in saving our skin.

195
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,900
One will simply not be paid for the 50 years to come.

196
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,850
One would have better done to be returned.

197
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,820
Good courage to both.

198
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,320
Good! Look at that!

199
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,500
Luffy with the Straw hat causes a riot with Loguetown!
He manages to slip between the fingers of the Smoker Captain!

200
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,790
Luffy-San!

201
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,410
Ca means that Luffy-San…

202
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,960
grand Line reached!

203
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,030
It took the first step in
the achievement of its dream!

204
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,830
Everyone with the guard with you!

205
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,680
I now will summarize you the details of our mission.

206
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,160
Look at!

207
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
To look at what?

208
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,580
Dad!

209
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,810
The ex-Captain of Navy, Morgan.

210
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,100
Shown to have misused its military position and to have made suffer its fellow-citizens,

211
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,460
he will be transported to the general headquarter of the Navy to face the Court-martial.

212
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,720
Our duty is to be used as escort and to deliver it to the guard of the Vice Admiral Garp.

213
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,600
I am the Captain of Navy, Morgan “the logger”!

214
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,090
You incline in front of me!

215
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,290
I can nothing make,

216
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,660
neither for the Cour martiale nor anything else.

217
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,320
I will have just to let it leave.

218
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,750
I suppose that it has what it deserves.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,670
You know?

220
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,870
I respected my father.

221
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,480
My father was…

222
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,950
what I wanted to be.

223
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,580
But…

224
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,940
It went too far, hein?

225
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,300
Shit.

226
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,480
Why?

227
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,240
Do He, you think that my father will be carried out?

228
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,110
Eh well, I…

229
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,170
Possible that I can nothing change to what occurs.

230
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,030
Which father…

231
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,120
Helmeppo-San…

232
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,520
Everyone on the bridge!

233
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,410
Keep with you!

234
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,890
Garp…

235
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,840
It is the Vice Admiral Garp.

236
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,210
Garp the Terrible one!

237
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,370
This man is the Vice Admiral of the General headquarter of the Navy, Garp the Terrible one.

238
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,290
The man who sailed on Grand Line!

239
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,740
A hero of the seas!

240
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,050
Vice Admiral Garp!

241
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,340
Thank you to be come in person.

242
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,920
We entrust Morgan to you.

243
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,820
Not, you cannot, Helmeppo-San!

244
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,430
Vice Admiral Garp?

245
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,640
Stop!

246
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,920
VICE ADMIRAL GARP!

247
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,720
THE FARM!

248
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,350
I hear you.

249
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,890
I have not slept for 5 days.

250
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,230
We wish you good luck in your mission!

251
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,110
I reached a new record of eaten donuts.

252
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,660
Hein?

253
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,740
Not to sleep will not stop me,
I am with more than 842.

254
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,000
But I would prick a p' tit nap well now.

255
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,630
Old croûton nut.

256
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,170
MORGAN!

257
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,150
The Vice Admiral Garp represents the authority of the General headquarter of the Navy!

258
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,900
Do He old croûton, you do it dead?

259
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,580
Not a gesture!

260
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,190
If somebody moves the least muscle, I reduce this Zatsuyou in parts!

261
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,450
Dad!

262
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,660
Please, made not that!

263
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,910
Helmeppo-San is your son!

264
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,590
My son?

265
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,910
I do not need this shit!

266
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,340
I want just my freedom!

267
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,170
And to have it, I can put an end to his life in a blood bath!

268
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,760
Dad…

269
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,220
HELP me!!

270
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,930
Too much late, band of larvae!

271
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,350
Helmeppo-San!

272
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,830
Prepare you to draw.

273
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,520
Charge the gun! Aim!

274
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,910
Target:16° on the right - Distance 8263.

275
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,680
Loans?

276
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,570
Please, wait!

277
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,820
What does it make?

278
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,860
You will be made kill!

279
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,030
Go down from there!

280
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,510
Please, do not draw!

281
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,810
My friend…

282
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,770
My friend is on this boat!!

283
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,180
Release.

284
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,590
Not question!

285
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,850
Then I will kill you.

286
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,620
Stop, Zatsuyou!

287
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,780
You go too far!

288
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,880
NOT! Helmeppo-San is my…

289
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,900
my…

290
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,270
MY FRIEND!

291
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,720
Bandage imbeciles. They fight between them.

292
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,160
Your career is finished.

293
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,730
I will prefer returned being to give up my friend!

294
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,230
Please! Allow me to catch up with them!

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,390
Cretin!

296
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,160
Return!

297
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,510
You do not have any chance to catch up with them!

298
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,200
Let leave it.

299
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,110
It is a simple idiot…

300
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,220
or…

301
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,420
Your orders, Mister?

302
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,280
With all this foutu din, you awoke me.

303
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,780
Vice Admiral Garp!
It was thought that you had died!

304
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,050
Hein? Was somebody killed?

305
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,470
I had to miss that while I slept…

306
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,800
Where is the victim?

307
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,170
It was me?

308
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,260
I am free!

309
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,350
Look at!

310
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,890
The world will be prosternera again in front of me!

311
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,600
Today mark the first day of the new Kingdom of Morgan!

312
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,490
Now, mets the course in the west!

313
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,940
What do you make?
I asked you to change course.

314
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,650
Not question!

315
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,140
I cannot any more support it!

316
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,870
It protected us from his life!

317
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,200
It knew that if it were returned, its dream would fall to water!

318
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,580
And in spite of that, it protected us.

319
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,430
Even me!

320
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,870
Dad, I will stop you!

321
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,710
Come!

322
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,170
What a cretin you make!

323
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,430
With which believe you to be addressed, hein?

324
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,940
What can make an useless ver de terre like you against me?

325
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,600
I suppose that I will have to reward you for your obedience.

326
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,600
Now, it closes!

327
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,680
Your mouth!

328
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,230
Salt old!

329
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,560
Good blood!

330
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,010
Learn your place,

331
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,250
poor wretch insect.

332
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,770
I will not become your slave!

333
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,150
I am the only one to decide how I must live!

334
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,130
Be not made illusions!

335
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,380
What can make a poor wretch larva like you all alone?

336
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,160
He is not alone!

337
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,230
You!

338
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,030
Morgan!

339
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,450
Return without making stories!

340
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,200
As a soldier of the Navy, I put to you with the stops!

341
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,470
Pitiful! Pitiful! Pitiful!

342
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,680
It does not matter how much larvae as you will present yourselves!

343
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,330
If you oppose me,
I will kill you all!

344
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,480
I am afflicted, all that because you wanted to save me.

345
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,790
About what you do speak?

346
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,910
One is friendly, not truth?

347
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,820
Coby…

348
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,130
And I already made my decision…

349
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,910
I will live to carry out my dream!

350
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,920
And to carry it out, I will fight!

351
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,380
I will fight…

352
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,810
If I die by beating me, that suits me.

353
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,220
You want to die so much?

354
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,710
I do not want to die!

355
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,200
Not before becoming Naval officer!

356
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,810
But…

357
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,890
if…

358
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,350
if…

359
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,340
if I must die…

360
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,040
If that arrives…

361
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,720
If that arrives,

362
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,390
then I will die by beating me!!

363
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,420
The recreation is finished.

364
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,900
Ah! Coby!

365
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,490
Good blood! Shit!

366
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,700
Salt dumb!

367
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,320
Coby coward!

368
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,350
Coby!

369
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,020
Insects as you are not even worth the sorrow to be killed.

370
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,800
Request so that one is re-examined never again!

371
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,650
Morgan!

372
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,860
I let to you escape, this time!

373
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,780
But one day,
our ways will cross again,

374
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,690
and this day, I will capture you!

375
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,270
Prepare!

376
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,860
It arrived because of my lack of vigilance.

377
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,280
We are also guilty to have allowed the prisoner to escape.

378
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,850
We beseech your forgiveness!

379
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,670
For their actions, these deux-là will be returned definitively.

380
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,870
Which despairing duet.

381
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,440
It does not matter where I go,
I must take my responsabilities.

382
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,250
If I give up you with your fate,
you will cause only problems.

383
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,240
I do not have the choice.

384
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,070
Come with me to the General headquarter from the Navy.

385
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,690
Vice Admiral?

386
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,890
You will take them with you?

387
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,140
At the General headquarter of the Navy?

388
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,990
I cannot?

389
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,410
If… Of course that you can.

390
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,980
If you do not want to you two,
you can leave now.

391
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,020
No complaint will be retained against you for what occurred here.

392
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,240
Is necessary to as say, as it was one day rather special.

393
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,530
And thus we left for the place where Luffy-San was:

394
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,500
large sea…
Sea known under the name of Large Line.

395
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,170
I will re-examine it certainly a day!

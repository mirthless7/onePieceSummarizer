1
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,172
Aniki...

2
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:02,872
To a wound that would make an ordinary man die...

3
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,666
To a wound that would make an ordinary man die...

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,960
l won't give in!

5
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,546
Ryu!

6
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:15,802
TATSUMAKI!!
(Tornado!)

7
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,886
TATSUMAKI!!
(Tornado!)

8
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,262
TATSUMAKI!!
(Tornado!)

9
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,855
Gotta hurry... and save Luffy!

10
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:26,938
Gotta hurry... and save Luffy!

11
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:32,138
Idiot...

12
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,449
Sorry, this is all we can do for you right now...

13
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,620
l see.

14
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,332
I just gotta break the stone and hell be free!

15
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,547
This is getting interesting!

16
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,342
Whatever do you humans intend to do next?

17
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,180
PROUD, TALL WARRIORS!
DRAMATIC BATTLE OF SANJI AND USOPP

18
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,561
PROUD, TALL WARRIORS!
DRAMATIC BATTLE OF SANJI AND USOPP

19
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:06,686
PROUD, TALL WARRIORS!
DRAMATIC BATTLE OF SANJI AND USOPP

20
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,251
So it's the guy from Cocoyashi Village.

21
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,003
What useless effort...

22
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,047
Dammit! They've found us!

23
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,051
If you're trying to extend his life, what good
is it if you're going to die anyway?

24
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,595
I'll end it right now!

25
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,141
Where do you think you're going?

26
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,229
You... mere human!

27
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,233
You're really trying to challenge me underwater?

28
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,069
Holding your breath with all your might,
like an inferior creature would!

29
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,070
Holding your breath with all your might,
like an inferior creature would!

30
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,366
As you wish! Let's do it!

31
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,694
Gyojin Karate! Itomaki Kumite!

32
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,212
What now?

33
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,339
Your kick is only haIf as powerful underwater.

34
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,717
That's the limit of humans.

35
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,177
But my Merman Karate...

36
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,014
loses none of it's power down here!

37
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,308
On the contrary, it's twice as strong!

38
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,882
Gyojin Karate, Kaisoku!

39
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,344
Harakuda Shigeri!

40
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,658
Gyojin Karate...

41
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,105
Ka Ka Kakato Otoshi!

42
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,471
Kachiage Haisoku!

43
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,526
Hissatsu...

44
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,364
Joudan Bakushou!

45
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,021
Finished.

46
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,751
Air, air, air, air!

47
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,044
l've lost too much air!

48
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,630
Suffocating... can't breathe!

49
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,845
Where do you think you're going?

50
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,724
Shit, let me get by!

51
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,685
What amazing perseverance.

52
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,477
What amazing perseverance.

53
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,896
Never thought a human would have any.

54
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,918
It was you, wasn't it?

55
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,339
Who said that a man who hurts
a lady is a piece of shit?

56
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,299
But take a look!

57
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,178
Look where your mediocre chivalry has gotten you!

58
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,851
There's no escape for you, so you'll die by my hand.

59
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,146
I'll kill that sheriff, and while I'm
at it, that rubberman too.

60
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,732
Zoro, the long-nosed guy,

61
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,068
I'll massacre all of the villagers who revolted!

62
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,278
And of course...

63
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,989
That little traitor, Nami, will be no exception!

64
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,035
Understand?

65
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,747
In the end, once your smooth talk
of chivalry gets past your mouth,

66
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,498
Let alone Nami...

67
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:00,211
You can't protect anyone!

68
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,429
You may have some skill,

69
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,930
but...

70
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,642
All you really are is a puny, weak human.

71
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,940
Your body can't take rapid pressure change, can it?

72
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,107
Your body can't take rapid pressure change, can it?

73
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,571
That is to say, if I took a sudden
nosedive to the bottom...

74
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,367
The pressure change would make your
body explode from the inside!

75
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,599
Appakushi Chokakouro!

76
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,593
l won't ever forgive this bastard!

77
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,969
l can't...

78
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,972
Protect even a single person!?

79
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,614
This guy... he's not dead yet?

80
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,535
Well, as you wish!

81
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,121
We'll do it one more time!

82
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,497
These guys...

83
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,624
Use their lungs to breathe on land.

84
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,127
ln the water, they use gills.

85
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,131
That means...

86
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,800
He's just a talking fish!

87
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,345
Shall we try it a second time?

88
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,558
lf something blocks a fish's gills, he dies!!

89
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,727
Since you're a fish,

90
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,062
you'll suffer just like l am right now!

91
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,159
You...

92
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,246
Oi...

93
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:58,705
Oi...

94
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,291
Don't worry, he's okay.

95
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,459
Really?

96
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,251
Half of him.

97
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:03,418
Half of him.

98
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,711
Half?

99
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,546
Tell you later.

100
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,966
But first... Get your ass outta
the water, you fish freak!

101
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,010
I still need to kick your small-time ass!

102
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,307
You still don't understand, do you?

103
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,435
It doesn't matter whether it's underwater or on land.

104
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,978
It's still the same.

105
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,397
You've really angered me.

106
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,859
I'll show you the essence of Merman Karate.

107
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,321
The move that blew you out of the park...

108
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,331
Was a Hyaku Mai Gawara Sei Ken!

109
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,744
But my special move is the Sen Mai Gawara Sei Ken!

110
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,038
The chances of you surviving are...

111
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,958
ZERO!!

112
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:44,959
COLLIER!

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,335
COLLIER!

114
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,252
COLLIER!

115
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,466
You said my chivalry was naive?

116
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:53,635
EPAULE!

117
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,761
EPAULE!

118
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,056
That I can't protect anyone, huh?

119
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,723
COTELETTE!

120
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,599
COTELETTE!

121
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,016
SELLE!

122
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,725
SELLE!

123
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,226
POITRINE!

124
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:01,476
POITRINE!

125
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:01,726
POITRINE!

126
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,352
POITRINE!

127
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:03,103
GIGOT!

128
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,187
GIGOT!

129
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,443
Why you... Bastard!

130
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,612
You bastard!

131
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,239
Kyuu Koku Sei Ken!

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,949
Senmai Gawa...

133
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:21,746
MENTON SHOT!

134
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,497
MENTON SHOT!

135
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,415
MENTON SHOT!

136
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,687
Guess you...

137
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,189
don't need dessert.

138
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:53,228
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

139
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,318
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

140
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,923
What was that?

141
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,508
What's happening up there?

142
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,448
Kuroobi...

143
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,786
Hachi...

144
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,538
In the end, they're just ''seafood salad''.

145
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,709
A fish taking on a cook? Not in a hundred years.

146
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,586
This game...

147
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,047
Is ours.

148
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,175
You bastards...

149
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,303
You killed so many of my beloved brethren...

150
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,931
One after the other...

151
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,102
Don't you think you've gotten a little
caught up in the moment!?

152
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:14,526
Hey, when you said Luffy's HALF
okay, what did you mean?

153
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,320
Well, he's not gonna die.

154
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,117
But if you wanna free him, I gotta
go underwater again for a bit.

155
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,830
And it doesn't look like this guy
plans on letting me do that.

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,251
Amazing...

157
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,877
Really amazing!

158
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,922
They've taken out two of Arlong's best men!

159
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,429
I couldn't take it any more...

160
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,847
I can't hold my breath any longer.

161
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,140
Gen-san, let's switch.

162
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,516
I'll go this time.

163
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,144
He looks much better.. less pale.

164
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,271
Yeah, he's thrown up a lot of water.

165
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,605
What's going on over there?

166
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,816
Everything's all right. Nobody died.

167
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,693
Speaking of which...

168
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,528
Until now, I've been holding it back...

169
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,822
I feel like I don't want to believe it, but...

170
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,909
This battle's rekindling my hopes again!

171
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,966
Chu! What a handful he was...

172
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,345
So damn fast.

173
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:29,684
But it only took one blast from my
'water cannon' to finish him off.

174
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,145
Well, time to head back.

175
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,898
Things should be pretty much
done back there by now.

176
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,127
Whew, that was a close call!

177
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,504
Success!

178
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,591
Good thing I made the 'Ketchup
Star' for a time like this.

179
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,634
He thinks he killed me with his 'water cannon' thing...

180
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,053
He thinks he killed me with his 'water cannon' thing...

181
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,889
I should go back now.

182
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,478
Man, they're a horrible bunch.

183
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,857
They took out all the poor people in that village.

184
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,028
I know Nami can't change things alone...

185
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,490
And I really want to help her, but...

186
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,408
Huh?

187
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,496
Must be my imagination...

188
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,624
But I'll gladly pass on dying!

189
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,796
Stll, besides the ketchup,

190
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,717
I should try to look like I made more of an effort.

191
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:49,180
I know, maybe if I get myself dirty,

192
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,727
I could say, ''Oh! So sorry!
I got lost!'' or something...

193
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,272
Hmm, what should I say?

194
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,985
Maybe I should go like, ''Oh,
that jerk? He got away!''

195
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,530
Nah, that'll never fly, will it?

196
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,408
Aren't we nakama?

197
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,119
''Hey, don't cry, Nami.''

198
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,788
''We did our best!''

199
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:17,167
I'd rather die, than lose!

200
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,670
Or... ''Well, we each fought our hardest!''

201
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,965
It's a hundred times better than
a worthless piece of shit...

202
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,967
who'd dare hurt a lady.

203
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,971
Or... ''I was in a deadly situation!''

204
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,474
This is for my business.

205
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,351
I have no other choice!

206
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:40,690
Or... ''My wounds aren't that serious...''

207
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,984
Nami-aneki was crying!

208
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,402
She's risked her life.

209
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,654
Do we need any other reason?

210
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,823
For a 10-year old Nami....

211
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,576
Do you have any idea how difficult
that choice was to make?

212
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,955
WE SHALL FIGHT!!

213
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:07,509
Or... ''M-my b-battle... was...''

214
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,558
''That was... why...''

215
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:24,275
You ain't seen nothing yet!

216
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,445
WAIT RIGHT THERE YOU FISH FREAK!!

217
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,740
Oh?

218
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,951
You're not dead yet?

219
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:33,952
Chu!

220
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,538
Of course not!

221
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,165
I won't die from some stupid water cannon!

222
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,714
When I left Syrup Vllage, I left everything behind!

223
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,466
Tranqulity... Safety...

224
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,886
They face hardships every day,

225
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,390
and they laugh like they're really having fun!!

226
00:16:57,544 --> 00:17:00,061
That's why I decided to go out to sea!!

227
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,230
I want to laugh until I cry, too!

228
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:04,550
But if I don't fight with everything I've got,

229
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,986
There's no way I deserve to be
on the same boat as them!

230
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:12,374
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN LAUGH WITH THEM!!

231
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,294
Fool!

232
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,672
You were better off pretending you were dead.

233
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,633
You must be a little slow in the head.

234
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,509
Chu.

235
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,803
Is it...

236
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,890
...over already?

237
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,516
Yeah, it is!

238
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,517
It's over.

239
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,852
Just like you are!

240
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,479
It's over, huh?

241
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:43,789
USOPP...

242
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:44,881
HAMMER!

243
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:46,399
USOPP WAGOMU!
(Rubberband!)

244
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,818
USOPP WAGOMU!
(Rubberband!)

245
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,073
Chu?

246
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,992
Ah! Shit!

247
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,287
How did I fall for something like that!?

248
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,916
Why that li'l bastard...!

249
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:06,628
HISSATSU!...

250
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,229
- Sake? (Wine)

251
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,273
(Ultimate lead star!)
HISSATSU! NAMARI BOSHI!

252
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,760
Is this the only way you know how to fight,

253
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,428
you inferior creature?!

254
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,346
Chu!

255
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,056
No matter where you may hide,

256
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,142
I'll blow you away with my water cannon!

257
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,273
Being stupid or cowardly has nothing to do with it!

258
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:32,112
This fight... there's no way the manly
Usopp can run away from it!

259
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,656
If I lose, I die.

260
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,617
I'm a pirate now!

261
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,511
MIZU TAIHOU!!

262
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,212
No way!

263
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,756
So powerful!!

264
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,844
Why should I have to fight with this idiot?

265
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,847
He's so obvious!

266
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,349
I'll blow you to pieces!

267
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,319
Hyappatsu Mizu Deppou!

268
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:07,814
Oh no! H-how, how did he find me!?

269
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,062
Crap! Crap! Look, Usopp Pirate Crew!!

270
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:15,196
Kaya!! I went to sea to become a real pirate!

271
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:20,952
I'm going to fight so I can become
a brave warrior of the sea!

272
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,290
Those lazy days and the silly pirate games...

273
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,793
ARE ALL OVER!!!

274
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,546
What's all over?

275
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,173
This battle!

276
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,507
Wine is flammable!

277
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:37,794
HISSATSU KA EN BOSHI!!
(Ultimate Fiery Flaming Star!)

278
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,016
Hot, hot, hot-chu!!

279
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,727
Water, water, water, water, water...!

280
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:46,811
Hot, hot, hot!

281
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,312
Oh, wait!
Hot, hot, hot!

282
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:47,854
Oh, wait!

283
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,898
Water-water-water! WATER!

284
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,249
USOPP...

285
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:53,902
HAMMER!!

286
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:54,861
Chu!

287
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:54,903
USOPP HAMMER!!

288
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,300
Bastard...!

289
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:18,802
USOPP HAMMER!

290
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,135
USOPP HAMMER!

291
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:19,761
USOPP HAMMER!

292
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:20,095
USOPP HAMMER!

293
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:21,121
USOPP HAMMER!

294
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,055
USOPP HAMMER!

295
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:22,097
USOPP HAMMER!

296
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,515
USOPP WAGOMU!

297
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:23,890
USOPP HAMMER!

298
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,391
USOPP HAMMER!

299
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:24,432
USOPP HAMMER!

300
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:25,016
USOPP HAMMER!

301
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:25,350
USOPP HAMMER!

302
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:25,975
USOPP HAMMER!

303
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:26,184
USOPP HAMMER!

304
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:26,726
USOPP HAMMER!

305
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:26,810
USOPP HAMMER!

306
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:28,228
USOPP HAMMER!

307
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:28,770
USOPP HAMMER!

308
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,145
USOPP HAMMER!

309
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,005
USOPP HAMMER!

310
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,242
I won... I beat a merman!

311
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,417
You see that, loser?

312
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,420
I CAN DO IT!

313
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,505
You see that, you jerk?

314
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,092
Don't look down on me, dammit!

315
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:13,189
Please, breathe!

316
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,780
Please come back to life, or else, you'll lose...

317
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,574
Your nakama are...

318
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,617
Your nakama are...

319
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,667
I feel faint... was that a dream?

320
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,420
I'd even started to have hopes for this battle...

321
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,882
That shark guy, what's he doing?

322
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,175
No clue!

323
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,427
It looked like he was just throwing water around.

324
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,929
But then, the two of them started bleeding!

325
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,184
To kill humans like you,

326
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:54,427
I don't need to do it myself.
A little water is all it takes.

327
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,099
That's the difference between
you humans and us mermen.

328
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,342
Stop talking!

329
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,077
He's not joking...

330
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,330
to him, he's just playing around with water.

331
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,624
But it feels like a shotgun!

332
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,210
Is this, the power of a shark?

333
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:18,296
The most powerful among the mermen...

334
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,343
He's on a completely different level.

335
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,178
You should just give up.

336
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,517
Your lives aren't all that important anyway.

337
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,393
ARLONG!

338
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,770
Nami-aneki!

339
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:34,896
Nami-san!

340
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:35,897
Nami-chan!
Nami-san!

341
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,274
Yo, Nami.

342
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,737
I was just giving some loser pirates
a demonstration of our power.

343
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,198
What brings you here?

344
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,580
I'm here to kill you.

1
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:36,050
Venture with the country of sand!

2
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:36,050
The demons which live in the extreme desert

3
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,740
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,570
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,490
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,190
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,080
The old green city, Erumalu, fell in ruin.

8
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,580
To try to stop the rebellious army, Luffy and its crew…

9
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,870
got under way to cross the desert towards the oasis of Yuba.

10
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,970
I burn…

11
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,170
I do not perspire even any more…

12
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,670
Stop your moanings, Luffy.

13
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Be to you exhausting you all alone.

14
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,110
You listenings even not what I say to you.

15
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,300
I can about it more.

16
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,240
The cold is appropriate to me perfectly but I do not support heat…

17
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,860
It is because you crowned one peeling.

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,100
Why don't you withdraw this costume?

19
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,510
WHAT YOU SAY, MANURE?!

20
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,280
Do not make fun of the reindeers!

21
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,980
AAH! A MONSTER!

22
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,420
Chopper! Grown not like that!

23
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,630
I cannot any more draw you!

24
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,180
Who is a monster, moron with the long nose!?

25
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,810
Qu-Qu-Que want…

26
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,310
Why I am…

27
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,590
Take again already your usual size!

28
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,130
Heat does not seem to affect to you much, Vivi-Chan.

29
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,750
I was born and I grew in this country, I am accustomed there.

30
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,700
Are shit, why these blasted dunes also high?

31
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,170
I thought that the deserts were supposed being flatter than that…

32
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,040
It is an old desert.

33
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,860
The largest sand dunes can culminate with more than 300 meters.

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,650
3… 300 meters?!

35
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,230
One could just as easily climb mountains!

36
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,550
Aaah… I can about it more…

37
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,620
The weather is so hot…

38
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,330
Luffy! Just a mouthful!

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,800
Just of what to fill you the mouth!

40
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,220
It IS TOO MUCH!

41
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,990
Leashes for me too!
You have just taken 18 mouthfuls of them!

42
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,960
WAIT!

43
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,000
You have just had some!

44
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,030
It is my turn, now!

45
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,390
You do not beat!

46
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,630
You will waste your forces!

47
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,770
He, you did all to me to spit!

48
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,800
Are Oh, for that, you the only one to blame, not?

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
It is true! It is you who started ace!

50
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,900
I am famished!

51
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,900
Stop being if glouton!

52
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,400
It is still believed! Does not eat it!

53
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,960
Nami-San!

54
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,460
It is soon ready, thank you to have patience still a little bit!

55
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,110
Ca feels good!

56
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,050
PAS TOUCHE!

57
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,940
And why? It is ready, there!

58
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:40,820
Let eat them to us!

59
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,620
PAS TOUCHE!

60
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,040
The weather was so hot during the day.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,550
What did it arrive?

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,730
In the desert, where there is nothing to absorb heat,

63
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,220
the days are choking and the night, the temperature falls in lower part from zero.

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,240
The desert abounds in unforeseen dangers.

65
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,430
Look at all these stars…

66
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,740
You could see stars from your island, not?

67
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,690
On this kind of islands, the sky is always hidden by thick clouds of snow.

68
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,130
It is the first time that I see so many stars.

69
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,120
I have well too cold to look at stars!

70
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,730
I am well in the cold.

71
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,160
It is too well to have something of heat beside oneself!

72
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,390
He! Do not rub against me!

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,950
I make it because you are very hairy!

74
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,730
Do not make fun of the reindeers!

75
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,310
AAH! A MONSTER!

76
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,960
Chopper, does not change like that!
Be to you really shitting.

77
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,350
So hot.

78
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,750
Come nearer!

79
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,110
I bet that are you hot, hein?

80
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,720
Ouais.

81
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,150
Doesn't Ca astonish you?

82
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,500
In connection with Luffy-San.

83
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,470
I have me also astonished at the beginning.

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,890
Luffy-San does not have the behavior of a captain.

85
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,970
It is normal that a captain is respected by his crew.

86
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,790
And only this afternoon still, they fought so much just because he had drunk a little water.

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,300
However…

88
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,010
You know what?

89
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,870
After being remained with them during some time, I start to include/understand them a little.

90
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,570
It is well the manner of making of Luffy.

91
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,050
It did not change an inch since its childhood.

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,340
And although it is like that, people always gather around him.

93
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,400
It is a silly little brother but it has a strange charm.

94
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,900
Did Ah, you know it already?

95
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,050
Ca makes a long time that I know it.

96
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,420
But, thank you.

97
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,530
Ca worried you to know if I were anxious of his fate.

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,730
Yes…

99
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,120
But it seems that I worried for nothing.

100
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,390
I found a shrimp!

101
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,070
It is thus that a shrimp!

102
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,300
Too much extremely!

103
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,170
There are no shrimps in the desert.

104
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:58,770
Look at!

105
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,820
Oh, you are right! It must be a shrimp of the desert!

106
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,680
It with the air appetizing!

107
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,440
You think that is eaten?

108
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,970
Why not? I already ate lobsters.

109
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,300
It is the first time that I see a true shrimp!

110
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,960
Luffy-San, they is dangerous!

111
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,190
Throw it far!

112
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,110
Not! I will not waste it!

113
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,460
It is a scorpion!

114
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,360
It is small but its poison is mortal!

115
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,260
If it pricks you, you will die!

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,990
What? I cannot eat it?

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,120
Good, Ben, I leave it to you, then.

118
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,160
Does not give it to me!

119
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,120
Good, I throw it then.

120
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,890
I am terribly sorry. I should you have said it.

121
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,760
It is obvious!

122
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,360
What doesn't go, Chopper?

123
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,610
Something… arrives!

124
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,220
And this “something” would be… what?

125
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,390
Ah, the wind rose.

126
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,180
Everyone!

127
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,720
You put at the shelter under the rocks!

128
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,070
He? What?

129
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,140
A storm!

130
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,930
A tempête de sable arrives!

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Impressing!

132
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,970
What a force!

133
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,680
The desert has too many tempêtes de sable well.

134
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,780
I forgot to say it front but the tempêtes de sable are one of the many dangers of the desert.

135
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,730
TELL US THIS TYPE OF THINGS EARLIER!

136
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,370
Good blood, it was what that?

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,250
We all were deadened…

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,900
He, Sanji! Give us our bentos!

139
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,030
A bento of pirate!

140
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,070
Not now!

141
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,220
Not before Vivi-Chan does not say it.

142
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,140
Vivi! One can take our bentos, hein?
I am with end of forces!

143
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,100
But we made only one tenth of the way for Yuba, Luffy-San…

144
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,870
You pleasant, there?

145
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,570
You do not know the proverb which says:

146
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,260
“If you are hungry, eats.” ?

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,900
Not! Liar!

148
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,060
You have just invented it!

149
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,160
I include/understand.

150
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,760
Then, that do you say to make a pause with the next rocks which we will meet?

151
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,200
Yosh! With the next rocks!

152
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,960
He the guy! Dispatch we to reach these rocks!

153
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,410
Janken:Pierre-paper-scissors

154
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,290
That which gains in Janken will have to carry all the luggage!

155
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,580
Do not decide all alone!

156
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,240
It is not the losing one which carries the luggage normally…?

157
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,690
Well, it left!

158
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,580
JAN! KEN! PON!

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,500
He! Wait a little!

160
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,730
You played after having seen our hands!

161
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,550
I gained!

162
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,630
IDIOT.

163
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,750
Heavy…

164
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,310
It is heavy…

165
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,510
And the weather is hot…

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,090
I gained in Janken… Then why?

167
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,470
It is precisely because you gained in Janken.

168
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,760
Keep silent yourself and draws.

169
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,130
And drops nothing, hein!

170
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,390
Right in front of, rocks in sight!

171
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,420
Really?!

172
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,920
The hour of the pause! Yahoo!

173
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,930
OH! IT IS FAST!

174
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,490
Ah, of the shade!

175
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,560
It is if booooon!

176
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,410
He!

177
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,370
Cling!

178
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,750
I will seek a doctor!

179
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,480
URGENCY!

180
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,950
What? Why it returns?

181
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,070
There is a band of birds over there which are wounded too much to move!

182
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,280
Chopper!

183
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,420
Yes!

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,750
Yosh! Allons-y, Chopper!

185
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,640
We will save these birds!

186
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,900
Birds?!

187
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,070
Wait a little, Luffy-San!

188
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,770
These birds must be…!

189
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,350
All our businesses disappeared!

190
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,950
One was played!

191
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,460
I swear it!

192
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,380
There were birds with the anguish here it a minute ago!

193
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,940
I am really sorry.

194
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,860
I should have said it to you.

195
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,270
Waru:Malfaisant; Sagi:At the same time héron and swindler

196
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,270
Warusagi are birds which bernent the travellers and steal their business.

197
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,670
They are called the “swindlers of the desert”.

198
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,840
Quoooii?

199
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,100
Birds which claim to be wounded?

200
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,110
It was will hérons?!

201
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,890
Yes, of will hérons.

202
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,310
Me was rolled?!

203
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,580
Luffy! To say that you were swindled will not change anything!

204
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,890
There was for three days of provisions!

205
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,000
Stolen by a band of emplumés odd…

206
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,750
Now we are wedged in the desert in the middle of nowhere…

207
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,880
whereas we do not have any more luggage?!

208
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,350
How are us supposed to cross the desert without puffs out nor drink?!

209
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,280
It is not worthwhile to be irritated against me. I was trapped.

210
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,620
Thus be stupider to you than a pigeon?

211
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,410
What you ace known as?!

212
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,160
You will stop, the guy?

213
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,760
I am much more intelligent than a sparrow!

214
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,800
Not, absolutely not!

215
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,330
You want to fight with me?!

216
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,900
Do not annoy you to try to stop them.

217
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,850
On the contrary,

218
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,260
rather let regulate them that with their idea.

219
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,520
That which is really stupid…

220
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,290
… it is you!

221
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,850
You are right.

222
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,260
You cannot be a little more reasonable?!

223
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,270
We rest a little.

224
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,580
I was anxious for them, moron!

225
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,570
We are simply irritated because of heat.

226
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,880
But of what did you think, good blood?

227
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,550
Even without food, in one way or another, one will leave oneself there.

228
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,110
Was necessary simply to leave them!

229
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,200
Do not say that to me!

230
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,420
It is not as if we were going to die of hunger.

231
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,410
Moron!

232
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,260
It is you here the moron, imbecile!

233
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,360
Let us forget all that for the moment.

234
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,490
Keep silent yourself, stunned!

235
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,120
To only think of it my throat drains.

236
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,100
All is of your fault!

237
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,030
Ouais.

238
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,060
RETURN TO US OUR BUSINESS!

239
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,340
Luffy-San! Do not continue them!

240
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,890
Which idiot.

241
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,800
He! How you will make to find again your way?!

242
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,020
Return!

243
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,610
Luffy!

244
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,420
Stop!

245
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,450
Cease fleeing!

246
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,910
Arrêteeeez!

247
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,250
Arrêteeeez!

248
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,780
It is what that?!

249
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,950
It is what this trick?

250
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,370
A mysterious plant of the desert?

251
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,330
It is too strong!

252
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,090
What do you make?

253
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,290
Be to you funny sacrament, you!

254
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,450
You want that I help you?

255
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,710
It is an not to be eaten good thing, hein?

256
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,720
While I was occupied fighting against this trick, these person who is damned birds were made the trunk!

257
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,210
There are really many odd tricks which live in the desert, hein?

258
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,680
He, the camel.

259
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,100
What do you make here all alone?

260
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,030
Ah? Does Y have a problem?

261
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,590
You see something?

262
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,690
It is what that?

263
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,610
Luffy takes its time well…

264
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,070
I wonder whether it is not lost, after all…

265
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,590
Frankly. It left without having the least idea from where it went.

266
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,710
And there are still as well dangers in the desert as Luffy-San does not know…

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,630
It must be rather famished considering it did not eat anything since an end of time…

268
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,060
It would seem that we do not have too the choice…

269
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,210
I think that have you reason.

270
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,840
Afflicted…

271
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,250
My carefree man little brother…

272
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,670
… need has well that one deals with him.

273
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,750
One counts on you.

274
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,640
Ouais.

275
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,160
What?!

276
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,390
What? Why the ground tremble does?

277
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,860
Still a tempête de sable?

278
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,290
Not! It is not that!

279
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,050
It is…

280
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,310
Luffy!

281
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,370
…?

282
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,750
It would be?

283
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,370
What occurs? It assembles a camel?!

284
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,860
Then? It is what the trick which continues it?

285
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,190
I do not manage to see!

286
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,270
But it would be said that there is something under sand!

287
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,650
It IS ENORMOUS!

288
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,310
It is what this trick?!

289
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,990
A giant lizard of Sandora!

290
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,290
C-C-how that?!

291
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,500
They is largest of the reptiles of the desert!

292
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,770
It awaits its prey hidden under sand.

293
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,220
It has claws and teeth as sharpened as of the razors…

294
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,050
… but it has only seldom opportunity of using them.

295
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,230
Indeed, they are so large that generally they avalent their prey in entirety!

296
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,940
It as regards causing troubles, isn't this is a genius?

297
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,610
Good, let us forget the camel for the moment…

298
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,090
Under which star I was born to have so much problems?

299
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,980
He, stupid camel! Stop!

300
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,710
Luffy! Be ready for you to regulate its account to him?

301
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,840
One comes in support!

302
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,440
Ouais, I brought back a little meat to us!

303
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,610
I arrive, lizard!

304
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,030
Muchi:Whip; Tatsumaki:Tornado

305
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,790
They did not need to make some so much…

306
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,960
I am almost sorry for the monster, considering they were put there at three.

307
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,730
There is still one of them?

308
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,150
I forgot to say it, but the giant lizards of Sandora…

309
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,130
… always drive out to two!

310
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,070
Tell us this type of things earlier!

311
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,060
Ace!

312
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,870
Made attention!

313
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,630
It makes shit, him.

314
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,640
You want to play with me?

315
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,070
Yosh, yosh. Not the choice then.

316
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,580
Supervise it.

317
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,050
The rocks of the corner are like natural frying pans.

318
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,990
Good. It is what this camel?

319
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,500
'Do not know.

320
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,000
When I continued the birds, I found it being made puff out by a mysterious plant.

321
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,430
It does not have the air of a wild camel.

322
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,920
Yes, it has a saddle on the back…

323
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,620
It is you!

324
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,950
I see. I am quite content.

325
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,880
What? You know it?

326
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,680
Ouais!

327
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,790
It is the camel which carried me a little, enabling me to escape from the oasis of Katorea!

328
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,920
Well! Then one can assemble it?

329
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,830
If we can assemble it, it will be easier!

330
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,980
Yes, that well will help us.

331
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,550
I think that one can assemble it to two.

332
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,090
The camels are adapted perfectly for the desert.

333
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,070
Good, then, I am preum' S…

334
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,850
He! It is what your problem?

335
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,670
“I am a camel in love with freedom, hard to cook and chivalrous.”

336
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,680
Thank you “to have left me this delicate situation.”

337
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,400
“Ca is equal for me that one assembles me, but I do not accept the guy.”

338
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,940
Dumb…!

339
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,790
Liar! You ace carried well Chopper!

340
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,220
“By chivalrous spirit.”

341
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,620
Stop of you it Peter!

342
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,230
Moron of camel! Moron of camel!
Moron of camel!

343
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,110
I am sorry. My comrades are so malicious with you.

344
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,290
, Is not this is to you a nice camel?

345
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,140
How will I call you?

346
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,940
Moron.

347
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,590
Stopped.

348
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,300
Ball.

349
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,030
Good, then, it will be “Matsuge”.

350
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
He… It was the worst choice to be made.

351
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,670
Good now, goes up, Vivi.

352
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,710
Ca goes, I can still go.

353
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,870
Go.

354
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,570
Perverse camel.

355
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,510
Perverse camel.

356
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,610
Perverse camel.

357
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,500
Perverse camel.

358
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,100
Perverse camel

359
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,480
Perverse camel.

360
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,910
Good, one should go a little more quickly thus.

361
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,000
We must reach Yuba as fast as possible and persuade the rebels to stop.

362
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,280
Ahead, Matsuge!

363
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,040
Wait a little!

364
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,980
, Dispatch you go!

365
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,450
If you trail, you will never leave the desert!

366
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,530
Stop your doubtful jokes!

367
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,720
I like this aspect of Nami-San!

368
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,830
Let us follow them! Quickly!

369
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,730
Chopper, one goes there!

370
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,350
Ouais!

371
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,300
Wait!!

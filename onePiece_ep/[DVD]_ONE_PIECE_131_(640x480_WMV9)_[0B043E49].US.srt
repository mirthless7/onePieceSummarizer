1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:04,210
The first patient!
Anecdote of the Rumble Ball

21
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,840
I-It's too painful...

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
Stop it...

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,570
Eyelashes...

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Everyone, wake up!

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,540
Wake up!

26
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,940
Good morning, Nami-san! 

27
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,190
Allow me a passionate morning kiss... 

28
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,070
BASTARD! DON'T STICK THAT UGLY MUG OF YOURS IN MY FACE!

29
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,980
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY!

30
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,500
You bastard...!

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,340
An island!

32
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,110
We're approaching an island!

33
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,690
Huh? Island?

34
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,860
ISLAND!

35
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,880
Where's the island?

36
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,530
Look there!

37
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,400
I wonder if there'll be monsters!

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,590
I wanna see some big strong ones!

39
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,790
Please don't stomp on me...

40
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,030
Please don't stomp on me...

41
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,400
Please don't stomp out poor little life.

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,840
There's no signs of anything strange.

43
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,820
It's just a small island.

44
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,710
Look at this, Nami-san!

45
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,220
This fruit would be perfect for storing up!

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,810
And it looks like the whole island's loaded with 'em!

47
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,680
Oh, then we should gather some and stockpile them on the ship.

48
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,970
I'll bet there's a lot more plants around here I can use.

49
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,200
This island is like a cook's paradise!

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,390
Alright.

51
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,470
Then, Sanji-kun, you go look for food supplies.

52
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,330
Your four do this.

53
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,200
Huh?

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,790
Drawing straws?

56
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,870
The three who draw short straws will spend the day gathering fruit.

57
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,060
The one who draws the long straw will stay here and guard the ship.

58
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,050
And just why are you giving out the orders?

59
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,310
That's a good point.

60
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,010
Normally the captain gives the ordes, but...

61
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,160
Oh, they're all short!

62
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,340
Why the hell did you draw three!?

63
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,230
The one who takes more is smarter, right?

64
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,630
Do you honestly think there's a captain on this ship capable of giving orders?

65
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,570
No at all.

66
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,980
Am I really that smart?

67
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,220
No, you're not!

68
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,090
I drew the long straw.

69
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,510
Do I stay with the ship?

70
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,240
Yep! So Chopper, you get to stay here.

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,330
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up, let's go!

72
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,020
Let's hurry and get the fruit!

73
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,720
You're coming too, aren't you, Nami?

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
Nope!

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm going to take some time out and survey the island.

76
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,980
I want to draw a map of it!

77
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,070
I can hardly wait!

78
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,290
Later!

79
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,020
Be careful!

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,280
Come back safely!

81
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,590
Take good care of the ship!

82
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,040
The one who gathers the most fruit wins!

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,200
Eh... don't feel like it.

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,240
Why do I have to take orders from that woman!?

85
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,710
Alright, let's get going!

86
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,230
Survey! Survey!

87
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,470
Ah! Nami-san is so energetis carrying that surveying equipment on her back! 

88
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,780
Nami-san is magnificent~! 

89
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,550
Mellorine~! Mellorine~! 

90
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,800
Stop talking like a nut and get your ass over here!

91
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,920
So I'm alone today.

92
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,640
The ship looks a lot bigger when no one's here.

93
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,400
Listen up, guys!

94
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,620
From this day on, the mighty Chopper is your new captain!

95
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,850
Hey, guys!

96
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,920
Eyes up here!

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,350
Luffy! Don't eat other people's food!

98
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,040
Usopp! Get off your ass and work harder!

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,440
Sanji! Make me something good!

100
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,410
Captain Chopper, banzai! Banzai!

101
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,710
How long have you been there?

102
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,600
That was dirty, not telling me you were here...

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,980
Look...

104
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,340
I still don't trust you.

105
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,750
You were an Officer Agent of Baroque Works.

106
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,810
You're a crook, a jerk...

107
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,380
...and a BIG OCTOPUS!

108
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,050
I won't accept you.

109
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,550
Even though Luffy's accepted you as our nakama...

110
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,410
I...

111
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,210
I'M NOT SAYING A SINGLE WORD TO YOU!

112
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,810
Her specialty is assassination.

113
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,730
And her ability is really powerful.

114
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,340
I'd better be careful.

115
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,750
I fell asleep last night after I finished these ten Rumble Balls.

116
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,850
I'll use today to make ten more!

117
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,170
I should make Rumble Balls whenever I can...

118
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,260
You never know when an enemy might turn up.

119
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,110
But...

120
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,690
This reminds me of the first time I made a Rumble Ball.

121
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,940
If I use a little of it at a time, Docotorine won't notice it missing.

122
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,750
Doctorine usually mixes this and this, doesn't she?

123
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,420
Oh? And maybe this one.

124
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,360
I don't think she uses this one.

125
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,210
Chopper, have you seen my medicine bottles?

126
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,810
They're very important and difficult to replace.

127
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,970
You'd better not be playing with them!

128
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,010
Chopper!

129
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,590
Doctorine sure scolded me that day.

130
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,740
I wonder how Doctorine's doing.

131
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,590
Maybe I should write to her.

132
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,800
So you call it a Rumble Ball?

133
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,200
So you're planning on discovering the secret of my Rumble Ball and assassinating me?

134
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,240
That's not gonna happen!

135
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,110
I won't be killed by you!

136
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,490
RUMBLE!

137
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,330
GUARD POINT!

138
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,380
Hot!

139
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,410
HEAVY POINT!

140
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,470
JUMPING POINT!

141
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,010
HORN POINT!

142
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,080
Behold the power of the Rumble Ball!

143
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,050
But I'm not done yet!

144
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,720
I've known your weakness all along!

145
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,540
BRAIN POINT!

146
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,800
SCOPE!

147
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,130
Weakness! Weakness...

148
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,800
What's her weakness!?

149
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,790
What's so funny?

150
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,120
You needn't give me such a fierce look.

151
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,870
S-Stop it!

152
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,150
Stop it! Don't freakin' tickle me!

153
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,750
Stop it...!

154
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,040
You're so cute!

155
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,930
I like you.

156
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,210
C-Cute?

157
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,350
Stop joking around!

158
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,930
You liking me doesn't make me the least bit happy!

159
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,780
Why would that make me happy!?

160
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,890
Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Ass-

161
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,830
Well, shall we?

162
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,430
We've no water left now.

163
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
I'd like to have a cup of coffee before I continue reading.

164
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,870
What's the matter?

165
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,320
You have to fill that barrel since you spilled the water.

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,280
A-Ah, right.

167
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,670
Man!

168
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,610
I can't get motivated to work in such nice weather!

169
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,640
Wow, there's so many!

170
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
They got me...

171
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,150
And then, I thought to myself...

172
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,670
"This is the end."

173
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,000
"Captain Usopp-sama is finished!"

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,710
"That Giant King Condor has mortally wounded me!"

175
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,940
"I'm sorry."

176
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,060
"I wasn't able to get any fruit..."

177
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,390
"Sorry."

178
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,490
"It's fine."

179
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,770
"Don't worry about me."

180
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,190
I'm dead.

181
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,830
What do I have to take orders from that woman!?

182
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,650
Jeez, I can't stand it!

183
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,020
SANTOURYUU

184
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,020
Three sword style

185
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,220
TATSUMAKI!

186
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,220
Tornado

187
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,520
The directional traverse is about here...

188
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,710
The right ridge line is 42º.

189
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,450
My fever of love is 42º too! 

190
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,270
Please survey the heat of my love!

191
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,240
You're in the way!

192
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,100
Move it!

193
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,070
If I'm the one who's supposed to fill this with water...

194
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,230
Why's she coming with me?

195
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,280
What a pleasant atmosphere.

196
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,260
S-S-So what!?

197
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,160
Nothing at all.

198
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,380
The weather is nice. That's all I meant.

199
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,440
I just felt like going for a walk.

200
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,340
It's really been too long since I last felt like this.

201
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,890
I've felt so cooped-up every day for so long, I never really felt like laughing.

202
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,060
Water!

203
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,980
You said you'd been by yourself since you were eight, huh?

204
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,380
Yes.

205
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,690
I've survived by working with various pirates.

206
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,360
Would you tell me that about her? The person you called Doctorine.

207
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,650
You were talking about her a little while ago, weren't you?

208
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,970
She's a doctor, right?

209
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,350
Is she your teacher?

210
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,490
Y-Yeah she is.

211
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,970
Doctorine taught me everything!

212
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,530
Everyone else calls her Dr. Kureha.

213
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,120
Dr. Kureha?

214
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,290
What kind of person is she?

215
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,780
She loves to drink.

216
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,140
And although she's a woman, she looks like a pirate.

217
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,960
And although she looks like a pirate, she's a doctor!

218
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:53,120
I spent six years learning how to be a doctor from Doctorine.

219
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,700
Add these three herbs to the pestle, and then grind them together...

220
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,580
Chopper.

221
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,630
Chopper!

222
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,370
Have you finished with that meadical book yet?

223
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,920
I gave you 500 pages to read.

224
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,430
Hmph. You were up to mischief with the medicine again, weren't you?

225
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,430
IT'S NOT MISCHIEF!

226
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,550
What you're doing is the same as mischief.

227
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,130
B-But...

228
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,730
But what?

229
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,210
I-I've been studying for three years!

230
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,560
I've read 200 medical books!

231
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,810
When will you let me compound medicine?

232
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,350
You need 100 more years of training!

233
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,980
I've memorized everything in those 200 books!

234
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,220
I really have!

235
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,490
I even memorized Dr. Alexandria's Seventh Principle, and you told me it was the hardest one.

236
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,990
"Tabo-tabo bacteria start to degrade on the seventh day of the culture microbe..."

237
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,790
...as detailed in section 2, chapter 7, page 1254...

238
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,300
"...after the sign of overreaction appears..."

239
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,680
Hmph. So... what...?

240
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,930
Doctorine!

241
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,040
Are you alright!?

242
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,770
It seems I've caught something from that patient I saw the other day.

243
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,400
You have a terrible fever!

244
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,590
Chopper, you've been making all these grand statements about your medical skills,

245
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,240
so show something for it.

246
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,270
I'll be your first parient.

247
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,460
I won't give you even one piece of advice.

248
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,860
If you fail, I will die.

249
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,680
Learn through experience.

250
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,640
Learn that medical science is a deadly fight with a patient's life.

251
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,660
Can a blue-nosed reindeer win that fight?

252
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,080
I'm sure now!

253
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,350
This is Mondrin bacillus!

254
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,940
The medicine which kills this bacillus...

255
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,600
This is it.

256
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,500
Doctorine...

257
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,160
Don't die...

258
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,970
Please!

259
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,230
Let me see.

260
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,450
Aren't you going to ask what's in it?

261
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,680
There is no patient who has room in their heart to ask such a queation.

262
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,250
Illnesses can't be cured unless a patient completely trusts their doctor.

263
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,560
How is it?

264
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,890
Do you fell better?

265
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,710
Idiot.

266
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,320
No medicine starts working that fast.

267
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,530
Let me sleep for a little while.

268
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,970
Chopper!

269
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,020
It was very good work, for someone like you.

270
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,660
That was the very first time Doctorine ever complimented me.

271
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,160
It was the only compliment I received in those entire six years.

272
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,650
Instead of accepting me as a doctor, she trusted me with her life.

273
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,670
That's Doctorine!

274
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,570
She's that kind of person.

275
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,260
I'll never forget.

276
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,270
And someday... I'll become a great doctor and make her proud!

277
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,730
Oh no! I said too much...

278
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,060
Eh?

279
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,180
We should head back. It'll be dark soon.

280
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,400
I wish I had someone to write to.

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,870
Like you have.

282
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,060
Eh?

283
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,200
Heavy...

284
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,500
Heavy...

285
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,870
And?

286
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,150
Why weren't you two able to get anything?

287
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,810
I'm not really sure actually.

288
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,100
Back then, I thought to myself...

289
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,060
Just as the Giant King Condor attacked me...

290
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,540
"Sorry, guys."

291
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,810
"I risked my life to get the fruit..."

292
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,760
"...but I didn't make it!"

293
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
Oh, I'm dead.

294
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,340
On the other hand, Zoro did a really good job!

295
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,380
Yep.

296
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,510
You're going to have to continue on through the night now!

297
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,900
Ah, Nami-san is so wonderful when she gives snappy orders! 

298
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,930
Shut the hell up! You lech of a cook!

299
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,800
You lookin' for a fight, Marimo-head!?

300
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
I was kidding!

301
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,370
Anyway, we haven't had a day as peaceful as this for a long time!

302
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,610
What about you?

303
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,090
What did you do on the ship all day?

304
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,920
Me?

305
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,900
Nothing in particular...

306
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,620
But it's been a great day!

307
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:12,200
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

308
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,120
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

309
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,380
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

310
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,800
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

311
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,060
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

312
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,270
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

313
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,250
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

314
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,250
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

315
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,990
Let's paint a story of the future

316
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,240
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

317
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,290
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

318
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,290
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

319
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,250
A never ending journey to be together.

320
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,250
A never ending journey to be together.

321
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,460
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

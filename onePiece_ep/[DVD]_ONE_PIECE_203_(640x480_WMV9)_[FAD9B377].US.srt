1
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,180
Nami?

2
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,810
One was made have….

3
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,810
Our spoils DISAPPEARED!

4
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:33,740
2nd attack on the fortress

5
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:33,740
The pirate boat disappeared!

6
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,660
What?

7
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,660
They will escape!

8
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,580
Catch up with them!

9
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,670
But Major….

10
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,740
This zone conceals
rocks emerged from everywhere.

11
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,190
It is very riqué to continue the continuation
as long as the fog did not rise.

12
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,130
Yes I know it!

13
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,380
Ahead!

14
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,270
But…

15
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,080
You know what it will occur
if one lets them slip by?!

16
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,180
One will be overpowered sarcastic remarks and will be underestimated
by the other bases of the Navy!

17
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,110
It would be a terrible affront!

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,940
You want to say…. that
fortress of Navarone could…

19
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,290
Exactly!

20
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,130
Our reputation will be tarnished.

21
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,660
They will treat us dead losses which
are not rotten to even capture a fly.

22
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,910
They will start again the polemic to know
so yes or not, they will have to crush us.

23
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,650
Then!

24
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,470
You could support that as
sailor of the Fortress of Navarone?!

25
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,880
To in no case!

26
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,670
With all the ships!
Changement de vitess!

27
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,100
And plunge in the thick fog!

28
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,990
It is the ocean!

29
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,110
One will be able to leave if one
continue straight!

30
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,320
One does not leave!

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,740
Change course!

32
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,870
Made half-turn!

33
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,850
Immediately!

34
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,770
It is necessary to turn over to the fortress!

35
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,580
Soldiers of the Navy us
concealed all our gold!

36
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,750
What you say?!

37
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,510
Is Ouais, but reasonable?

38
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,970
Nami… one came very close to death for
to succeed in arriving up to now.

39
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,950
Yes it is reasonable, it is all
what there is of more reasonable!

40
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,450
That would not have any direction of
to leave from here without our gold!

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,420
When the money is in
play, that does not laugh any more.

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,430
Nami-san is so beautiful when
it is in this state!

43
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,960
But looks at!

44
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,270
A so large breach was made!

45
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,500
That would be damage of
not to thread there, nan?

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,390
We are pirates,
not true, Luffy?

47
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:35,900
Ouais.

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,210
You do not think that they is ashamed for
pirates to leave a treasure behind them?

49
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,910
Ah, I see.

50
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,590
Well, it is decided then!

51
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,430
Made half-turn!

52
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,700
Change the direction of the rudder!

53
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
Cape towards the fortress!

54
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,220
Yes, well included/understood.

55
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,580
Ouais! All that Nami-san orders!

56
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,170
Bar with starboard!

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,960
Go!

58
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,390
He, the guy!

59
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,420
You shake what?!

60
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,050
Made not anything!

61
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,050
It is well, it is well.

62
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,490
Continue like that!

63
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,730
Make sound the bells!

64
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,530
Make still sound them!

65
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,680
The fog reduces the visibility.

66
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,700
Let us avoid the collision!

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,430
It occurs what?

68
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,790
Keep silent yourself Luffy!

69
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,620
Hein?

70
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,590
A wind small bell?

71
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,920
It is a bell of alarm which allows
to announce its position to his/her comrades.

72
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,320
That fears!

73
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,050
The waves come from face.

74
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,320
Here! Nami-san, that
presents itself well, hein?

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,340
At all! With port side immediately!

76
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,020
Hein?

77
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,690
Trajectory is changed!

78
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,980
If one continues it is
the assured collision!

79
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,360
It is for the interest
of Nami-san… Go!

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,860
One will be made strike!

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,050
I failed to be reduced in crumbs without
to have been able to see the glare of our gold!

82
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,970
I wonder what it occurs in top.

83
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,710
Still?

84
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,900
This time, small bells
wind mills are more numerous!

85
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,970
They come very from opposite.

86
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,860
A ship, two…

87
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,850
Not, there are several
ships in approach!

88
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,740
It is what this brothel!

89
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,010
Nami-san!

90
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,510
One transfers with port side or starboard?

91
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,630
With port side all!!

92
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,730
It is necessary at all costs
to leave this fog!

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
What it occurs, good blood?!

94
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,980
One types oneself some, trust
Nami-san and all will occur well!

95
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,580
It is the best navigatrice in the world.

96
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,100
It is time, one will strike!

97
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,730
Lord the Almighty…

98
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,050
One has escaped it beautiful.

99
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,480
Let us continue straight!

100
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,610
One should not waste time.

101
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,880
That becomes urgent to leave
of this awkward fog.

102
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,800
One will be made locate!

103
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,100
Ouais, exact!

104
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,000
If one leaves this smoke, one
will become the game of a shooting!

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,060
Our bodies put in parts…

106
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,480
will sink in the sea!

107
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,390
Then one will throw oneself to water!

108
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,420
Miss Navigatrice.

109
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,250
I consulted file.

110
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,880
Formerly this fortress
was populated even.

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,780
And it appears that several ships
of war were used there.

112
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,400
He, Robin! You do not believe that the moment is badly
chosen to tell us an old history?!

113
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,600
They are ships of reserve.

114
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,530
They are certainly in
ruins per hour that it is.

115
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,820
This is why there is much of
unused docks in bay.

116
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,650
Unused docks….

117
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,120
I see!!

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,800
Robin, it is a good pipe, that!

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
The guy!

120
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,100
One will hide Merry in
this unused dock!

121
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,060
Hein? But it is where?!

122
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,740
You have only with
to follow my instructions.

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,000
Qu-Quoi…?!

124
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,460
Call the guards!

125
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,500
Question to see them whether the ship of
Straw hat crossed the gate!

126
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,280
O-Oui!

127
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,750
Call to the guards.

128
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,510
Here the vessel of Drake.

129
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,790
The ship of the band of
Did straw hat pass?

130
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,510
How?!

131
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,000
Apparently no ship
the gate did not cross.

132
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,300
How?!

133
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,560
Where you disappeared,
dirtinesses of pirates…

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,470
It could be that…

135
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,390
you slipped by beyond the horizon…

136
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,600
while the artillerists were
plunged in the fog?

137
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,910
Humm…

138
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,290
All my excuses!

139
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,560
We lost sight of the fact the pirates
whereas we had reached the ocean.

140
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,850
They volitilized
how by magic!

141
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,650
Ah, in the final analysis…

142
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,560
Well, you made good job.

143
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,830
For the moment, return at the base.

144
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,680
We will establish
a new strategy.

145
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,290
There is no reason
that they leave from here.

146
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,020
As long as their dream resides
in this fortress.

147
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,870
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

148
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,530

GOMU-GOMU-NO-FANSUB

149
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,860
Let leave to me!

150
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,080
Or I will carry felt sorry for near the court
martial for offense towards a superior!

151
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,900
You hear that?

152
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,260
The cour martiale!

153
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,920
Will have you that to do it
when you can it.

154
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,880
You! Slacken this person!

155
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,310
All our excuses, Lieutenant!

156
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,430
I warned you!

157
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,370
I am the special inspector
envoy by the HQ of the Navy.

158
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,270
The Lieutenant of frigate, Shepard!

159
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,150
Hum… The band of Straw hat
some share by there must be.

160
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,380
I want well to take them
in hunting still a little.

161
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,090
I will wait until they
leave their burrow.

162
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,280
These pirates of Straw hat
we gave wire to retordre.

163
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,710
Research will show after it
delicious meal which will give again us forces.

164
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,360
It is what that?

165
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,540
It is different from it
that one ate this morning.

166
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,430
Ouais, I never ate a meal
like that of this morning until now…

167
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,110
He, cooks!!

168
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,510
Spin us of good
puff out like this morning!

169
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,800
Slip by of good food us!

170
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,470
Slip by of good food us!

171
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,290
Jessica-san!

172
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,590
Slip by of good food us!

173
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,770
All the soldiers complain about the meal.

174
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,970
Slip by of good food us!

175
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,320
Slip by of good food us!

176
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,250
Slip by of good food us!

177
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,150
Finally… Leave us
to use this receipt!

178
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,150
Slip by of good food us!

179
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,790
My friends,

180
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,220
where thus the honor passed
cooks of Navarone?

181
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,790
Jessica-san!

182
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,570
This cook was perhaps a pirate.

183
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,310
Only, it concocté dishes for
soldiers returning of their mission the empty belly.

184
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,160
It is a cook of exception!

185
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,750
It is true.

186
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,480
Its kitchen had the virtue
to give energy!

187
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,880
An incommensurable number soldiers
are them also fallen under the charm.

188
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,290
Please,
reconsider your words.

189
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,380
Please.

190
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,050
Please, Jessica-san.

191
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,940
PLEASE!

192
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,740
I do not want to lose vis-a-vis him.

193
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,880
We will prepare ourselves the goods
dishes which give people full with energy.

194
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,260
But today, let us put
our self-esteem on side…

195
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,120
and let us borrow its receipt
that it left us.

196
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,290
It is true that when it
found in this kitchen,

197
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,580
he was not a pirate
but a cook out-par!

198
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,940
And the priority of a cook is
to be able to satisfy its customers!

199
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,350
Jessica-san!

200
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,470
You dispatch!

201
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,820
Made not await the customers!

202
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,930
Ouais!

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,220
Then Nami… One will do what there?

204
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,130
It is not yet too late…

205
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,870
One can move towards the gate
to leave to reach the ocean.

206
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,840
Ouais, soldiers from here
do not make the things with half.

207
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,240
Even if one wants gold, one
risk our skin, what!

208
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,590
Do Luffy, you think what of it?

209
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,810
I want gold but I have the flagstone!

210
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,700
Sanji, prepares puffs out it!

211
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,180
I will throw an eye on
ingredients and to see what I can do.

212
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,380
But our reserves are empty!

213
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,340
While excavating as it is necessary,
something well will be found.

214
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,240
You want to really flee
by giving up gold here?

215
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
Ouais, ouais.

216
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,610
Ah ah, what a damage!

217
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,890
The division of this treasure would be
equitable, it is obvious!

218
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,880
Normal, considering the enormous quantity of gold!

219
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,980
Our life would be so much more
comfortable with each one our share…

220
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,700
Ouah! The same share each one!

221
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,610
Naturally.

222
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,070
I awaited it!! I go
to buy a bronze statue to me!

223
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,660
Really? I could
to buy books to me?

224
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,190
Last medical books!

225
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,660
I would like to study the last techniques
medical appeared that I am still unaware of!

226
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,740
A new pan, a news frying pan,
ustensils and an effective rat-trap…

227
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,130
It me will remain about it more than one should not any.

228
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,130
I could drink as much as I want.

229
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,940
Then?

230
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,170
Oui-Oui!

231
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,130
Initially, 80% represent
my hidden economies.

232
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,930
Wait a little!

233
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,430
I joke!

234
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Obviously how it is a joke!

235
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,880
Who would have economies
also colossal?!

236
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,860
Major the part of this gold
will use to repair the boat.

237
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,260
The boat? You want to speak about Merry?

238
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,780
Exact! It is our Going all the same
Merry which took us along up to now.

239
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,890
Now that I think there…

240
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:36,830
it is true that one embarked from my village
native in East Blue and badly not sailed with…

241
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,580
It dates a little but.

242
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,150
I undertook personally
design of this ship…

243
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,400
and of the assembly with
to start from my plan…

244
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
until the placement of the veils.

245
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,220
I present Going Merry to you!

246
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,640
Hurry to go up.

247
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,670
One is friendly, not truth?

248
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,040
Ca-captain…

249
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,190
It is me, the Captain!

250
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,530
Do not say anything!
It is me, the Captain!

251
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,820
This ship transported things so much,
it east impresses memories….

252
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,830
I decided to leave our island.

253
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,460
Good… I from go away.

254
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,410
I go there.

255
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,810
One crossed the Mountain Reverse
and travelled on Large Line…

256
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,640
thanks to him.

257
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,250
Incredible…

258
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,230
The backward flow of water
point towards the top.

259
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,840
It left!

260
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,060
One entered the clouds!

261
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,970
I see it!

262
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,440
It is thus that, more
large sea in the world.

263
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,190
Large Line!

264
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,970
One Piece is
some share with far!

265
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,920
GO!!!

266
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,950
Then, one went
in the Celestial islands…

267
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,030
Who is the navigatrice of this boat?

268
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,930
It is you, Nami-san!

271

Ouais!

272
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,480
ONE FLIES!!

273
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,480
Brilliant! This boat flies!

274
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,480

Me… I already protected it
ship with the danger of my life!

278
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,200
Not! Stop!

279
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,060
Please, stops!

280
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,290
All but not the boat!

281
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,270
Shit!

282
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,060
Then there was this unknown
who repaired us the ship….

283
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,610
I It AI SEEN FOR TRUTH!!

284
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,950
It is insane with all that it
boxed, it held good!

285
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,180
It held out until now,

286
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,390
but it in ruins, isn't this falls?

287
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,740
I am of agreement.

288
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,380
It is the great patching up
of Going Merry!

289
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,660
I am therefore!

290
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,100
Well, I do not know yet with
how much will rise the total expenditure…

291
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,960
One will have to reserve the division
equitable until the resumption of the treasure.

292
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,420
Us were plundered
majority of our food,

293
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,980
but what was with
the interior of the refrigerator was intact.

294
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,160
Eh well, go ahead.

295
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,330
Indeed, do-it-yourself of amateur of Usopp
will not allow us to go well far.

296
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,740
I said it to you! I am gunner
and not naval engineer!

297
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,680
But the old Mechanic-san
had also advised me…

298
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,190
that it would have to be done
to repair for good.

299
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,020
The ideal would be to take it along
on a shipyard…

300
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,550
so that a true engineer
naval can occupy itself some.

301
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,340
There thus exist people more
qualified that you in repair, Usopp.

302
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,620
From time to time it is better that a pro
takes care some, if not one could regret it!

303
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,440
Ouaip! It is decided!

304
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,650
One will seek a naval engineer
to become our companion.

305
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,750
One will live still full with adventures.

306
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,360
Ouais.

307
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,950
Its aptitude will be essential.

308
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,640
Ouais, ouais.

309
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,110
Merry, it is our house with all.

310
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,520
It is our life!

311
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,040
One will go in the search of an engineer
who will take care of the ship!

312
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,380
It starts again…

313
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,820
It is so rare when it
express yourself on essential things.

314
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,040
It is important! It is what one will do!

315
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,170
Then, it is decided!

316
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,730
Ouais, that would be well
to find somebody.

317
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,110
And also a musician!

318
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,490
Not, drops.

319
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,200
It is quite beautiful
to give objectives,

320
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,980
but you had not forgotten
the condition sine-qua not?

321
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,150
Which?

322
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,240
One must recover our gold!

323
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,220
Indeed.

324
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,180
Still should it be known where
our gold is stored…

325
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,480
Probably in a trunk.

326
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,590
It well is known, that.

327
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,720
It is precisely because one does not know
the place of the trunk which one breaks the head!

328
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,210
Do not excite you.

329
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,440
Here perhaps?

330
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,650
It is only one presumption…

331
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,020
But if gold is dissimulated
in the fortress,

332
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,410
it is surely in
the part best kept.

333
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,040
That does not astonish me by you, Robin-chan!

334
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,210
It is true! This place
with the air to lend itself to it!

335
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,560
Ok, everyone! One goes
over there and our gold is recovered!

336
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,870
But one will leave Going Merry here?

337
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,880
It would be likely to be discovered.

338
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,570
If you want to hide a tree,
hide it in the forest!

339
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,390
If you want to hide a ship,
hide it among all the ships!

340
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,340
Of agreement, it is right that….

341
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,380
It is not a ship only one
can dissimulate so easily…

342
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,160
Formerly, this dock was an old building site
naval where and repaired the boats were manufactured.

343
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,600
When we moved here, I have
between outline several intact materials.

344
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,050
I see! I have just had an idea!

345
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,580
Here what one will do….

346
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,560
I would need your assistance to all!

347
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,760
Ouais!!

348
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,240
Then?

349
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,410
With that, there will not be any more blood
of ink to be been done for Merry!

350
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,650
To disguise our Going Merry in the ship
Navy, what a brilliant idea!

351
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,510
I wonder whether one will pass sufficiently
unperceived under this getup merdic.

352
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,450
While looking under several different angles,
I see only a navire de guerre Navy!

353
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:34,980
Yes.

354
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,500
It is serious…?

355
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,340
Well! It is time
to recover our gold!

356
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,180
The guy, our mission
will begin at midnight crushes!

357
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,060
Of agreement?

358
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,180
Ouais!!

359
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,070
But why one
does not start now?

360
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,640
Ben, it is obvious, one
more fishing will have the night.

361
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,220
Ah ok!! It is for
environment, I see!

362
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,180
I see.

363
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,980
Euh… That does not have anything to see!

364
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,470
Going merry is now in safety but
, you wait there will not go there like that!

365
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,300
Good blood, to move in group,
it is too much risky!

366
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,640
Listen well, I go you
to reveal my special plan.

367
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,970
Soon in One Part:

368
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,230
Not there, it is me!

369
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,490
Soon in One Part:

370
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,990
Plans of the resumption of gold
and of the recovery of Waver!

371
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,200
I will become valorous
warrior of the seas!

372
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,450
You too?

373
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,000
and of the recovery of Waver!

374
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,000
Plans of the resumption of gold

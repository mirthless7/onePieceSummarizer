1
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,960
Everyone brace yourselves on the ship or get into the cabin!

2
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,660
THE SEA'S GONNA EXPLODE!!

3
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,840
Unfurl the sails, right now!

4
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,180
If we've got wind and an ocean, it can be navigated!

5
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,430
Who's this ship's navigator?

6
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,750
IT'S NAMI-SAN~!?

7
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,100
WOW!

8
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,050
THE SHIP'S FLYING!

9
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,090
I wonder what we'll find above that cloud!

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,110
WE'RE ENTERING THE CUMULOREGALIS CLOUD!

11
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,110
This is the sea of the sky! The knight of the sky and Heaven's Gate

12
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,330
Hot damn! They got away!

13
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,770
They're pretty lucky.

14
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,520
How can you be taking this so lightly!?

15
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,820
Our prize just got away!

16
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,630
Do something, Captain!

17
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,630
Let's go after them and finish what we started!

18
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,850
Don't lose your head, Burgess.

19
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,180
It's not like they've disappeared from the world itself.

20
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,980
We'll see them again soon enough.

21
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,260
As long as they remain on the Grand Line.

22
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,380
Precisely.

23
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,940
Everything in this world moves according to the will of the strong.

24
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,620
Like a fine piece of clockwork.

25
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,210
See!

26
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,680
Jeez…

27
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,630
Damn…

28
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,920
What the hell happened?

29
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,940
Everyone still here?

30
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,580
Oi, everyone take a look!

31
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,590
Look around the ship!

32
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,860
What is this place?

33
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,770
It's SOOO white!

34
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:18,700
Clouds!

35
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,790
We're on top of the clouds?

36
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,180
How are we floating on them?

37
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,640
Sure we can float on them.

38
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,370
They're clouds.

39
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,800
No, we can't!

40
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,010
Oh no! Usopp's not breathing!

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,600
WHAT!?

42
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,560
Do something!

43
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,740
Try CPR!

44
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,540
Yosh! I'll give Nami-san CPR-!

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,920
Yutz.

46
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,320
Usopp! Hang on!

47
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,280
Usopp!

48
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,880
The clouds…

49
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,190
What!?

50
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,580
CLOUDS!

51
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,970
Too many clouds!

52
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,050
What's going on!?

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,580
This is like the sea of the sky.

54
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,770
Sea of the sky?

55
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,460
But, look. The log Pose is still pointing up.

56
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,490
We seem to be in the middle layer of the Cumuloregalis cloud.

57
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,930
So we have to go higher? How?

58
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,570
That I don't know.

59
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,590
Who're you calling a yutz?

60
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,610
I forget.

61
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,220
A sea…

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,940
For his first course, Captain Usopp is going for a swim!

63
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,620
Let's see it!

64
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,290
Oi, oi, oi! Don't do anything stupid!

65
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,130
We still don't know the nature of this sea.

66
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,620
A sea is a sea~!

67
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,830
Awesome!

68
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,370
He's so brave!

69
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,660
There's so little resistance…

70
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,820
And the visibility's so low that I can barely see anything.

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,400
I can dive deeper, so easily.

72
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,920
Deeper…

73
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,270
Usopp's lucky…

74
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,910
I wish I could swim too…

75
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,670
It's probably really fun…

76
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:58,810
Oi.

77
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,250
He's … not coming up.

78
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,690
Just a thought…

79
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,860
Is there a bottom to this sea?

80
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,160
YOU THINK…!?

81
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:11,860
That idiot!

82
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,240
Did he fall out of the cloud!?

83
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,150
USOPP!

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,700
What's that idiot doing!?

85
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,700
Stretch your arm as far as you can!

86
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,780
But I can't see the bottom-

87
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,110
Don't worry.

88
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:22,920
I'll handle it.

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,970
Ojos Fleur!  --  Eyes Flower (Spanish)

90
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,520
I see him!

91
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,790
Where!?

92
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,750
Veinte Fleur!  --  20 Flowers

93
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,840
Ok, pull him up!

94
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,370
You got him?

95
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,300
Yosh!

96
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,400
Is he heavy?

97
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,750
I don't think so…

98
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,050
C'mon Luffy!

99
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,750
Don't give up!

100
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,930
Yes! There he is-!

101
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,700
Something else came up!

102
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,740
They want to eat Usopp!

103
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,050
You don't have to be that scared of this!

104
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,090
Man… this place… sure takes the breath out of you…

105
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,970
Now, this is a weird-lookin' animal.

106
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,290
I can't even tell if it's a fish.

107
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,230
That octopus was almost like a balloon.

108
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,700
But they were still animals.

109
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,480
They were moving.

110
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,420
Animals in the sky?

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,010
So we really should think of this more as an ocean than a cloud.

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,520
What is this flat snake?

113
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,340
It's a flatfish. 'Cause it's flat.

114
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,100
So this is a flatfish?

115
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,010
For the love of…

116
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,200
What is it now, Usopp?

117
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,680
My overalls…

118
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,890
There's something in them!

119
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,700
Usopp!

120
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:40,930
Sky Island scary...Sky Island scary...Sky Island scary...Sky Island scary...Sky Island scary…

121
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,920
He's had a rough day.

122
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,540
Would you say this is a Skyfish?

123
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,480
The strange fish Norland mentioned in his logbook.

124
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,850
Since this sky sea has no bottom.

125
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,850
They must have evolved various adaptations to survive.

126
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,290
Like becoming balloons or flattening out their bodies?

127
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,090
To reduce their density.

128
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,950
This sea's buoyancy is significantly lower than that of the sea below us.

129
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,860
Its scales look like feathers.

130
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,600
And it's unusual for it be a carnivore.

131
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,650
I sautéd it.

132
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,900
This is great!

133
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,640
WE'RE NOT DONE LOOKING AT IT YET!

134
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,560
What do you guys think you're doing!?

135
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,420
Oh, you're right.

136
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,210
It's delicious!

137
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,190
What is it?

138
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,310
I've never tasted a texture like this.

139
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,590
I'm glad you like it, Nami-san! ?

140
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's eat that big one too!

141
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,550
That one's too scrawny to be worth the trouble.

142
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,990
Where's Sky Island?

143
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,250
Oh, a ship.

144
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,520
A ship-

145
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,140
Oi, guys! A ship!

146
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,410
And a person?

147
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,310
Oi, what's wrong, Chopper?

148
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,230
Chopper, you see a ship?

149
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,320
Is there a ship over there?

150
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,860
NO! I mean, there was-

151
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,170
But the ship's gone now!

152
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:47,940
What?

153
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,870
There's a bull charging right at us on a square cloud!

154
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,150
I don't understand!

155
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,870
Calm down!

156
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,280
The hell…?

157
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,770
A person!

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,590
Someone's coming!

159
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,650
He's riding on top of the clouds!

160
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,190
Oi, hold it!

161
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,190
What do you want?

162
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,100
I shall reject you!

163
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,670
He wants a fight!

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,960
Fine by me!

165
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,910
What? What?

166
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,070
H-Hey! What's wrong with you three!?

167
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,050
HE'S GONNA SHOOT US!

168
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,580
Sky Island scary...Sky Island scary!

169
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,200
That's enough!

170
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,020
What!?

171
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,290
Who is it now!?

172
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,130
I am the Knight of the Sky.

173
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
He's retreated.

174
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,450
What's going on here?

175
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,070
Just who was that?

176
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,600
And what's more…

177
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,160
What's wrong with you guys?

178
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,870
That was pathetic!

179
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,960
All three of you together couldn't handle him!

180
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,240
Thank you for helping us!

181
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,110
No need for thanks. This is a service.

182
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,390
Dammit… I'm disappointed.

183
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,620
Somehow, my body…

184
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,770
… won't move that well.

185
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,170
It must be because the air's so thin.

186
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,660
Yeah, now that I think about it…

187
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,870
Are you Blue Sea dwellers?

188
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,260
Blue Sea dwellers?  What do you mean?

189
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
Oh yeah, who are you?

190
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
I am the Knight of the Sky.

191
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,650
"Blue Sea dwellers, is the general term for those who live beneath the clouds."

192
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,750
Knight of the Sky?

193
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,820
So, I presume that you traveled up from the Blue Sea.

194
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,090
Yeah, that's right.

195
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,610
Then this is no surprise.

196
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,070
This is the White Sea, 7,000 meters above your Blue Sea.

197
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,690
Furthermore, above this sea is the White-white Sea, 10,000 meters above your own.

198
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,580
Ordinary Blue Sea dwellers' bodies cannot handle it.

199
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,840
Yosh, I think I'm getting used to it!

200
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,390
Yeah, I feel a lot better than before.

201
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,750
No, no, no, no, no, that's not possible.

202
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,710
I have to know! How was that guy running on top of the clouds?

203
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,030
Yield, yield, yield. I am certain you have many questions for me,

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,820
But first we must talk of business.

205
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,600
Business?

206
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,160
I am a free mercenary.

207
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,160
And this is a sea of many dangers.

208
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:47,440
Since you know not the battle of the sky, you will be easy targets for the guerillas or the Skyfish.

209
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,700
One whistle and I will rescue you for a price of 5,000,000 extols.

210
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,270
What're you talking about, Ossan?

211
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,230
You fool! It is a small price to pay!

212
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,760
I will not take one extol less!

213
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,830
I have to make a living, you know!

214
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,270
But what's this extol thing you keep talking about?

215
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,160
And what do you mean by whistle?

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,970
You mean you did not come by way of the High West?

217
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,600
But you must have at least stopped by one or two islands!

218
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,740
C'mon, what're you talking about, Ossan?

219
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,470
Hold on! You mean there are other ways to get to this sky sea?

220
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,600
And one or two islands?

221
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,600
You mean there's more than one Sky Island?

222
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,070
You mean that you-

223
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,100
We rode the Knock-Up Stream here.

224
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,100
Riding that monstrous current?

225
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,320
To think there are still souls brave enough to dare to do that…

226
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,290
I knew it wasn't a normal route!

227
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,190
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA DIE!

228
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,400
IF WE'D GATHERED MORE INFORMATION WE WOULD'VE HAD AN EASIER TRIP!!

229
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,020
We're here now! It's all good!

230
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,870
It's all your fault!

231
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,040
We're here now! It's all good!

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Sky Island scary… Sky Island scary…

233
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,040
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

234
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,480
Have you lost any of your crew?

235
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,750
Nope, we all made it!

236
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,430
The other routes would not have been so merciful.

237
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,300
If you had brought 100 people, it would be a gamble as to how many would survive.

238
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,110
But by using the Knock-Up Stream, either you all die or you all survive.

239
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,830
There are few left willing to risk losing everything.

240
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,270
Especially in recent years.

241
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,090
I have great respect for your brave and trustworthy navigators.

242
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,330
Well, it was the course I picked, after all!

243
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,050
"I'm the navigator!"

244
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,710
Hey.

245
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,960
One whistle means blowing sharply into this.

246
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,480
I will descend from Heaven itself to lend you aid.

247
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,850
I normally ask E5,000,000 for future visits,

248
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,740
But I shall give you on whistle as a present.

249
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,740
Wait! We don't even know your name!

250
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,370
I am the Knight of the Sky, Gan Fall!

251
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,500
And this is my partner, Pierre!

252
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,510
I should have mentioned that my partner, Pierre…

253
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,390
… is a bird who has eaten and gained the ability of the Uma Uma Fruit. (Uma - Horse)

254
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:07,940
The bird?

255
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,440
Meaning, he can become a winged horse!

256
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,940
Namely…

257
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,510
Oh my!

258
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,110
How wonderful! A Pegasus?

259
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,830
Yes, a Pegasus!

260
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,120
That's… questionable.

261
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,710
Brave souls, may luck be with you!

262
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,420
Well that was certainly strange…

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
And by the way… was there any point to it transforming?

264
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,510
Dunno…

265
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,790
In the end… he didn't really tell us much.

266
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,900
Yeah!

267
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,240
Not a damn thing!

268
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,240
We can blow this and he'll come back.

269
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,910
How are we gonna get higher?

270
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,520
Yosh! I'll call that Ossan and ask him!

271
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,540
W-W-W-W-W-Whoa, hold it luffy!

272
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,730
That's only to ask for help in an emergency!

273
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,680
What if that weirdo in the mask shows up again!?

274
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,500
Anyway, let's move the ship somewhere.

275
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,690
Hey, look over there!

276
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,350
I wonder what that is.

277
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,620
Weird clouds, huh?

278
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
It looks like a waterfall.

279
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,670
Yosh, that's that then.

280
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,170
We'll go over there.

281
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,270
Hold on!

282
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,350
Stop, stop!

283
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
Some large clouds are blocking our path.

284
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,120
What do we do?

285
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,860
They're floating above the sky sea, so they can't be part of it.

286
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,370
What kind of clouds are they then?

287
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,070
If they're ordinary clouds, we can just sail through them.

288
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,600
I'll touch one and find out!

289
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,020
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

290
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,340
Ah, it bounced off!

291
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,310
Look! I'm bouncing!

292
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,420
I'm not sinking!

293
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,370
It's so soft!

294
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,620
Just like cotton!

295
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,540
What is it?

296
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,430
What is it?

297
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,860
It's almost too fun!

298
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,490
Wooow~!

299
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,510
What a strange phenomenon.

300
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,570
Quite mysterious.

301
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,620
I'm going too!

302
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,210
Me too!

303
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,030
Ahh~! This feels nice!

304
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,630
It's so warm, I think I might fall asleep.

305
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,630
It's more comfortable than a thousand futons.

306
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:33,010
But, that means we can't take the ship through any place where these clouds are.

307
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,560
Hey, look for a route the ship can use while you're up there!

308
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,950
Okay, yosh!

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,910
Oi, Luffy!

310
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,420
There's something else over here!

311
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,200
What? Really?

312
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,640
Hey! Where're you going!?

313
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,820
Quit playing around!

314
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,470
What's that?

315
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,340
A gate?

316
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, there's a huge gate underneath that fall-looking thing.

317
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,280
So there's something man-made here?

318
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,610
Nothing is out of the question on this sea.

319
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,290
Well, we'll know once we get through here!

320
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,560
Go left next!

321
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,510
No, right!

322
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,000
IT WAS LEFT!

323
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,330
No, right!

324
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,800
I'll call the Armor Ossan!

325
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,690
DON'T!

326
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,510
Stop!

327
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,300
Moron!

328
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,390
Yosh, we made it through!

329
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,550
It really is a gate…

330
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,300
And look! Those clouds that looked like a waterfall really are a fall!

331
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,830
It's flowing over that new type of cloud we just saw.

332
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,480
Let's see, let's see… "Heaven's Gate"

333
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,460
A gate to Heaven?

334
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,340
Oi! Is this a joke!?

335
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,400
It's like we're going to die!

336
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,290
Or, what if we're all dead already?

337
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh. That would certainly account for all the weird stuff here.

338
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,850
Huh!? We're dead!?

339
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,030
Heaven, eh? Sounds like fun!

340
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,020
Funally goin' there!

341
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,180
We're not going to die!

342
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,570
What was that for!?

343
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,570
Because you made that bad joke!

344
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,220
Why did you hit me too…?

345
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,980
Oi, look over there!

346
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,300
Someone's coming out!

347
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,960
Look! On her back!

348
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,790
W-Wings!

349
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,500
An angel!

350
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,200
So that's a real angel?

351
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,820
She looks like a prune!

352
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,330
E-Excuse us…

353
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,110
I am the appointed lookout of Heaven's Gate, Amazon.

354
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,260
Sightseeing?

355
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,420
Or fighting?

356
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,360
S-Sightseeing would be closer, I guess…

357
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,800
We wanna go to Sky Island!

358
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,150
Sky Island's on the other side of this gate, right?

359
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,150
What do you mean, fighting?

360
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,710
It doesn't matter which.

361
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,950
Just pay the immigration fee, E1,000,000,000 per person, and be on your way.

362
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,560
That's the law.

363
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,470
1-1,000,000,000!?

364
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,470
There's that extol thing again.

365
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,190
How much is 1,000,000,000 extil in beli?

366
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,710
No matter what it is, 1,000,000,000's gotta be a lot!

367
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,530
1,000,000,000 for one person… 7,000,000,000 for seven people.

368
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,530
We're only going in.

369
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,660
Why does it cost that much to enter?

370
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,450
This old granny must have her wires crossed-

371
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,540
Excuse me, but about the money…

372
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,450
If… If by some chance…

373
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,580
… we didn't have enough…

374
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,380
You can pass.

375
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,420
We can!?

376
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,670
Or, you can also not pass.

377
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,030
I am neither a guardian nor a warrior.

378
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,330
I only listen to your will.

379
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,190
Okay, let's go!

380
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,370
Let's go to Sky Island!

381
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,590
We don't have any money, but we're going through, Granny!

382
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,280
I see! Seven of you, yes?

383
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,860
Yeah, but…

384
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,170
How do we get up to Sky Island-?

385
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,390
Something's coming up!

386
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,820
Inhabitant of the White Sea, the Speedy Shrimp.

387
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,200
W-We started moving!

388
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,380
Whoa! A huge shrimp!

389
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,830
It's going up the fall!

390
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,770
Hold on tight!

391
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,060
This thing's fast!

392
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,010
It goes all the way to the top!

393
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,910
I, Keeper of Heaven's Gate, Amazon…

394
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,990
… call to the Priests of the almighty God!

395
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,270
Into God's Domain, Skypiea, seven individuals have now illegally entered!

396
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,480
Bestow upon them Heaven's Judgement!

397
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,820
Bestow upon them Heaven's Judgement!

398
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,150
At the time, these guys were crying and had given up on thier lives, but I told them :

1
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,770
You knew at the end of the ocean there was a fabulous treasure?

2
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,610
That which will find it will become the Lord of the Pirates.

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,220
Es you as excited as me?

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,880
There are incredible adventures which await nothing any more but us!

5
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,890
Uncle fortress, with the next one!

6
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,660
He, it is me!

7
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,150
Lock up it!

8
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,460
You should thank Robin.

9
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,610
I see, all will be well with Zoro to my sides.

10
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,710
It would be preferable not to carry out of investigation by here.

11
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,500
There is only one exit.

12
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:25,390
The desperate decision of Luffy and Sanji!
The army maneuvers of rescue!

13
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,890
Parmis the members of the crew of Straw hat who were located,

14
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,370
Some infiltrated and claim to be members of the marine.

15
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,850
Listen! You can act as good seems to you.

16
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,900
If you notice somebody of suspect, apprehend it.

17
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,460
Yes!

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,500
You ace heard Ca? The type with the long conk… made party of the crew of Straw hat.

19
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,020
Ouais. But why this type did come here in particular?

20
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,180
Indeed. the gulf conceals much better boats.

21
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,200
It could have subtilized any of them.

22
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,910
They are like that the pirates, they have the eccentric ideas.

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,070
It is quite true!

24
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,500
What does it arrive to you? You do not work today?

25
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,020
I get old from now on.

26
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,550
It is old.

27
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,920
But it pète the form.

28
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,930
Species of large cretin! Test to be more discrete.

29
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,080
D-sorry.

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,470
Nothing to make. This fortress is a true hell.

31
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,370
Where can be Zoro and Ussop well?

32
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,990
They are without any doubt in prison.

33
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,590
Well! Then direction the prison.

34
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,890
You know at least or is the prison?

35
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,060
Do Sanji, you know or it is?

36
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,850
I know anything of it

37
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,490
perhaps that it is on the suspect island.

38
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,900
What makes you say Ca?

39
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,990
Intuition.

40
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,830
It is a well kept place, that does not make the shade of a doubt.

41
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,330
The zone is taken out of clipper by the sea.

42
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,070
The only means of fleeing, it is to take the bridge.

43
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,830
Even if it is shitting, will throw a glance.

44
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,570
Included/understood.

45
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,470
Shit. One cannot go into reverse any more now.

46
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,210
Yes, here the zone F N°4 building. Nothing to announce.

47
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,850
Remain vigilant.

48
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:57,970
Yes.

49
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,970
They are informed of the situation in one nothing time with their apparatuses.

50
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,580
It is without exit.

51
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,720
With the Sanji fact.

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,540
Hein?

53
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,460
I am too excited.

54
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,590
Continue to advance, cretin of monkey!

55
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,250
Where am…

56
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,220
Do not move any more.

57
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,630
It is bizzare… The entry and the exit of the ships were chamboulées.

58
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,920
why?

59
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,010
I am supervised.

60
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,890
He, what you foutez?!

61
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,900
For which take to me you?!

62
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,880
They say all the same thing…

63
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,610
You claim to be the special inspector, lieutenant Shepard, not?

64
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,710
If you know it then let me leave!

65
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,130
I wish entretenie with the commander Jonasan.

66
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,460
lieutenant Shepard?

67
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,050
I see. Robin usurped his identity to him.

68
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,720
The navy regards it as one as of ours.

69
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,210
I am brilliant!

70
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,660
Go gives up, that is not used for nothing.

71
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,730
In tan that man you must know to recognize your defeat.

72
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,250
It is not worthwhile to be efferayé.

73
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,470
Coéquipié Konteriano.

74
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,550
Kon… Konteriano?

75
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,740
It is what Ca?!

76
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,150
And then be to you which?

77
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,650
Stop your conneries.

78
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,150
How may it be that you can forget your own name and my face?

79
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,880
Break! I do not see what you speak!

80
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,020
I do not know this type!

81
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,340
What does it take to you?

82
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,950
Impossible, would you have lost the memory during your fall of the bridge?

83
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,120
It is… It is too sad.

84
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,970
He, please! Take it along elsewhere.

85
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,680
This type is not any more as of ours, dear Konteriano!

86
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,780
I am not able to decide to me.

87
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,340
I include/understand better why it was made pass for the inspector.

88
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,970
I said anything, me.

89
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,700
Wait, what you will make ego?!

90
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,610
Wait, wait, you do not include/understand?!

91
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,030
Konteriano!

92
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,240
Is Konteriano, it which?

93
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,370
Mets out of silencing device!

94
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,100
Played well, Zoro!

95
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,520
They fell into the panel…! Of thanking me Robin will be necessary to think.

96
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,480
Exaggerate you a little too much, Ussop.

97
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,650
Commander. We did not succeed in yet locating Straw hat.

98
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,590
What do we have to make now, commander?

99
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,310
Did they find the site of the prison?

100
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,380
If it is not the case let reach that point.

101
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,800
hein?

102
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,910
Penetrate there and hide you over there.

103
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,620
And have patience until their arrival.

104
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,580
Now, let us leave the their initiative of the offensive.

105
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,440
What you insane, Sanji?

106
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,460
Shit.

107
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,800
I have the impression that one will have to pass in force.

108
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,850
How is it made that nobody supervises on this side?

109
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,770
Allons-y Luffy, by here.

110
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,590
Hello?

111
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,820
I am with the report/ratio.

112
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,250
Us venos to apprehend a suspect.

113
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,210
We think that it makes party of the crew of Straw hat, under the name of Konteriano.

114
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,630
Konteriano?

115
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,820
Yes.

116
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,590
It tried to be made pass for lieutenant Shepard

117
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,510
But I was right not to believe it.

118
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,570
Hum… Good job.

119
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,330
Two Shepard?

120
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,180
It left…

121
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:25,190
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

122
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:32,250
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

123
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,010
He Zoro, you ace not the impression which it is woven something of strange?

124
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,490
Ouais, there is like funny amtmosphére.

125
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,570
Hein? But it is…

126
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,630
You are…

127
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,320
The old mechanic-san?

128
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,670
What you factories here?

129
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,220
Nothing the whole… Arrange your… your

130
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,890
Arrange your sabers!

131
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,210
I see.

132
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,500
What you ace at the head?

133
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,630
Ca is not looked at. I seek the type with the long nose.

134
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,660
Wait. Ca is not made go to discuss pépère with a criminal.

135
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,350
Ca will not be long, look at.

136
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,670
Yo!

137
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,940
Ah, you are…

138
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,450
To does the fact Going Merry go well?

139
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,180
Do not worry you. Your boat is well.

140
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,890
At least until now.

141
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,690
I am relieved.

142
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,610
It is you who had rafistolé the boat?

143
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,750
Hein? Heu… Exact.

144
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,740
I do not like too your way of the bidouiller.

145
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,710
How can you plan to make good repairs without cup?

146
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,520
It could break in thousand pieces at the time of a storm.

147
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,600
A cup?

148
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,240
You do not know what it is?

149
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,180
In fact I am not naval engineer.

150
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,610
I am unaware of who repaired it this night there.

151
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,010
Nobody would be able to give it in state in only one night.

152
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,870
It was when we were on the celestial island to 10 km with the top of the ground.

153
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,270
To 10 km?

154
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,430
Ouais, ouais, nobody does not want to believe us.

155
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,480
What means that this boat fell from the sky.

156
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Wah, you believe us?!

157
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,380
I was there at the time of your arrival, it is for Ca that I believe you

158
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,080
If the angle of fall is taken, I can affirm
that it comes from a place located in height.

159
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,760
It is true.

160
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
I saw full with incredible things on the celestial island.

161
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,660
A god, angels and full with other things.

162
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,400
A god and angels?

163
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,800
You already tasted with death?

164
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,490
I tested full with tricks but not yet death.

165
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,010
Well, let us return to our sheep.

166
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,600
Did that which repaired it appear… right in the middle of the fog?

167
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,700
It, how do you know it is exact?

168
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,210
In fact do, you know who it act?

169
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,470
If what you say is true, then it acts…

170
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,460
What do you foutez?

171
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,290
Ca is enough, old man.

172
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,090
We still have bread on the board.

173
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,800
Take it along.

174
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,680
He, He!

175
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,740
Have-await, I want to know!
It is which this person?

176
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,700
I forgot a very important thing.

177
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,850
Listen, length-conk.

178
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,860
When you repair your ship, you must pay the attention to least the details…

179
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,080
in order to know the site exact of repairs to be carried out there.

180
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,550
If you like your ship… Then does not forget my councils.

181
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,870
They is good, you ace included/understood?!

182
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,970
Ouais, it is well included/understood, Ossan! Thank you!

183
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,600
Somebody has just left there.

184
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,520
Voice thus the exact site.

185
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,750
Good, one sinks.

186
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,770
Wait, wait, there is a trick which bell.

187
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,590
While taking this way, nobody followed us.

188
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,590
And finally we arrived here.

189
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,510
It is too easy.

190
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,390
I included/understood.

191
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,530
Uncle fortress is in fact a nice uncle.

192
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,500
It is an ambush I say to you.

193
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,420
Your sympathetic uncle, it wants to make us fall into a trap by involving us towards the prison.

194
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,840
But it is not a bad thing.

195
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,680
And then if one does not go there, how one will make to release Zoro and Ussop?

196
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,620
Imbecile! Did not fall so niaisement into the trap from the enemy.

197
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,400
notice, it would be better that one infiltrates directly instead of turning around the pot.

198
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,440
And then I am worried too much by the state of Nami-san and Robin-chan.

199
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,720
Are Sanji, to you reflecting?

200
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,220
Not!

201
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,900
You reflect.

202
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,470
I said to you that not!

203
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,210
It is what this place?

204
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,310
Go ahead, dispatch you and enters.

205
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,680
Ouais.

206
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,230
He, Zoro, Ussop! You are where?

207
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,480
It was the voice of Luffy at the moment.

208
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,500
Ooooé!

209
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,860
It is well Luffy.

210
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,120
He, Luffy by here!

211
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,140
You think that will go? We are disarmed I you signal.

212
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,810
Do not come, not, do not come by there!

213
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,790
What should I say to him?

214
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,630
Will know, I do not have the least idea of it.

215
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,190
Reconsider your steps!

216
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,480
From which did the voice come?

217
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,710
By here!

218
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,130
They came.

219
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,530
Pay Luffy to.

220
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,860
They are there, wait I will draw you from there.

221
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,480
Ca must be Ca Kairoseki!

222
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,560
Lastly, you were awaited.

223
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,200
You would make well return to you, Straw hat.

224
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,040
You underestimate us.

225
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,480
You think that it will be sufficient to have to us?

226
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,300
Ca will be useless.

227
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,860
Thin. It is the same thing bandages cretins.

228
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,350
What will one well be able to make now?

229
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,750
Above all…

230
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,050
What is this that it makes?

231
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,100
It is not worthwhile.

232
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,070
It is impossible to come to end from these bars even with a gun.

233
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,720
Fact of shitting. It is what these bars?

234
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,420
Canon… I see.

235
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,770
Sanji, come by here.

236
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,190
The trick at the bottom of my pocket catches.

237
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,290
Your pocket?

238
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,180
Impact-Dial.

239
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,620
Use it to destroy the bars.

240
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,330
Impact-Dial? The type which uses it finds wounded then…

241
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,190
Would not be stupid.

242
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,250
Go quickly, take it.

243
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,210
What do they still manigancent?

244
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,180
Appointment!

245
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,440
Wait a little, the gorilla. I will show you something of very special.

246
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,530
A shell?

247
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,010
With this shell there, be remotely held hearth of impact.

248
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,550
step back…

249
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,050
It left.

250
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,170
You speak about the flexible snake.

251
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,400
Large idiot.

252
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,920
It is what? Is this your secret weapon there?

253
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,150
If you add a word I kill you.

254
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,660
Frightening! It is really opposed.

255
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,910
Ah, Sanji-kun, forgiveness! It is the other pocket.

256
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,910
It is here… here… here.

257
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,410
How that drives back!

258
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,510
Shit!

259
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,920
C-Ca…

260
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,770
Whip too much…

261
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,920
Who pété in my dial?

262
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
E-excuse me.

263
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,030
Why you ace pété elsewhere?

264
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,360
Good blood, Ca will jump. With cover.

265
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,240
Explosion announced in the prison!

266
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,800
You gather, quickly!

267
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,140
Does He, Ca go?

268
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,720
Did the escape… succeed…?

269
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,140
Ca has all the air of it.

270
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,210
I have too badly.

271
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,190
Putin, too be to you shitting.

272
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,050
There are not any more time to lose.

273
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,700
We from here of speed draw.

274
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,160
Thank you.

275
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,650
One goes there, Luffy.

276
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,830
Very well!

277
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,790
One mets veils immediately!

278
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,090
Wait, wait.

279
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,740
Do not let Zoro guide us, or pommer is risked.

280
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,110
Ussop… Dumb.

281
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,220
Is everyone well?

282
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,040
O-Oui, Ca could better be.

283
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,250
Well, all the soldiers still in state, follow me.

284
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,530
One leaves to the continuation Straw hat.

285
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,560
Imbeciles, Ca grouille soldiers outside

286
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,520
This time I will send to you in prison for good.

287
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,950
What?

288
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,570
One lost oneself.

289
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,020
It is what this place?

290
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,650
It is deceived it does not have any direction of the orientation!

291
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,170
Your mouths!

292
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,920
Commander, I am sorry!

293
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,910
Straw hat succeeded in escaping to us.

294
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,700
And where is the remainder of dryness companions?

295
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,620
Is Roronoa with them?

296
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,010
Yes. Heu…

297
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,420
The guards said that only Konteriano did not succeed in being withdrawn.

298
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,870
I see. Major, take care to reinforce the guard on the bridge.

299
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,310
O-Oui.

300
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:35,480
Of made you not. There are still several opportunities of putting the hand above to them.

301
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,350
The others finally reacted.

302
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,030
Rat-trap?

303
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,730
Do not import, it perhaps will do without something funny.

304
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,330
To think of something of shitting, it is shitting.

305
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,310
Let us see what it is like trap.

306
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,260
Do you think of being able to escape to you from Navarone?

307
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,130
And of Jonasan?

308
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,550
One will not be made take because we are pirates.

309
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,870
Prochaienement in One part:

310
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:31,230
Participation of the special unit in the war. The offensive battle of the bridge!

311
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,380
I will become the lord of the pirates!

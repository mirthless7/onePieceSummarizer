4
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:48,810
Mochi Maki at The Castle. The Big Race!

5
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:48,810
The Red Nose's Plot.

6
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,330
Here, in Grand Jipang, the joyous New Year has come.

7
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,700
Oh, how great it is.

8
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,900
Let's quit being so busy now that the year has come to an end.

9
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,160
Well, let's just take it easy, shall we?

10
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,870
The new year has only just begun anyway.

11
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,300
What the?! Did I speak too soon?

12
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,180
There's already chaos!

13
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,230
Move! Move! Move! Clear the road!

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,540
You don't have to shout so loud like that, Onami-san.

15
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,250
Huh?

16
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,610
No one's walking around.

17
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,320
Oh, that's true.

18
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,780
The sun's already up, but it's
almost like the whole town is empty.

19
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,200
I wonder if everyone's still sleeping.

20
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,690
Oh, please!

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
What are you rambling on about, Sensei?

22
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,350
Everyone's already headed to the castle.

23
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,820
Today is Grand Jipang's one and only Mochi Maki Race day.

24
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,820
Mochi Maki: Scattering of pounded rice cakes.

25
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,540
If you live in this town, then you drop everything to participate.

26
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,430
Really? Just like that?

27
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,800
Anyway, since it's Mochi Maki,
then they can't start anything without the mochi.

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,760
That also means that the trust in our shop depends on this.

29
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,430
Hurry to the castle please!

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,680
Sign: For the castle

31
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,680
Gotcha!

32
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,830
But doesn't a Mochi Maki usually
 take place at a temple or a shrine?

33
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,130
Here the Tono-sama scatters it at the castle.

34
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,130
Tono-sama: Feudal Lord

35
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,670
Every year people go so crazy fighting for it that some people even die.

36
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,650
What?!

37
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,690
He's lying, Sensei. People don't die.

38
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,030
Yeah, but that Strawhat Oyabun...
You never know what he's capable of.

39
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,370
I wonder if someone's talking about me...

40
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,510
I can see that about Oyabun, but I didn't know
the people in this town also liked to eat so much.

41
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,170
That's not it, Sensei.

42
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,640
Everyone's trying to get the jackpot mochi, not the regular mochi.

43
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,600
The jackpot?

44
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,820
That's right!

45
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,010
Within the thousands and thousands of mochis that are scattered from the very top of the castle's roof,

46
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,600
There is just one jackpot included.

47
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,390
And inside it, a diamond was placed.

48
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,050
And rumor has it this treasure's worth over 10 million ryou-beli!

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,050
Ryou: unit of currency used in Edo-era Japan

50
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,570
What do you think? Isn't that great?

51
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,450
That is definitely something we'd like to have.

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,040
But how can we tell the difference
between the jackpot and the regular mochi?

53
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,500
I don't know. I've never actually seen it myself either.

54
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,710
Hey! Do you know?

55
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,420
No, I don't.

56
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,100
I guess you just have to gather
as many as you can and open them up.

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,260
It's almost like trying to catch a cloud, isn't it?

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,810
If I get the jackpot, I'm gonna buy lots of books!

59
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,480
I wanna go somewhere with everyone from the nagaya.

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,480
Nagaya: Tenement House

61
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,990
Hey, are you open for business this morning already?

62
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,830
Today is the seventh so I'm serving Nana Kusa Gayu.

63
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,830
Nana Kusa Gayu: Rice porridge with Nana Kusa leaves.
Japanese have special types of food to eat on specific days after the new year.

64
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,990
Would you like a serving, Danna?

65
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,790
Food merchants call people from their shops referring to men as Danna and women as Okusan.

66
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,570
I guess so.

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,220
Oi, Usopp!

68
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,740
That's not fair that only you get to eat!

69
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,940
I'm eating too!

70
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,900
You can't Oyabun!

71
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,850
You have to stay up there and keep watching!

72
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,130
You can't scatter kayu, so you'll just have to wait...

73
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,120
What... what is this?!

74
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,720
Oh, here it comes! Thanks!

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,420
Oyabun, once you eat that,
go around to the front to keep watching, ok?

76
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,510
Jeez.

77
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,680
You must be busy.

78
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,150
Yeah, well, the jackpot is 10 million ryou-beli, you know.

79
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,600
It won't be surprising if greedy folks get ideas in their heads and try something.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,710
A jackpot that we don't even know where it'll fall...

81
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,780
How could I just stand there just waiting for it?

82
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,890
There's a much more sure way of getting our hands on it.

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,330
In other words...

84
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,440
We'll just take all the mochi before it even gets scattered from the castle!

85
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,950
That way, we'll definitely get the jackpot.

86
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,990
No doubt!

87
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,520
Boys, steal them flashily!

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,360
There's no way to escape on top of the bridge!

89
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,830
Damn! And we are almost at the castle too!

90
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,950
We don't have time to turn back, you two.

91
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,870
Here we go, Sensei!

92
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,420
That was close.

93
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,370
You're pretty skilled.

94
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,860
Onami, that was harsh...

95
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,050
Got one.

96
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,480
Sensei, behind you!

97
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,270
Mellorine! Mellorine!

98
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,830
Ritchie.

99
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,770
Why you...

100
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,080
Stop, damn it!

101
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,700
If you wanna live, then leave everything behind...

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
Okashira, they escaped.

103
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,710
Okashira: Boss

104
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,310
It's too late!

105
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,720
They'll get into the castle

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,880
before we can catch up to them.

107
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,220
Shut up!

108
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,820
It's 10 million ryou-beli.

109
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,680
There's no way I'm giving up.

110
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,180
But...

111
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,130
I won't let them escape...

112
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,490
My next move is already in motion anyway.

113
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,840
You got that?!

114
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,830
Now you morons get outta there and get ready!

115
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,910
Father...

116
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,070
It seems pretty festive below already.

117
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:53,820
Yes.

118
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,320
It seems that everyone can't wait.

119
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,610
Yes, and by the way, it seems the
most important thing, the mochi, isn't here yet.

120
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,810
Yes...

121
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,240
I've been having someone look out for it...

122
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,400
But there's no word yet.

123
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,440
Perhaps something happened on the way...

124
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,090
I'm a bit worried.

125
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,580
Is that right?

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,250
The shop keepers are your friends, right?

127
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,420
Maybe it would be better to send someone to get them.

128
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,540
They said they'd rather get paid more for not accepting our help with security...

129
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,070
So I just did as they asked, but...

130
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,390
I wonder if Onami-san and the others are okay...

131
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,680
Here they come.

132
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,450
Onami, you're late!

133
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,620
Mochi is better freshly pounded, you know.

134
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,800
What's up with that kite?

135
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,390
We're floating in the air.

136
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,510
Hold on tight.

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,110
They were waiting for us again, huh?

138
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,670
Who the hell are you?

139
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,100
Well, probably from the Buggy clan, anyway.

140
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,380
Tako-ni-mo.

141
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,370
Play on words: Tako: Octopus or Kite.
Ni-mo: also. Ika-ni-mo: Exactly. Ika: Squid.

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,360
Ika-ni-mo.

143
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,030
On Buggy Oyabun's orders, we are taking all of your mochi.

144
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,020
My name is Hachi.

145
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,100
Nice to meet you.

146
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,840
And here is one more.

147
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm known as Gedatsu, the Buggy clan's Martial Arts specialist!

148
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,790
Don't worry.

149
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,990
As long as we can have the mochi,

150
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,140
We won't do anything to you.

151
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,130
I'll let you down.

152
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,270
You've gotta be kidding...

153
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,780
If we made it this far and couldn't deliver,

154
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,700
We'd lose all trust in our shop.

155
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,460
Do something, Sanji-kun!

156
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,460
There's nothing I can really do in this situation...

157
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,610
Ah, save me!

158
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,100
Oi, oi, don't move around.

159
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,240
It's not my fault if you fall.

160
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,570
You mochi thief!

161
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,060
Give it up!

162
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,020
Gomu Gomu no...

163
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,180
Idiot, don't hang onto me so tightly!

164
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,090
Why am I falling too?

165
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,560
Oh, I should have let go of the kite's string...

166
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,030
How careless!

167
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,660
It's alright now.

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,310
No, it isn't. The wagon!

169
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,540
Those bastards.

170
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,470
Look you morons!

171
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,750
The mochi's gonna roll right into our laps.

172
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,510
The jackpot is mine!

173
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,330
Igaram-san.

174
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,640
Chaka. Pell.

175
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,540
The wagon!

176
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,390
Yessir!

177
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,800
Damn you, getting in the way!

178
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,850
Who cares... get them!

179
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,080
What are you morons doing?

180
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,920
But Okashira... this heavy load on a hill is...

181
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,820
Let's rest for a bit.

182
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,710
Stop blabbering nonsense and go after them!

183
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,670
Oyabin-dono, are you alright?

184
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,570
Yes.

185
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,730
Now, we've delivered your order as promised.

186
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,690
Thank you for your hard work.

187
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
What about the payment?

188
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,750
We get it right now, right?

189
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,160
This job was a lot harder than we tought, so...

190
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,580
About that...

191
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,890
I.O.U. - I owe you

192
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,890
Hey now, we don't take I.O.U.'s from the castle.

193
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,080
Vivi-sama said that she would deliver it herself to the shop tomorrow.

194
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,220
Wait till then.

195
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,170
Please, excuse me.

196
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,120
Please tell Vivi to come anytime.

197
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,310
Those idiots still haven't given up!

198
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,740
It's okay, Sanji-kun.

199
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,010
Let's head over to the festival venue.

200
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,090
We can just leave the rest to the castle staff.

201
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,810
Hey, Oyabun.

202
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,220
If we can't have the Mochi Maki,

203
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,170
You'll be banned from the shop, ok?

204
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,930
You better work hard!

205
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,440
Okashira! They're already in the castle!

206
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,870
Shut up, I don't care, just keep going!

207
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,480
Here we go, flashily!

208
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,980
Did the Mochi Maki already start?

209
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,070
I'm late!

210
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,050
FIXME: Background talking (I'm not sure what they're saying - SD)

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,880
It's the Buggy family!

212
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,260
They are after the mochi.

213
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,250
What are you doing?

214
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,010
Hurry up!

215
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,180
Oi! Where's the festival venue?

216
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,680
Huh? Oh, it's you!

217
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,300
Great meeting you here.

218
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,510
Can you give me a hand?

219
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,090
There are some mochi thieves causing commotion inside.

220
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,000
What?!

221
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,260
How dare they infringe on the moshi I've been so looking forward to?

222
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,960
Where the hell are the mochi thieves?!

223
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,630
That way!

224
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,310
Yosh!

225
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,600
How dare they?

226
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,490
Cursed idiots!

227
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,310
That mochi is mine!

228
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,570
Oi, oi. Not you too.

229
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,240
Mochi thieves!

230
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,950
I'm gonna catch you no matter what!

231
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,450
Where's the mochi?!

232
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,890
I won't let them tear the castle apart any more than this!

233
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,590
Well, I know there they're headed.

234
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,050
Leave the shortcut to me!

235
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,980
Let's just hurry and catch up to them, Bou-san.

236
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,980
Bou-san: Priest

237
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,750
Oi, Usopp.

238
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,730
Who do you keep talking to?

239
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,460
Oh, Oyabun!

240
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,830
What do you mean who?

241
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,200
It's...

242
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
What?! He's not here.

243
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,120
When did this happen?

244
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,520
Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead!

245
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,240
Jeez, he's so unreliable.

246
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,190
Where did that Bou-san go?

247
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,940
Where's the mochi?!

248
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,040
O-oi...

249
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,040
Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Oh my!

250
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,980
Ama-san dono, are you alright?

251
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,550
Someone help!

252
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,820
What's wrong?

253
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,770
It's the thief!

254
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,760
You pervert!

255
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,770
What the hell did I do?

256
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,130
Wait!

257
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,110
Yosh, I don't care what you do.

258
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,120
Just get in there!

259
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,420
Okashira!

260
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,160
Hold it right there, Buggy clan.

261
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,700
I will not tolerate any more violence in this castle.

262
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,730
Prepare yourselves.

263
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,310
Oh? Well, well.

264
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,790
If it isn't the princesss herself welcoming us.

265
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,180
Sorry to trouble you!

266
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,480
You don't know the Bara Bara fruit's ability?

267
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,480
Bara: Split

268
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,370
That's what you get for meddling.

269
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,020
Oh, but don't get me wrong.

270
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,740
I didn't come here for her.

271
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,630
I came for the jackpot mochi.

272
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,590
Bring that wagon from earlier here, right now!

273
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,750
We'll do a trade.

274
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:38,230
Hurry up, or else I'll break the princess's neck!

275
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,930
Wait, we got it.

276
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,810
We have no choice but to do as he says.

277
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,610
Looks like the underling know better, huh?

278
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,280
Alright!

279
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,410
You, bring the wagon!

280
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,240
Yeah, but the jackpot's not on that wagon.

281
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,050
Then where is it?

282
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,270
The jackpot mochi is...

283
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,270
No!

284
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,580
The Tono-sama has it.

285
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,670
Is that right?

286
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,210
There it is.

287
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,830
Y-you're really giving it to me so easily?!

288
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,600
It's alright.

289
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,270
IT'S EMPTY!

290
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,700
Hey, so that's where he was, that big-nose.

291
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,800
You bastard!

292
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,040
You decieved me flashily.

293
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,430
Buggy, look out the window, down below.

294
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,300
Hey! Don't break the castle!

295
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,080
Oi, Big-nose! I'm not gonna let you have the jackpot!

296
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,680
But I told you! It's empty!

297
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,190
I'll make you cry you bastard.

298
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,520
Listen, below are those that have been looking forward to this Mochi Maki.

299
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,970
And they are all gathered together.

300
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,930
This tradition is a stimulation of the New Year's economic growth, a test of luck.

301
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,780
Whether you win or not is up to luck,

302
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,440
But the opportunity to test that luck has to be given equally to everyone.

303
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,430
So I can't give that opportunity to just one person.

304
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,170
If you want the jackpot,

305
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,000
Then you need to go below along with everyone else,

306
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,660
And wait for the Mochi Maki to begin.

307
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,370
As expected from the Tono-sama.

308
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,300
A marvelous persuasion.

309
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,370
Hey, Tono-sama.

310
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,770
Let's start already.

311
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,370
If we don't hurry, Onami's gonna kill me!

312
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,800
Hey, you insolent fool.

313
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,430
How dare you speak to the Tono that way!

314
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,480
Forget it!

315
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,920
I don't want anything that cheap.

316
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,430
Making fool of me...

317
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,210
I found something much better, Tono-sama.

318
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,310
If I get rid of you, instead of the 10 million ryou-beli jackpot,

319
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,340
This whole country would be mine!

320
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,360
Now that we've come to this, I'll just blow you away flashily.

321
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,970
Boys, ready the Buggy Special Bomb!

322
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,170
Yessir!

323
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,720
I'll make you regret making a fool of me.

324
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
Brace yourselves!

325
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,850
We've finished the preparation.

326
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,230
Alrighty, then!

327
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,370
Go ahead and fire it!

328
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,740
It's mochi.

329
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,840
The Mochi Maki has begun.

330
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,070
You bastards...!

331
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,610
The jackpot may be mixed in with the ones we just shot.

332
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,880
No, he said that wasn't necessary.

333
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,530
You bastards, stop amusing yourselves.

334
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,420
You're in the way.

335
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,510
Fly away!

336
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,080
Thank you for your hard work!

337
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,080
You guys know what to do, right?

338
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,080
No matter what, you have to get the jackpot!

339
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,080
Of course!

340
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,410
The walls of this mighty castle of alabaster,

341
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,160
With a thousand years of history,

342
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,300
Have three huge holes.

343
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,470
And it's all because...

344
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,800
Hey, strawhat!

345
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,270
If you're looking for Luffy-san,

346
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,260
He already went down below to gather mochi.

347
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,020
What's wrong, Igaram?

348
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,600
Won't you throw some mochi too?

349
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,730
This is no time for that, Tono!

350
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,630
The walls of our proud castle have been destroyed!

351
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,500
This has never happened before.

352
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,640
This is a disgrace.

353
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,800
Where is the disgrace?

354
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,570
What?!

355
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,750
Look, Igaram.

356
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,050
See how happy everyone looks.

357
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,740
A country is it's people.

358
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,630
It's the hard work of all the people that makes the country.

359
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,700
Just because the castle's appearance may have been destroyed a bit,

360
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,360
It doesn't mean that the country has been weakened.

361
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,540
As long as the people are filled with happiness, then so is the country.

362
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,930
That's also our responsibility as well.

363
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,050
We did run into a few problems,

364
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,230
But in the end everyone's happy.

365
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,100
So it's alright, isn't it?

366
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,470
A country is it's people.

367
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,950
It truly is.

368
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,340
Right, Igaram?

369
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,170
Yes, it is.

370
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,680
But, Tono, who's going to pay for this incident?

371
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,160
We will.

372
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,330
That's being way too greedy, Oyabun...

373
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,820
This isn't it.

374
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,390
Where's the jackpot?

375
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,940
Onami, I can't eat anymore.

376
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,690
Thanks fot waiting! I got some more!

377
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,900
NO WAY!

378
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,090
By the way, father, where's the jackpot?

379
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,240
Oh, that's right.

380
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,290
I almost forgot.

381
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,120
Now, I wonder who's going to get their hands on this.

382
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,380
Go!

383
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,290
I finally got some mochi.

384
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:57,970
Thank you!

385
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,770
What the hell is this?

386
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,570
A mochi with a seed inside?

387
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,640
I can't eat this shit!

388
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:08,770
Oh dear.

389
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,480
He has no greed.

390
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Happy New Year!

391
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,220
Next episode on One Piece:

392
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,560
Kalifa, the Bubble User!

393
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,980
The Soap Trap Aproaches Nami

394
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,290
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

395
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,290

1
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:00,420
Determination of Coby and Helmeppo!

2
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:00,420
Pride of father of the Garp vice-admiral

3
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,010
Aahh! Here they are!

4
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,460
The million inhabitants of Little Garden

5
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,710
wishing me welcome,
me the Usopp-Sama captain!

6
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,560
Scented breeze of the girls carrying their impetuous kisses!

7
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,190
“Honestly, I know that I am only one man among others.

8
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,140
But you can only fall in love with me, small.

9
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,960
It will not be my fault if one embraces oneself… “

10
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,350
Be to you idiot or what?

11
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,270
Does Ca mean what this “idiot”, Zoro?

12
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,290
The farm!
You cannot be quieter?

13
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,860
Good blood…

14
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,600
Forgiveness! Forgiveness! We said?

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,100
I said in short that even if there are no islands in the corner,

16
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,400
the coral reefs are rather important, therefore there is always a risk to break the hull.

17
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,700
I include/understand.

18
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,920
Thank you.

19
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,280
I will keep that in memory.

20
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,820
Of nothing.

21
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,300
Ah! Ca feels good!

22
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,660
Afflicted to have made you wait.

23
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,250
The dessert of today:tart with pears.

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,830
You level Misses.

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,450
Ouahou! Ca with the delicious air!

26
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,150
Your place is over there!

27
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,650
'silvering…

28
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,490
Where is Luffy?

29
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,110
Oh, I asked him to bring back water so that I can take a shower.

30
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,240
It must be with the récolteuse water machine.

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,850
Ah, it is thus for that which it is so calm.

32
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,680
Or perhaps not…

33
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,610
Eh well, I was afraid!

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,570
This thing is dangerous!

35
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,140
What? What did it occur?

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,390
How did you break that?

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,920
I just tried to make so that the water harvest is done more quickly.

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,910
The belt broke.

39
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,820
Is Ouais, it odd not?

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,550
It is because of your stupid force.

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,890
Good blood…

42
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,880
Can it be repaired?

43
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,450
Yes, one must stop and find spare parts.

44
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,440
In other words, I will not request anything any more from this type.

45
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,160
Usopp?

46
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,410
Can you use the other récolteuse water machine for me to bring some?

47
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,310
Of course!

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,090
Salt plague of Nami!
Why you do not do it yourself?

49
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,510
I felt food.

50
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,090
And you bastard, you have no feel responsibilities!

51
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,540
I said that I was sorry.

52
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,400
In losing one it is not large thing…

53
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,940
Nami-San, looks at!

54
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,190
Oh, the deliveryman of newspapers.

55
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,460
You two close it!!

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,730
Shit, cursed Nami…

57
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,530
But why the newspaper of the morning always arrives during the pause of midday?

58
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,860
Nothing there can. One sails on Grand Line, I recall you.

59
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,410
We should be grateful to have already information.

60
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,460
You are right on this point.

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,630
Did you find an article interesting?

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,090
Not, not!

63
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,270
Not really…

64
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,880
What?

65
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,170
Ca! Look at that Zoro!

66
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,200
What is there?
It is right a photograph of Navy.

67
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,930
Yes, but the guy on the photograph is not no matter who.

68
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,610
It is Coby!

69
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,770
Ouais!

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,350
Do Coby you say? It is the friend with whom you travelled front?

71
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,960
Ouais!

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,930
Well, what that known as?

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,670
Let us see seeing…

74
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,990
“The cruiser of the Garp vice-admiral arrived at the General headquarter of the Navy.

75
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,770
This photo was taken after their descent of Mountain Reverse.

76
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,020
The Garp vice-admiral posted his usual confidence in him.

77
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,320
But some young Navy seemed terrified. “

78
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,040
Here!

79
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,530
Then Coby succeeded in reaching Grand Line!

80
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,020
To start with the General headquarter of the Navy on Large Line,

81
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,480
it is not badly.

82
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,440
Of course, a Coby day will be the mayor of the Navy.

83
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,970
Pas le mayor, cretin!

84
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,350
An Officer recommended.
A Naval officer!

85
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,310
Yes, it is what I wanted to say.

86
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,700
Ouais, it must really give itself evil, him too!

87
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,710
Navy!

88
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,620
2000 pumps! Start!

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,710
100 crossings of cord!

90
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,160
200 turns!

91
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,940
All those which will not finish in the hour will have 100 turns of penalty!

92
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,490
Drive of fencing!

93
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,540
Do not release absolutely anything!

94
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,690
Does that go?

95
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,800
It is thus that the General headquarter of the Navy?

96
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,140
Well, they will not find us here.

97
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,690
Rest a little there please.

98
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,770
Ouais…. Afflicted…

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,390
He Coby.

100
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,540
What is there?

101
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,090
Don't you think only that we are not ready for this place?

102
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,860
You saw these guy over there, presently.

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,620
We are not far but we cannot do it yet.

104
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,730
There is an order in all that, you know.

105
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,240
We should return after us to be, at least, trained a little bit…

106
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,500
Yes, it is that! Let us do that!

107
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,880
Even if we leave, nobody…

108
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,700
Wait a little!

109
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,310
With what do think you, Helmeppo-San?

110
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,380
You were not to exceed your father?

111
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,240
Eh well yes… but…

112
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,470
If I were to make all the tricks here, I would die about it.

113
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,250
You do not wish it?

114
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,920
If you chose to do it…

115
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,220
I will become the Lord of the Pirates!

116
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,800
If you chose to become that…

117
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,800
It is the way which I chose. And for that…

118
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,800
And even if you were to die by beating you, isn't this because you had chosen it?

119
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,320
To beat me? It is not exaggerated a little?

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
You must fight!

121
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,150
Together with me.

122
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,500
Therefore, please, speaks again never again to flee.

123
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,680
“To flee” do you say?

124
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,500
You two!

125
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,650
You were not trying to stab me in the back?

126
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,610
Bandage little runts!

127
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,130
There is full with guy which would be glad to take your place.

128
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,150
If you want to escape, dispatch you and run.

129
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,040
Wait please!

130
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,160
We do not have any intention to flee!

131
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,810
Our determination brought us here.

132
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,250
Order to us to do anything and will do we it,

133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,580
Garp vice-admiral!

134
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,750
You known as that you are ready with all to endure?

135
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,010
It is well what you said?

136
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,230
Your determination brought you here.

137
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,030
It is what you said?

138
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,090
Yes!

139
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,120
Then stop paresser here and turn over to work!

140
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,510
Yes!

141
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,980
I let to you continue to supervise them.

142
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,810
Well!

143
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,460
What? The General headquarter of the Navy?

144
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,420
Yes, as the rumors say it,
the Garp vice-admiral is a little impulsive.

145
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,950
But, it, isn't this is nevertheless extraordinary?

146
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,960
Yes, it is what one says.

147
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,720
Therefore, it must have great waitings with regard to these deux-là.

148
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,610
Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!

149
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,070
Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!

150
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,820
Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!

151
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,950
How did you can let them leave without anything to say?

152
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,310
Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!

153
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,150
Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Couill…

154
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,690
Rika… wants to still play with them.

155
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,390
I wanted to still speak to them…

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,490
I wanted to have a good meal of my hands to them.

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,010
I had even learned how to cook and

158
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,480
I did not even can say to them goodbye…

159
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,720
Euh, I…

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,770
Why were they to leave?

161
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,900
I include/understand! Forgive me!

162
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,130
Rika, forgives him.

163
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,170
They are well.
One day they will return,

164
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,800
as splendid commissioned Officers.

165
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,370
But really…

166
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,240
Will one become Marine by doing all that?

167
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,070
This old dog could do to us that for his hobby just.

168
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,200
A hobby?

169
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,120
Yes. To tire the jeunes gens must be the hobby of this old dog.

170
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,170
It is rather impulsive, therefore you do not believe that it is possible?

171
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,550
Your mouths, stupid volatile!

172
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,810
'is silvering, it fast this old croûton?

173
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,250
It is the Garp vice-admiral.

174
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,140
Did He, you hear?

175
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,650
They call it “Garp the terrible one! ”,

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,100
because everyone is afraid of him.

177
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,470
Eh well, its fists make more badly than those of Alvida…

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Ca does not have anything to see!

179
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,620
Can you stop all these silly things?

180
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,880
Particularly when we are of guard…

181
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,990
I am always punished because of you.

182
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,310
Do not say that.

183
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,730
It is the “responsibility for the regiment”.
The responsibility for the regiment…

184
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,260
We, isn't this is friendly?

185
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,910
You say that only when that arranges you…

186
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,540
If you think it, why don't you work more seriously?

187
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,780
They is good, I will do it!

188
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,060
Not, finally, I from go away!

189
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,660
I want to return to my old lifestyle.

190
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,120
It about that, isn't this does not have there to speak now?

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,950
It is not similar to only become famous while being an elected Officer.

192
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,210
It is that!

193
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,350
What?

194
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,540
I cannot flee!
I should not slacken myself!

195
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,470
Therefore, it is possible only one to turn over to my old lifestyle:

196
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,090
by climbing the levels towards glory!
You do not believe?

197
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,450
What do you want to say by “You do not believe?” ?

198
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,860
Ca will not be also easy, you know.

199
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,660
We must do it gradually.

200
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,170
If you want that is easy for you…

201
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,850
What do you make?

202
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,940
Ca will not be used for nothing to wait there like a zatsuyou.

203
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,570
I will involve myself!

204
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,010
Oh not, not yet!

205
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,980
You cannot do that.

206
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,000
We are both exhausted by the work of this afternoon.

207
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
Go, will sleep!

208
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,090
I decided.

209
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,520
I will become famous and turn over to my old lifestyle.

210
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,160
I even will exceed my father.

211
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,290
Ca will occur like that!

212
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,190
Yes but…

213
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,620
Your body will not support it!

214
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,150
It is impossible! Impossible!
Impossible! Impossible!

215
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,290
If you insist, you will finish by you killing!

216
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,450
If I chose this way,

217
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,380
even if I must die about it, it is what I chose.

218
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,490
Isn't this?

219
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,130
I already decided.

220
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,010
To die would be easier.

221
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,610
If it is what I want to do, then I must do it!

222
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,590
I will also go far I can!

223
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,120
With more, Coby!

224
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,810
Wait please!

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,360
What is there, Coby?

226
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,560
What do I have says?

227
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,440
I swore that I will again not say anything any more pitiful.

228
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,470
You are right.

229
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,380
That does not depend on what one can or not to achieve, but of what one wants.

230
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,240
I have just decided.

231
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,970
Perhaps I do not have the same motivation as you but…

232
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,650
let us use this frame of mind together!

233
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,430
Ca suits me, small bastard!

234
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,310
Therefore, that will be a contest to know which will arrive there the first.

235
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,710
I hoped that you were going to say that.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,010
But I prefer you to say it directly, I will not lose.

237
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,390
Ouais if you want.

238
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,040
I go there! With more!

239
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,610
He, does not leave me behind!

240
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,140
What do I have some to make?
You are not my friend or anything.

241
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,350
Who is concerned with what can arrive to you?

242
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,740
What is it supposed to mean?

243
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,010
You did not stop contradicting you!

244
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,400
1…

245
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,360
2…

246
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,380
1…

247
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,070
2…

248
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,110
1…

249
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,300
2…

250
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,430
1… 2…

251
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,280
1… 2…

252
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,020
1… 2…

253
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,770
1… 2…

254
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,850
1…

255
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,890
Here thus the 30 million Berrys for Luffy to the straw hat?

256
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,450
We must carry out a horrible pirate like him as fast as possible.

257
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,880
Completely.

258
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,110
Luffy-San on a required list…
Does Ca seem strange, not?

259
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,660
Cretin, the pirates are pirates.

260
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,290
If they get caught, they are carried out.
It is like that it goes.

261
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,760
I know it!

262
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,340
But you cannot classify it also easily.

263
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,160
Luffy-San is my friend, you know!

264
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,400
Sink cretin!

265
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,180
No Marine is the friend of a pirate!

266
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,860
Repeat never again that or you will be transfered Navy!

267
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,440
I know it already!

268
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,630
I will not tell it everywhere.

269
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,980
You have interest!

270
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:37,890
Leek!

271
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,020
Garp vice-admiral!!

272
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,330
I heard that you say something of interesting.

273
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,210
Can you speak to me about it?

274
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,490
It is which your friend?

275
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,110
Attention it is necessary to divide!

276
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,790
I you it redemande.

277
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,800
Summers you friends of Luffy to the straw hat?

278
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,050
I do not know for Helmeppo-San,

279
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,360
but for me, yes!

280
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,540
Even if we took different ways, he said to me that we would be always friendly!

281
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,090
You must probably know this,

282
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,320
but the Navy cannot let people like you proclaim such things.

283
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,370
Fortunately for you, I am the only one with being well-informed.

284
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,400
Do you want to be Navy?

285
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,920
Wait please!

286
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,320
I am perhaps the friend of Luffy-San but Helmeppo-San forever…

287
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,510
I am it! I am it!
And it is for that I am there!

288
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,980
Helmeppo-San?

289
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,230
Idiot, I believe that you should have asked it to me front.

290
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,250
It is the responsibility for the regiment!
The responsibility for the regiment.

291
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,530
And you Coby?

292
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,840
You do not want?

293
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,970
I want it!

294
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,360
Then stop jacasser and attack me!

295
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,990
Not yet!

296
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,990
Yes!

297
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,510
Insufficient!

298
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,190
Not yet…

299
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,080
We did not die yet.

300
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,020
Then you want to die at this point?

301
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,490
Now that we chose to become Navy,

302
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,080
if we die while testing, it is because we will have wanted it.

303
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,910
We will not give up now!

304
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,660
I am somebody who will become a Naval officer!

305
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,880
A Naval officer?

306
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,500
It is the funniest thing which I heard of the day!

307
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,510
Here, I am known for many things.

308
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,450
All people have something to say on my subject.

309
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,660
Since I brought you here, I made you work hard.

310
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,300
Today, I checked your true motivations.

311
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,660
Our true motivations?

312
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,000
Physically, I can see how much it was difficult for you.

313
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,990
But your mental is still too weak.

314
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,420
I checked your real motivations to see what hid behind.

315
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,190
Then, one was how?

316
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,850
I would recommend to you for your courage but

317
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,410
you are not yet ready to arrive there!

318
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,130
Forget the forts or the weak ones, you are not even that!

319
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,640
From now, you will involve yourselves even hard.

320
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,650
You prepare!

321
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,380
I will pass on “your friend”…

322
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,360
But mention its name never again.

323
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,290
Cherish right its memory.

324
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,940
Yes! Thank you very much, Garp vice-admiral!

325
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,250
Well! Allons-y!

326
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,540
Towards Little Garden…

327
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,210
Ouais…

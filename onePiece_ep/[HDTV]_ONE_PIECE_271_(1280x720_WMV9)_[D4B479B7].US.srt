1
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Don't Stop! 
Raise the Signal Fire of a Counterattack!

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,040
One Piece Treasure Present! The first keyword is... this!

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,490
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,120
Sogeking who was left behind alone at the Main Island Front Gate

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,880
was told the shocking truth by the giant gatekeeper.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,220
Someday, on a certain island, our two bosses started fighting.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,160
That they've been imprisoned for fifty years is a big lie!

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,660
On the other side, the Straw Hat crew were riding on the back of the Kingbulls, pursuing Luffy.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,770
Just as they finally began to see the Courthouse...

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,420
Damn, Kingbull!

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,830
Sodom!

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,670
Sodom, hang on! Don't fall yet!

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,950
Guys, hurry over to this side! Don't just stand there!

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,110
He's collapsing!

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,610
Facing each other on the roof of the Courthouse, stood Luffy and Blueno.

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,150
Robin is in that building behind you, right?

17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,410
Move out of the way, cow!

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,630
It seems like you and the others still haven't noticed it,

19
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,090
that what you're doing is a great offense against the whole world.

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,430
We'll make all of you criminals wanted throughout the world before making you suffer cruel deaths.

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,700
What?

22
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,850
When I fought this man in the mansion, I'm sure he didn't have such power!

23
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,830
We only came here to take Robin back!

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,810
After a long wait, the expected battle with the CP9 has finally started!

25
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:36,920
This is...

26
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,400
Those guys are really overdoing it.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,940
Baa-chan! Baa-chan!

28
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,490
What is it, Chimney?

29
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,290
You know, you know!

30
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,250
They're here! Aim well!

31
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,450
We have to slow them down!

32
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,750
It's a mortar!

33
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,130
Dodge it, Gomorrah!

34
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,330
This central road was a bad idea! They had organized to ambush us!

35
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,810
We're changing direction!

36
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,220
We won't let you go!

37
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,280
Sodom.

38
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,830
Wait!

39
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,950
Chopper...

40
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,840
Ah? The baby Den-Den Mushi?

41
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,110
Yes, who is it?

42
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,520
It's us.

43
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,700
It's Kokoro baa-san!

44
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,820
What do you want?

45
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,940
Looks like you're still alive. Where are you now?

46
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,060
We're approaching the Courthouse.

47
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,320
Why do you ask?

48
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,250
That's just perfect. There's something I forgot to tell you.

49
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,860
Something you forgot to tell us?

50
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,810
You must be busy now, so I'll tell you already. Listen well.

51
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,730
On Paulie's map, there wasn't any road from the Courthouse to the Judiciary Tower, right?

52
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,410
That's right, it's been bothering me.

53
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,270
Look at the Courthouse, there is a tower on either side.

54
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,620
Yeah, there is.

55
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,990
In both the left and right tower,

56
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,730
at the top floor of each one of them, you should find a lever.

57
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,820
If you pull those, a drawbridge should lower between the Courthouse and the Judiciary Tower.

58
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,020
Baa-san! Why do you know about this?

59
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,180
A long time ago, I was here with Tom-san repairing the bridge.

60
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,920
That stupid ungrateful government!

61
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,650
Don't pass your anger onto me.

62
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,460
And Chimney wants to talk too.

63
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,240
Hello! Pirate neechan, can you hear me?

64
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,080
Wah! What is it, Chimney?

65
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,770
You know, I saw the rubber pirate niichan on the Courthouse's roof.

66
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,360
For real? Luffy is there?

67
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,640
And then, I also saw rocks crumbling on the roof, so it seems like they're getting kinda wild!

68
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,950
On the roof. Understood, thanks!

69
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,550
Pirate girl, don't hang up the Den-Den Mushi yet.

70
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,730
We'll be able to know the situation from where we are.

71
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,980
Roger! That's it.

72
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,470
With this, our goal is decided!

73
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,880
Alright, you guys head directly towards the Courthouse and unite with Straw Hat-san!

74
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,940
Understood.

75
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,030
We'll split into two groups and lower that drawbridge!

76
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,630
We'll leave this to you Gomorrah! Get us to the Courthouse!

77
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,510
Gomorrah!

78
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,820
Shit! Who the hell is he?

79
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,910
It won't go that well.

80
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,930
Pieces of trash.

81
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,080
We did it!

82
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
We beat the second one!

83
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,830
Those pirates have lost their legs now!

84
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,650
Surround them and stop them!

85
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,130
To all of Enies Lobby's military personnel!

86
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,460
At the center of the southeast block, D block, we have stopped the pirate's Kingbulls!

87
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,270
All hands converge towards that place, and completely encircle the D Block!

88
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,620
I repeat! All military personnel, completely encircle the D Block!

89
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,680
Seems like the Jurymen have finally started moving.

90
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,120
There's no one who can oppose them!

91
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,810
Say something!

92
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,220
We absolutely will capture them!

93
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,540
The soldiers we passed by are catching up. This is bad.

94
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,390
There are a lot coming from the front and from the sides!

95
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,960
They're aiming mortar cannons at us too!

96
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,780
This is terrible! There are thousands of them!

97
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,520
If we get surrounded in a place like this, we'll be done for!

98
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,730
What? Is this an earthquake?

99
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,910
Oh, they are...

100
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,740
Awesome!

101
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,990
Oh, look there!

102
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,040
Yatta!

103
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,700
Oimo and Kaashii are back on their feet!

104
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,990
How can this be?

105
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,090
I don't have enough stamina left to fight those guys...

106
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,390
So is this the end!?

107
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,980
Hurry and crush them! Do something about those three, giants!

108
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,590
Go, Kaashii!

109
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,540
Beat them down, Oimo!

110
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,110
Now! Trample these three! Giants!

111
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,360
How could you...

112
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,010
Dare to...

113
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,040
CHEAT US!?

114
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,740
What!? Have those two turned against us!?

115
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,940
Before we celebrate the safety of our bosses!

116
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,710
Before we mourn the wasted time!

117
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,980
Until we're satisfied, we will rampage everything as our anger instructs us to!

118
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,110
Let's go together, King of the Snipers!

119
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,880
There's nothing to fear. This time, we'll raise the signal of a counterattack!

120
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,380
Let's hurry to our comrades!

121
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,970
You're one hell of a lucky woman.

122
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,020
They don't come to save you normally.

123
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,520
Shut your mouth!

124
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,470
Understood!!

125
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,290
No! I'm not particularly sulking because my men aren't coming at all!

126
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,290
Ah, wait guys.

127
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,820
I forgot, take these with you.

128
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,240
Wait! Isn't that a Devil Fruit!?

129
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,690
Yoyoi! Is this...

130
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,680
...the real thing?

131
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,260
Chapapa...

132
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,180
This is the first time I've seen one!

133
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,550
Me too!

134
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,800
This is bad! Don't come any closer to me with that!

135
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,380
What are you making such a fuss about, Jyabura?

136
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,240
Idiot! Don't you know?

137
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,460
The fruits users have a demon dwelling within their bodies!

138
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,790
For example...

139
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,810
If I approach a fruit, the demon inside the fruit will fly out!

140
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,430
It will then start fighting with the demon inside my body!

141
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,940
And my body will explode!

142
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,040
Is that true?

143
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,240
Such foolish words...

144
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,960
We can't have one of our members fall for such a common rumor.

145
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,910
The conditions for the transfer of abilities,

146
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,400
have already been uncovered by Grand Line scientists.

147
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,080
What you're talking about would only happen in the case that one tastes a Devil Fruit twice.

148
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,700
His body would scatter around, leaving no trace, and he'd die.

149
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,200
A greedy fool would destroy himself.

150
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,060
If you think about the risk you take with just one fruit,

151
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,030
you can predict what kind of curse a second one would bring upon yourself.

152
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,500
Eh? So that's how it is?

153
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,540
But, Chief, you've done well on obtaining two Devil Fruits.

154
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,910
Where did you get them?

155
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,630
I've got a lot of connections.

156
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,700
Eat them for next time.

157
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,080
Become even stronger, CP9!

158
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,690
But I'll have to warn you on something.

159
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,660
I don't know what kind of demons are dwelling in these.

160
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,480
These don't look like fruits from this world.

161
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,650
I feel an eerie force, like a gravitational field, coming from it.

162
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,350
It wasn't in my picture book either.

163
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,780
That's normal.

164
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,160
We can figure out the name of the fruit from the abilities we gain.

165
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,460
But what kind of skills we'll get is a gamble.

166
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,510
If we get weird abilities from that gamble, it could lead to the worst life possible.

167
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,050
Furthermore, we'll become hammers in water.

168
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,450
Whatever abilities you get, it's up to you how you use them.

169
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,260
You shouldn't get any weaker from eating it.

170
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,430
Becoming a hammer isn't that bad either.

171
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:58,580
There are tens of thousands of sailors who would die searching for just one of those Devil Fruits.

172
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,860
Try eating it, it's interesting.

173
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,120
Kalifa, don't do it! It's not a good thing.

174
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
It tastes like shit! Like shit!

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,550
Jyabura doesn't want Kaku and her to power up, chapapa.

176
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,190
That's right!

177
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,440
Jealousy and envy are what wound the name of a man!

178
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,280
Yoyoi!

179
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Shut up, won't you!?

180
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,130
Oi, you two. Think about it well!

181
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,290
If it goes well, you could make hundreds of millions from it!

182
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,180
While one mouthful of it could mean a life of problems!

183
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,550
Chapapa...

184
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,010
Hmm, isn't this interesting?

185
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,250
If it's a good one, I'll gladly accept it.

186
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
They ate them! Shit!

187
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,490
Chapapa...

188
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,810
What's wrong!?

189
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:23,110
Yoyoi! Do you feel any changes in your body?

190
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,850
Cha-pa-pa!

191
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,090
It tastes bad.

192
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,330
SAY SO SOONER!!

193
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,480
An awful taste!

194
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,100
You knew about it, chapapa!

195
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,050
Aren't you courageous to have eaten it all?

196
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,450
Oi, try doing something. What kind of power did you get?

197
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,210
I don't feel as if anything has changed.

198
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,670
You'll realize the extent of the changes very soon.

199
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,790
This is the birth of new Devil Fruit users.

200
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,300
This is gonna be fun.

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,740
At least try to control your abilities while you can.

202
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,370
You may have to test them out in actual combat, depending on chief-dono's orders.

203
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,100
Blueno couldn't wait anymore.

204
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,340
Seems like he went ahead to participate in the little feast.

205
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,740
I underestimated you.

206
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,530
You shouldn't!

207
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,640
I didn't think he could keep up with soru's speed...

208
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,370
I'll charge at him with everything.

209
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,890
Direct hits will be useless on a rubber man.

210
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,950
There was a door in the floor just now!

211
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,000
W-What? What's this?

212
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,040
Were there such small doors here before!?

213
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,980
Ah, damn! I'm stuck, shit!

214
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,920
What a trap!

215
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,170
You! What is this, what did you do!? Is this a Devil Fruit!?

216
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,730
I ate the doa doa fruit, I'm a door man.

217
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,960
Door man?

218
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,070
I can turn everything I touch...

219
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,560
Into a door!

220
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,040
What's happening!? My eyes are turning!!

221
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,870
Which way is the front!? Make it stop!

222
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,490
Oi, cook!

223
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,810
Yeah, I saw.

224
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,390
Luffy is already fighting with the CP9.

225
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,900
I-Is that true? Damn, we were too late!

226
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,170
But we're completly surrounded, how are we gonna get out of this?

227
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,820
Because of some guy's steel ball, Gomorrah can't move anymore!

228
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,850
Fire!

229
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,110
Shoot down all the pirates from the monster!

230
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,960
There's only one way remaining!

231
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,640
Yeah, we're gonna have to go through them to the Courthouse!

232
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,680
We can't do otherwise.

233
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,460
Alright! Let's go, guys!

234
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,340
Wait!!

235
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,620
Don't get off, everybody!!

236
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,060
Chopper?

237
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,690
Hold on tight!!

238
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,660
Gomorrah is...

239
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,530
Gomorrah is saying this!

240
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,730
Th-That monster!

241
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,330
It's still alive!

242
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,940
Fire! We have to stop it with mortars!

243
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,310
Fire!

244
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,180
Fight back, we have to cover Gomorrah!

245
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,050
GO, GOMORRAH!

246
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,700
The damage report over there is exceeding two thousand!

247
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,030
This is the worse situation since the formation of Enies Lobby!

248
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,230
Next time, One Piece: Luffy is in Sight!
Gather at the Courthouse Plaza!

249
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,030
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

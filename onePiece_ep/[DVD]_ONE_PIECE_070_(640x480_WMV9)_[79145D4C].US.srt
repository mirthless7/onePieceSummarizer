1
00:01:51,310 --> 00:02:00,360
The Prehistoric island!

2
00:01:51,310 --> 00:02:00,360
Shade hidden on Little Garden!

3
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,540
I wonder whether it will snow.

4
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,000
But it is impossible that it snows!

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,170
Of course how it is possible!

6
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,050
You stays deadened you cannot thus know.

7
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,720
He. It reneiger, isn't this goes?

8
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,960
Eh well nothing is sure, but

9
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,250
this first part of the ocean is single.

10
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,190
The 7 magnetic fields emanating of Mountain Reverse affect all in the sector.

11
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,690
Then we must remain vigilant.

12
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,740
It is rather rare to have a voyage as violent as at the beginning.

13
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,830
But this sea is more difficult to sail than any other in the world.

14
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,330
The gold rule is never not to take this sea with the light one.

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,660
He, sailors!

16
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,630
Loans for a round of my Special Drink?

17
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,050
Dry bottom!

18
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,390
He Usopp, manufactures to us fishing tackle!

19
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,600
Fishing tackle? What a good idea!

20
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,730
Well!

21
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,150
I will make soft foods of fishing really not very ordinary!

22
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,690
Not, not.
Not like that…

23
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,030
You like that?

24
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,070
Delicious, not true?

25
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,450
Incredible!

26
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,750
In bottom, Karu!

27
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,290
Cool! Cool Méga!

28
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,370
How can they act of the kind?

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,540
Here is the tien.

30
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,960
Go! Go! Go!

31
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,680
Let do them.

32
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,330
If a storm approaches, they can what make.

33
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,400
They do not want to die, you know.

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,860
Eh well, I suppose it,

35
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,060
but they are not even with the aguets!

36
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,360
You should not be also anxious.

37
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,830
Not on this boat.

38
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,110
Aglou! Aglou! Aglou!

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,160
What a idiot, this Karu!

40
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,140
Eh well, it is enough releasing…

41
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
He the guy, look at!

42
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,160
It is a dolphin!

43
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,170
It is nice!

44
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,030
GIGANTIC!

45
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,670
It LEFT!

46
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,260
Allons-y!

47
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,880
Ouais!

48
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,210
Well!

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,750
Ensure this line!

50
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,430
Let make me!

51
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,160
These guy…

52
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,860
FULL SAIL!

53
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,070
Perfect! One tankard the wave and one draws from here!

54
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,830
Nami! How is the course?

55
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,360
Wait one moment, I check.

56
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,180
Turn the rudder of all your forces!

57
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,510
With your orders!

58
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,110
No the doubt.

59
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,530
One is aligned perfectly.

60
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,220
Our next destination is…

61
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,310
this island!

62
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,590
Then here it is,

63
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,750
the second island of Large Line!

64
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,890
Mr. 3…

65
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,530
What is there?
Wait one second.

66
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,470
All the other teas really insipid are compared with Earl Grey.

67
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,400
I am bored.

68
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,630
You do not stop saying that you are bored, but you also hate to work.

69
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,210
As long as orders were not received,

70
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,210
as much to release themselves and benefit from it, not truth?

71
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,330
To have pleasant holidays like that

72
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,210
fact part of the privileges of an Agent Officer.

73
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,760
And still a thing…

74
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,500
Stop using my code name as a public.

75
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,760
People will finish by knowing that I am Mr. 3.

76
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,230
Really?

77
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,280
And by the way, during these last days you did not do anything of other but to look at this foutu paper.

78
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,190
What can that be well?

79
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,990
Orders of the chief.

80
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,450
WHY DIDN'T SAY It EARLIER to YOU?

81
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,050
Then Mr. 5 was beaten…

82
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,480
If that had been Mr. 2, I would have been happier.

83
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,120
Thus one would have been promoted.

84
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,570
The defeat of Mr. 5 is not astonishing.

85
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,520
This man was a cretin who believed too much in the superiority of his capacities.

86
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,190
There is nothing more useless than a man having the capacities Demon

87
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,330
but which is not enough malignant to use them effectively.

88
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,440
A professional criminal uses his remarkable intelligence to arrive at his ends.

89
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,540
Perhaps that one could teach them something,

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,860
as what they is to put at back the largest criminal organization.

91
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,870
Then here Little Garden.

92
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,130
It is not “little” whole good blood!

93
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,970
It is definitely less nice than the name…

94
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,090
An unexplored territory would be said…

95
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
A jungle in a wild state!

96
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
One will have to pay attention.

97
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,120
I still think so that Miss All Sunday said.

98
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,990
But your bad luck comes

99
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,980
road where the Log Poses leads you.

100
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,560
The name of the next island is…

101
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,100
Little Garden.

102
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,180
My expensive, even if one does nothing to stop you, you will never arrive at Arabasta.

103
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,460
You all will be destroyed.

104
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,770
Does C-C-Ca mean that there will be monsters?

105
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,580
Who knows?

106
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,560
Let us pass to the following island without making stopover here!

107
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,180
But there is need of time to regulate the Log.

108
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,310
Y' has that, and it is as high time as we make some provisions.

109
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,700
One did not succeed in supplying us at the last city.

110
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,420
I see a river mouth in front right!

111
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,780
Really?

112
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,740
Yakiniku = Korean Barbecue.

113
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,870
I hope that there will be a Yakiniku restaurant!

114
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,000
Would there why be here a good blood of it?

115
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,880
You ace not known as which one did have need for provisions?

116
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,130
I wanted to say that one needed ingredients!!

117
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,630
You ace really that a chick-pea in the head!

118
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,700
But to make stopover is dangerous.

119
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,130
I want to say, look at these plants.

120
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,810
They are not on any book of botany which I read.

121
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,110
How it is nice!

122
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,810
Who me?

123
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,030
NAMI-SAN, OF COURSE!!

124
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,850
What is it?

125
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,270
Do not worry you.

126
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,610
It is surely a p' tit bird.

127
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,640
And it is right a normal jungle.
Y' has anything worrying.

128
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:21,940
What is there?

129
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,620
NAME OF GOD, DIRTINESS Of BIRD!!

130
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,110
A lizard?

131
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,550
I ask for myself which taste that A.

132
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,960
It is that the kind of noise which one hears in a normal jungle?

133
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,690
Ca resembles an volcanic eruption!

134
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,350
A tiger?

135
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,590
It is monstrous!!

136
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:27,970
What?

137
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,510
What did it arrive to him?

138
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,370
It is not normal.

139
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,680
It is at all normal!

140
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,440
How a tiger, the king of the jungle, can bathe in its own blood?

141
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,510
Good then, it is decided, we will not make a stopover on this island!

142
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,320
We just will have patience on the boat and will wait calmly until the Log is ready.

143
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,050
Yes!

144
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,330
Then one puts the veils from here as quickly as possible.

145
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,720
Yes!!

146
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,530
One must hurry to arrive at Arabasta, not true?

147
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,740
Bento = Box of Japanese meal

148
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,120
Sanji, a bento!

149
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,510
A bento?

150
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,850
Yes, to hold me in form!

151
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,990
A ton of meat and without crudenesses!

152
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,370
A bento of pirate!

153
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,430
Ca feels the adventure with full nose!

154
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,390
He you, wait one minute!

155
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,660
Where do you believe to leave like that?

156
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,670
With the adventure!

157
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,170
You want to come?

158
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,540
The adventure! The adventure!

159
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,160
It is useless… I cannot stop it.

160
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,550
It is too excited.

161
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,720
You laugh, not true?

162
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,320
The monster which killed this enormous tiger is always in nature!

163
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,340
Sanji, a bento!

164
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,990
I heard you.

165
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,470
Give me one minute.

166
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,360
He, that done anything if I do leave with you?

167
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,760
Not, not of problem! Allons-y!

168
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,870
Do not say to me that you will go with him?

169
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,780
Eh well, if I remain here sitted, I will finish by me making pimpernel.

170
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,340
I will be quieter thus while it is waited until the Log is ready.

171
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,640
You cannot!
Luffy does that all the time,

172
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,790
but for you they is very dangerous!

173
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,940
The adventure! The adventure!

174
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,830
All will be well!
Karu will be with me!

175
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,600
It is so surprised that it lost the voice of them.

176
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,980
Well, Vivi-Chan, I will prepare you a special bento made with love!

177
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,780
Can you also put some cocktails for Karu, please?

178
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,260
Of course!

179
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,970
Let make me!

180
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,230
Well!

181
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,830
A bento of pirate and a special cocktail for Karu!

182
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,370
You are ready?

183
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,120
Ouaip!

184
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,300
Well, one left!

185
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,360
Perfect!
On the way!!!

186
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,050
We will be soon of return!

187
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,260
It has tripe…

188
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,580
Wednesday miss.

189
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,520
You expected what of other of somebody who infiltrated an criminal organization?

190
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,940
Good, I have time to kill.
I will make a turn.

191
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,360
A TURN?

192
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,310
He, Zoro!

193
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,980
Wait!

194
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,200
One is with course of puffs out.

195
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,340
If you see something of edible, brings back it.

196
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,610
Ok, I included/understood.

197
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,070
I will drive out something which you will be unable to catch all alone.

198
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,180
Await Zoro!!!

199
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,720
I heard what you said.

200
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,850
Bastard, you believe that you can bring back something of larger than I will be able it?

201
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,190
In the thousand.

202
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,050
A contest of hunting.

203
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,930
Listen. Gaining will be that which will have brought back the most kilos of meat.

204
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,560
You want to say tons?

205
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,430
You will make less the boasting one when our preys are aligned.

206
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,050
I think the same thing.

207
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,420
They all are similar.

208
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,910
Why do they all have to follow the same way?

209
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,460
I include/understand exactly what you feel.

210
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,020
Do not cry, I am on your side.

211
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,690
They gave up us…

212
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,350
It is what I was going to say!

213
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,540
But, wait one minute…

214
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,270
Q… What is there?

215
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,510
N- N N Nami?

216
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,340
It is not that one…

217
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,960
That one, either.

218
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,950
He! He, He! Nami? Nami!

219
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,460
What do you seek good blood?

220
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,680
I remember to have read it in one of these books.

221
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,280
What?

222
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,710
Little Garden.

223
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,170
What is there?

224
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,780
He, looks at! You see this trick?

225
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,650
One would say a squid with a shell.

226
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,010
A squid shell.

227
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,600
An ammonite would be said.

228
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,020
It is a squid shell.

229
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,070
I have the impression that one observes me.

230
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,030
Ca must be my imagination.

231
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,480
Do Oh, you want to play with me, filth?

232
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,370
It is what this thing?

233
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,090
Is Ca eaten?

234
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,300
Let us see seeing… It was which?

235
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,710
I read it recently.

236
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,940
What did I make some?

237
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,330
Why does y' have a king of the seas who walks on ground?

238
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,820
A DINOSAUR!!

239
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,110
A DINOSAUR?

240
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,570
Then… that must be one of the prehistoric islands!

241
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,040
This island remained still with Old Dinosaurs!

242
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,510
Because of the difficulty of navigation of the islands of Large Line,

243
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,810
diversities of the islands seldom mix the ones with the others.

244
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
Each island thus developed its ecosystem which is clean for him.

245
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,430
Therefore, there are islands which contain civilizations which are more advanced,

246
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,390
and there are islands which remained isolated during tens of thousands of years,

247
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,650
and which kept their original state!

248
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,120
The unforeseeable climates of Large Line make this possible!

249
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,950
This island really remained with Old of the Dinosaurs!

250
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,330
INCREDIBLE!

251
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,160
Luffy!

252
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,480
DO NOT GO UP ON TOP!

253
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,200
Usopp!

254
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,310
Usopp!

255
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,740
What? What is there?

256
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,920
You found the book?

257
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,100
Be tough large bastard for you.

258
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Santouryuu = Style of combat with 3 swords

259
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,200
A follower of the Santouryuu combat?

260
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,180
It is terrible! This island is…

261
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Is this island?

262
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,050
What?

263
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,300
I believed to intend Nami-San to call me…

264
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,230
For the inhabitants who live here,

265
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,870
the island is like a small garden.

266
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Little Garden…

267
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,650
It is as that which one calls this place.

268
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,170
Chief of forwarding, Louis Arnote.

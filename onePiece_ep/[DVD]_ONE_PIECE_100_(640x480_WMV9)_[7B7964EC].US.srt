1
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:30,040
Kohza, the warrior rebels!

2
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:30,040
The made promise with vivi!

3
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,150
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,850
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,200
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,300
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,900
Having left the green city of Erumalu, Luffy and its crew…

8
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,070
… move towards the oasis of Yuba, where the rebels are.

9
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,620
He, stops that!

10
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,580
Look at all that you reversed!

11
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,410
It is really waste.

12
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,180
One will not make a cheese of it!

13
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,680
Ace gave us an entirely full barrel.

14
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,520
You thus do not have any direction of reserve?!

15
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,550
You are lagging behind since the beginning.

16
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,590
He also will drink a little water.

17
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,000
I kept of it side for when Nami-San says,

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,640
“Ah, I die of thirst…! ”, and at this moment…

19
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,000
I will have it at disposal for him to give some immediately!

20
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,450
NAMI-SAN! VIVI-CHAN!

21
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,940
You want a little water?

22
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,180
Imbecile! It is me which will drink!

23
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,770
Not, that will go.

24
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,140
Give the-me!

25
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,570
Moron!

26
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,190
Release me!

27
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,080
Give!

28
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,960
You reverse all!

29
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,830
Why I cannot have some a little?
There is so much!

30
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,240
Species of jerk! What you insane, Luffy?!

31
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,350
Good blood, what do you believe that you make, there?

32
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,650
You want to drink a blow?

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,680
It is what your problem?!

34
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,360
Drop! It is not right for these young ladies!

35
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,680
Thank you. But that goes.

36
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,850
What takes to you?!

37
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,730
Be to you a dumb, Luffy!

38
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,980
You already drank some!

39
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,420
Dumb, you are all wasting!

40
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,010
Say, Vivi?

41
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,040
You would like to say some to me more well on the rebellious army?

42
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,390
Yes, you have reason, it is better than I learn some to you more on them.

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,020
RELEASE me!

44
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,360
It was 11 years ago…

45
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,660
Vivi. You…

46
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,470
… will be a large Princess!

47
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,610
Our village…

48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,500
Our village suffers from the dryness.

49
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,230
Why are not you not come to save it?!

50
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,430
The climate is a thing that only God controls.

51
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,010
I am perhaps the King, but there is not only I can make against the forces of nature.

52
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,810
But my father said to me that the King could all achieve!

53
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,150
I can just make my better with the means which are given to me.

54
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,900
Your size!

55
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,950
The father of this boy penetrated in the palate.

56
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,070
What a audacity!

57
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,180
Your Majesty, it is with me to assume stupidities of my son!

58
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,680
I am ready to humbly accept any punishment which you will consider necessary!

59
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,710
I beg you!

60
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,490
I do not manage to believe only this… idiotic!

61
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,260
This imbecile…

62
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,310
This imbecile…

63
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,500
This imbecile…

64
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,710
This imbecile…

65
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,070
This imbecile!

66
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,790
You Toto, isn't this is called?

67
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,100
Yes!

68
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,330
Until new order, the country will provide for the needs for the villagers touched by the dryness.

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,310
You will remain here, in Alubarna to think of your future.

70
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,540
What a kindness!

71
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,050
I thank you!

72
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,940
Thank you with you!!

73
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,280
But whore?!

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,270
You do not include/understand at all what the villagers can feel!

75
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,440
Remain there, Kohza!

76
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,360
Return immediately!

77
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,150
Louse.

78
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,280
Yes!

79
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,350
It is a good boy.

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,320
He spoke about what the villagers felt!

81
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,040
It was for their although it came here.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
What do you have, pleurnichard?

83
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,750
Do Tain' what you want me small?

84
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,960
Small?

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,170
Cobra-Sama.

86
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,200
What is there, Igaram?

87
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,420
Can I say a word…

88
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,950
I am afraid that there are not enough means in the budget of the country to provide the needs of all these villagers.

89
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,380
IMBECILE!

90
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,680
Then take in our own funds!

91
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,760
No matter what we can make, one will arrive there!

92
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,300
Included/understood. As you will want.

93
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,870
It is terrible!

94
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,010
Your Majesty!

95
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,200
Vivi-Sama is…!

96
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,530
I fought.

97
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,520
But I lost.

98
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,620
VIVI!

99
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,830
VIVI-SAMA!

100
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,610
This species of small snotty-nosed kid!

101
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,330
How did he dare to make such a thing with the Princess of our nation!?

102
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,440
I will give him a lesson!

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,570
Wait, wait! Igaram!

104
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,150
I will give him a good lesson!

105
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,270
I am really sorry!

106
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,670
Let give me my life as an excuse!

107
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,090
STOP THIS DIN, BANDAGES SIMPLETONS!

108
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,540
Imbeciles! It is not that a brawl of children!

109
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,870
Hello and welcome!

110
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,940
Welcome! Welcome!

111
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,590
They is cheap! It is not expensive!

112
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,440
They is really good! Go, come to buy!

113
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,780
There is a brawl!

114
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,350
Welcome!

115
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,360
You dispatch!

116
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,680
Do not retain yourself because it is the Princess!

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,570
She looks us top!
Put to him a beating!

118
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,380
VIVI-CHAN! VAS-YYYY!

119
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,400
He you two!
Our leader, it is Kohza!

120
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,530
If I gain, I will become your leader.

121
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,070
I will not lose vis-a-vis somebody like you, small!

122
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,120
I was always the leader of this clan!

123
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,080
I arrive!

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,880
Listen, all!

125
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,190
From today, Vivi are the assistant manager of the Sandy one!

126
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,900
Objections?

127
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,230
NONE!

128
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,010
Look at, Igaram.

129
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,030
Vivi was made friends.

130
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,460
Yes.

131
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,080
If this girl is led one day to direct Arabasta,

132
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,330
it is the most important thing for it.

133
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,080
Louse-Ojisan, Obasan! Hello!

134
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,280
Where is the leader?

135
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,950
He, hello you.

136
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,440
If you seek Kohza, it already left.

137
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,330
It is surely at the usual place.

138
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,790
From agreement, I go there!

139
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,720
Oh, Vivi-Chan!
What do you make for the lunch?

140
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,780
I will eat with you! With presently!

141
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,130
It is really a strange country.

142
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,480
The Princess of all the kingdom comes in a poor farm like ours.

143
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,440
It is sign which peace reigns.

144
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,880
Igaram-San, would you like to join us for the lunch?

145
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,520
Not, not, that will go.

146
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,720
I have onigiri prepared with me.

147
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,830
Excuse me!

148
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,250
Co Cobra-Sama!

149
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,780
Good blood but what…?!

150
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,990
Your Majesty!

151
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,030
You still followed me?!

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,760
M- But…

153
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,610
I worry for Vivi-Chan…

154
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,100
Return immediately! You want that my concerns are double?!

155
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,970
HOW?!

156
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,450
There is not “how” which counts!

157
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,440
It was a good country.

158
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:27,810
Yes.

159
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,040
He! Coward water!

160
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,640
Not question!

161
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,760
But…

162
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,250
… much things did without.

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,940
He you, small.

164
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,700
You go some share?

165
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,860
You want company?

166
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,020
Sandy! With the attack!

167
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,790
YES!

168
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,970
Who are these kids?!
One did not deal with them or what?!

169
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,090
Leader… Everyone…

170
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,440
Vivi! Run away yourself!

171
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,400
It is with you that they want some!

172
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,560
Hurry to flee, Vivi!

173
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,790
They will kill you!

174
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,730
But… Leader…!

175
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,730
One will not kill it.

176
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,300
One just will kidnap it to ask for a ransom, you see?

177
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,600
Shit!

178
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,720
Go, come without resisting, Princesse Vivi…

179
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,080
You believe that I will leave it to you?

180
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,520
The Sandy ones will protect it until death!

181
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,120
YES!

182
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,770
Wow? What is it?

183
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,950
It is what this trick?

184
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,320
It is what?

185
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,020
IT IS ENORMOUS!

186
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,490
Super!

187
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,630
He, tells me the remainder of the history!

188
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,940
Of agreement. The leader, Kohza, were a boy with enormously of bravery.

189
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,550
But it is this great bravery which worried me.

190
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,440
You believe that I will leave it to you?

191
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,570
The Sandy ones will protect it until death!

192
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,290
You were really not on your guards.

193
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,840
There was another guy?!

194
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,750
Shit, it flees!

195
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,620
It moves straight towards the ruins.

196
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,660
One will catch up with it.

197
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,590
Do not let them pass!

198
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,920
YES!

199
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,010
Species of large dumbs!

200
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,840
But what that means?!

201
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,510
He!

202
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,170
What arrived to you?

203
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,870
Who did that to you?

204
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,440
There are brigands who are after Vivi!

205
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,470
HOW?

206
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,520
A brigand with a knife!
They went to the ruins!

207
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,610
Kohza was put at their continuation…!

208
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,980
What?

209
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,850
Princess!

210
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,430
Where do you hide?

211
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,130
Where are you Princesse?

212
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,940
Good blood but where is it hiding place?

213
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,010
Let us find it and this time let us not let it escape.

214
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,440
Princess Vivi, you show!

215
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,130
Oh, then it is there that you were hidden.

216
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,660
Render to me service while delivering to you without resisting.

217
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,060
WAIT!

218
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,050
Leader!

219
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,280
You do not have anything, Vivi?

220
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,910
Shit, that hurt!

221
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,560
Do not mistake the Sandy ones, brigand!

222
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,830
You may find it beneficial to release from our village!

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,010
He, kid.

224
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,090
Close it and delivers to me the Princess.

225
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,630
You should not attract you the anger of an adult.

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,750
A knife!

227
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,570
Course, leader!

228
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,870
It is not your wood end which will frighten me!

229
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,440
The Sandy ones will protect it until death!

230
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,770
Leader please, stops!

231
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,780
You really want in découdre, hein?

232
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,140
Leader!

233
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,610
He, how did you dare tabasser Aniki of the kind?

234
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,610
Aniki is employed here in the direction of “brother”.

235
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,600
It was not really a thing to be made!

236
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,400
They are taken both?

237
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
Now, come by there.

238
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,070
TAKE THAT!

239
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,970
Stunned poor wretches!

240
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,220
Dad!

241
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,640
Igaram!

242
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,920
Vivi-Sama! Es you wounded?

243
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,200
Bastard, that you made with my daughter?!

244
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,580
Species of refuse!

245
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,550
Insolate!

246
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:29,980
Insolate!

247
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,320
Insolate!

248
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,610
Insolate!

249
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,130
Insolate!

250
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,850
Insolate…!

251
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,950
It would seem that these guy also form part of their band.

252
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,670
Insolate!

253
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,150
Chaka!

254
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,070
Pell!

255
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,320
What you made there?

256
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,770
“What you made there?”

257
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,590
It is what one would like to know.

258
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,600
Why the king is out of the Palate and that one finds it fighting kind by here?

259
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,520
Please abstain from this kind of heroic behavior.

260
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,370
Igaram!

261
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
Kohza is…

262
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,800
Yes, we must bring it to a doctor!

263
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,440
As well as the members of Sandy who are in a dirty state!

264
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,570
Chaka! Pell! Carry assistance to them!

265
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,080
Yes!

266
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,060
Such a courageous child…

267
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,600
What doesn't go, Vivi?

268
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,790
How long still will you cry?

269
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,450
But…

270
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,050
I had if fear.

271
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,510
Eh well me too.

272
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,400
It had a knife.

273
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,200
That is not that…

274
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:31,310
It is because the Leader said that it would protect me until death…

275
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,240
The Sandy ones will protect it until death!

276
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,280
Say never again that you will die… Leader…

277
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,730
More than anything else, the prospect to lose a friend really frightened him.

278
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,850
Vivi is still a child, but it is the Princess.

279
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,190
Kohza.

280
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,660
Today, you achieved a noble task.

281
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,250
I would like to express my gratitude and to say to you thank you.

282
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,240
Vivi is my friend.

283
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,890
Therefore I did it.

284
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,830
I see.

285
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I am in a hurry to see you taking again the torch with Arabasta in the next years.

286
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,060
Es you attached to this country?

287
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:22,970
Yes.

288
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,620
It is here that I was born.

289
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,590
Eh well me too.

290
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,740
I am…

291
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,840
I am a little anxious.

292
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,810
Why thus?

293
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,070
The leader of a country must make at the same time difficult and severe decisions.

294
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,560
In this respect, Princess Vivi is too nice.

295
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,580
Igaram.

296
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,570
Yes?

297
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,150
All is well.

298
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,830
Arabasta goes better thus.

299
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,400
I will remain on the throne until death separates me.

300
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,700
Yuba?

301
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,240
Yes, it is that!

302
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,520
Your father spoke about it with mine.

303
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,200
Louse-Ojisan?

304
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,140
He entrusted the direction of this uninhabited oasis, Yuba to us, to develop it and transform it downtown!

305
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,240
Many merchants and travellers forward each day there.

306
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,320
It is the center of activities of Western Arabasta!

307
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,500
If we build a city there, will you imagine a little which be the joy of people?

308
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,190
Isn't this brilliant?

309
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,660
And my old father accepted the function of representative of the people!

310
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,260
Do leader, you leave too?

311
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,200
Of course that yes!

312
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,040
Even if my old father asked me to remain here.

313
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,520
I know very well that to build a city will not be an easy task, but I will arrive there!

314
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,010
I will build a new town of my own hands!

315
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,290
Yuba is the kind of city which the country needs!

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
I count on you, Toto.

317
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,330
Yes, your Majesty.

318
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,320
I will build you a splendid city.

319
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,050
Eh well, I say to you with soon, Vivi-Chan.

320
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,580
One will not be re-examined before a short period of time.

321
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,300
When the city takes form, thus come to visit us!

322
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,550
It is of agreement! Louse-Ojisan!

323
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,380
We will build a splendid city which will help the country to thrive!

324
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,070
ON THE WAY!

325
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,210
Later, Vivi. You…

326
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,700
… will be a large Princess!

327
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:40,690
Yes!

328
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,050
Kohza! How can you be also arrogant?!

329
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,280
Kohza rightly.

330
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,660
Yuba surely will help the country to thrive.

331
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,990
In fact, your friend Kohza was a guy well.

332
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,240
But is there an unspecified relationship with the rebellious army?

333
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:05,910
Yes.

334
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,110
You see…

335
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,980
We move towards Yuba, the place where is installed the rebellious army.

336
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,540
And the name of their leader is…

337
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,830
Kohza.

338
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,300
You want to say that…?

339
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,000
It is the same boy that about which I spoke to you.

340
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,540
NAMI-SAN!

341
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,740
Nami-San, would you like to taste some a little?

342
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,600
This shrimp of the desert is really good!

343
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,000
That is not a shrimp! It is a scorpion!

344
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,160
I cannot about it any more, I ate too much!

345
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,340
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT! YOU STOP MAKING THE IDIOTS?!

346
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,580
One advances, now!

347
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,430
What puts it as much in bad temper?

348
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,250
Who knows…

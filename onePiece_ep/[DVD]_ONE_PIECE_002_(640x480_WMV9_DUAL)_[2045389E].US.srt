1
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:57,086
Oh! What a nice day!

2
00:01:57,223 --> 00:02:01,353
Keep going this way! We'll
see the navy base soon.

3
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,826
Koby! You are good!

4
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:05,590
We got here indeed!

5
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:06,732
Sure...

6
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,224
That's the basic skill of a sailor!

7
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:14,396
You're still in a good mood, Luffy.

8
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,771
I heard that he was caught there!

9
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,314
The famous bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro!

10
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,516
A bloody animal! Hunting down pirates!

11
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:32,181
<i>He cuts them into pieces!</i>

12
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:37,324
<i>He's a man, known as "the demon".</i>

13
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:40,435
(Episode 2) "The Great Swordsman!
Bounty Hunter Roronoa Zoro"

14
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:45,661
(Episode 2) "Daikengou Arawaru!
Kaizoku-kari Roronoa Zoro"

15
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:48,612
<i>(Based on Manga ch.3: "Enter Zoro Pirate
Hunter", ch.4: "The Great Captain Morgan"...)</i>

16
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:51,062
<i>(...and ch.5: "The Pirate
King And The Master Swordsman")</i>

17
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:55,511
We are finally here!

18
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,760
Hey Luffy,

19
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:04,179
Don't be stupid enough to see him!

20
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:05,586
I havn't decided yet

21
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:07,283
depends on whether he
is a good guy or not.

22
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:09,614
He is a bad guy! That's
why he was caught!

23
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:18,266
Uh, is Zoro captured at the base?

24
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:26,478
You can't mention that name here!

25
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:30,640
Let's go there first! Don't
you want to join the navy?

26
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:34,014
Um... I'm not quite ready.

27
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:38,852
I heard that there is
a captain named Morgan...

28
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:46,629
People in this town are so funny!

29
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:49,132
The people are scared
hearing the name "Zoro"...

30
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,466
...they are even so scared
hearing the name "Morgan"!

31
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:55,540
I'm not so sure now.

32
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:57,939
Sounds kind of fun.

33
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,326
How can it be?

34
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,248
OK! We're here!

35
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:06,281
We are here!

36
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:09,114
We have to say good-bye, Luffy!

37
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:11,690
In a such short time... Huh?

38
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:12,992
Yes!

39
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:15,325
Luffy! Why are you climbing that wall?

40
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:18,022
Where is the demon?

41
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:22,191
He can't be here! He must be isolated.

42
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,213
Yes! He's there! Alright!

43
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,772
See that guy?

44
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,267
How can it be?

45
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:40,442
Black bandanna... Haramaki sash...

46
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,714
He is Roronoa Zoro!

47
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,349
Very simple! Let's untie
him so he can leave!

48
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,655
Don't be stupid!

49
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,730
How can you let him go?

50
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:54,493
He might kill you!

51
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,172
Don't worry! I'm strong!

52
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,563
No!

53
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,067
Hey, you!

54
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,018
You're in the way...

55
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:07,387
Go away.

56
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,120
Luffy, if you want to have
him join you, you'll die!

57
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,187
It's very dangerous!

58
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,091
Luffy! Stop her! She will be killed!

59
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:29,273
What do you want?

60
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:30,895
You must be hungry...

61
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,053
...so I have some riceballs for you.

62
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,206
Kid! Do you want to die? Get out.

63
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:39,073
Big brother! You haven't eaten anything!

64
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:40,279
Here!

65
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,804
It's my first time.

66
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:44,096
I put my heart into it.

67
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:47,773
I'm not hungry.

68
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,468
I don't like them! Go away!

69
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:50,586
But...

70
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:52,058
I don't want it! I might kill you!

71
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,361
Don't take it so hard...

72
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:02,096
I didn't expect this, Roronoa Zoro.

73
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,578
That's another weird guy!

74
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,002
Wonderful! Must be a naval officer!

75
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,434
That kid will be safe!

76
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:12,576
Hey, it looks good!

77
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,194
Oh no!

78
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,312
Yech! It's sweet!

79
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:19,884
It has sugar!

80
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,699
Riceballs have salt! Salt!

81
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,985
It's good to me with sugar.

82
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,286
Tastes terrible! Completely inedible!

83
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,054
No! No!

84
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:30,628
This is going too far!

85
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:39,569
It took so long to make them...

86
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,966
Oh, didn't you see this notice?

87
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,194
"Anyone who helps
criminals will be hanged."

88
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:50,408
Signed, Captain Morgan.

89
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:55,602
Even a kid should know my daddy.

90
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,477
Daddy?

91
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,850
is he the son of Captain Morgan?

92
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,428
Hey! Throw this kid out!

93
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:07,432
I said throw him out!

94
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,228
Are you deaf?

95
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,859
I'll tell my daddy!

96
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,335
Yes! Right away!

97
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:15,338
No!

98
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,801
Sorry, missy... huddle yourself up.

99
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,577
Thank you.

100
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,238
Are you alright Luffy?

101
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:33,107
Were you hurt?

102
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,724
He's going too far!

103
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,105
Were you hurt?

104
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:38,979
Cretin!

105
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:46,769
I'm not sure that you can make it!

106
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:50,069
Uh... at least one month.

107
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,393
Then do your best!

108
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:56,718
I have ten days left!

109
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,103
I don't think you can make it!

110
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:03,147
He is going too far!

111
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:04,786
Luffy-san?

112
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:06,558
He's gone?

113
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:10,970
I heard that you're a bad egg.

114
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,188
You still here?

115
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,699
I'm looking for a crew member.

116
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,200
Are you really tough?

117
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:18,529
Mind your own business!

118
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,070
I'd be dead if I had
no food for three days!

119
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:26,514
I'm much different than you!

120
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,904
I'll survive!

121
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,184
I must!

122
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,930
Oh, what a weird guy!

123
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:35,897
Wait!

124
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,862
Could you get that?

125
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:44,829
You wanna eat that? It's all dirty.

126
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,650
Just give it to me!

127
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,684
Why didn't you listen?

128
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,941
It's good...

129
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,043
I'm stuffed.

130
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:02,469
Really?

131
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,233
Yes! He ate it all!

132
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,775
I'm so happy!

133
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:11,030
Is he really that bad?

134
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:12,723
Not at all!

135
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:17,570
He was imprisoned because of us.

136
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,419
Oh? What happened?

137
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,568
It was Helmeppo that caused it.

138
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,143
He is the son of Captain Morgan.

139
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:34,113
Move it! Move it! Give my pet some room!

140
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,877
Anyone in the way will be hanged!

141
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,606
Go away!

142
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:48,931
Hey! You really got
some nerve doing that!

143
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:50,448
Rika! Don't!

144
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:52,157
Something bad will happen if you do it!

145
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,379
I don't believe it!

146
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,884
He's dead!

147
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,529
Who are you?

148
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:09,924
Are you the bounty hunter, Roronoa Zoro?

149
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,818
What if I am?

150
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,739
Why would a bounty hunter
cross paths with the navy?

151
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,869
I'm trying to eat my food quietly.

152
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,063
Damn you!

153
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:32,062
You're too noisy...

154
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:35,293
...you... you and your pet.

155
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,674
Don't you know that...

156
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,114
if I tell my dad about this,

157
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:47,053
they will be hanged!

158
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,164
Well? Should we trade?

159
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:57,009
You can take their place and be tied up.

160
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,546
Yeah! For only one month!

161
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:04,463
If you can make it
through, I'll let you live.

162
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,497
Well?

163
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:09,910
Just one month.

164
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,399
Three weeks later...

165
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:21,041
...big brother has been
tortured by Helmeppo!

166
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,822
It's my fault! It's my fault!

167
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:26,538
I see.

168
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:32,627
I'm hungry! Give us free food!

169
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:36,247
Hey! We want some wine here!

170
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,195
Keep it coming! Toute de suite!

171
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,343
That's it! Yes!

172
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:48,337
I'm bored! Let's execute Zoro tomorrow!

173
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,947
I promise you'll have a good show!

174
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,189
What are you doing?

175
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,218
Luffy! Don't!

176
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:04,461
You liar!

177
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:07,632
You dare to do this?

178
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,241
I'm the son of Captain Morgan!

179
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,502
So what?

180
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,292
I'll tell my father and
you'll be executed too!

181
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,590
I dare you!

182
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,484
Luffy! Calm down!

183
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,403
Are you trying to be
the enemy of the navy?

184
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:20,582
I've decided! Koby!

185
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:25,840
I want Zoro to be my companion!

186
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:32,465
I'm the greatest!

187
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:34,670
Yes!

188
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,181
Correct, Captain Morgan!

189
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:41,306
Not many people are
paying tribute to me.

190
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,480
It is that... they no
longer have enough to give.

191
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,863
It's not how they pay, but
it's how much respect they have.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,224
Am I right?

193
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:55,701
Father!

194
00:12:56,472 --> 00:13:00,259
I want you to kill Zoro!

195
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:36,600
You are so useless, Zoro!

196
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:39,808
We had a deal...

197
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,352
I can't die here!

198
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,339
You again? Don't you
have anything to do?

199
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,368
Let me untie you! But
you must work with me!

200
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:02,769
What are you doing?

201
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:05,271
I'm looking for a
companion for a pirate.

202
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:07,636
Dream on!

203
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:09,981
I don't want to be your mate.

204
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,078
Don't waste your time.

205
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:12,952
What's wrong with being a pirate?

206
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:16,117
"Pirate" means "bad guy". Who
want to be a pirate anyway?

207
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,608
What's wrong with that?

208
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:20,552
You're practically a pirate to them!

209
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,181
I don't care what they think!

210
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,352
I've never done a thing
that I'll be sorry.

211
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:29,056
No matter what, I will survive!

212
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:32,067
I'll do what I want to do!

213
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,061
Oh... yeah.

214
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:37,523
I've made my decision.

215
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:38,507
With what?

216
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:40,408
Can you use a sword?

217
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:44,445
The stupid son of the
captain took my swords.

218
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,288
I'll get it back for you. What?

219
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:50,664
If you want it back,
you must work with me!

220
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,021
You're freaking nuts, you know that?

221
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:56,687
... trying to break in
the base by yourself?

222
00:14:57,826 --> 00:15:00,428
it's on the other side, you idiot!

223
00:15:00,837 --> 00:15:01,856
What?

224
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:05,525
GOMU GOMU NO! SPRING HAND!

225
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:09,570
Who is this guy?

226
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:16,122
1,2... 1,2... 1,2...

227
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:20,247
1,2... 1,2...

228
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:21,682
OK! Stop for a minute!

229
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,615
Make it stand up all the way!

230
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:28,368
Hey pop! You owe me a favor!

231
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,116
That kid hit me!

232
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:33,358
You never hit ME in the face!

233
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:37,432
Do you know why I haven't hit you?

234
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,143
Do you know why?

235
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:42,661
I do! I'm your...

236
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:46,205
It's because...

237
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:57,812
...you're so stupid,
you're not worth hitting!

238
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:00,447
Don't get me wrong!

239
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,323
I'm the greatest!

240
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:08,453
I am!

241
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,511
By the way... I've been told
that someone broke onto the base.

242
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:19,179
Yes! I gave her a little lesson...

243
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,215
Was she executed?

244
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:24,711
No she wasn't! She's just a little kid!

245
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:26,714
Hey you!

246
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:28,713
Go into town and kill her!

247
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:32,056
She's only a little girl!

248
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,545
Even an order from you...

249
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,384
I don't care!

250
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:39,512
Anyone who breaks the law must die!

251
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,347
But I can't do it!

252
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,350
Captain!

253
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,700
Why are you so angry?

254
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,130
It's what I do that makes me a captain!

255
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:58,102
Now hear this! I outrank all of you!

256
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:02,516
That means I'm the highest
commander of this base!

257
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:06,445
That means I'm the best!

258
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:11,476
I cannot be wrong in any way!

259
00:17:12,961 --> 00:17:14,317
Do you agree?

260
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:15,958
Yes! That's right, sir!

261
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,362
We can take care of him later.

262
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:23,108
See here! It took a lot time to make it.

263
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,296
It stands for my power.

264
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,366
Come! Make it stand up!

265
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:31,901
1,2...1,2...1,2...1,2...1,2...

266
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:31,901
In the highest place of this base!

267
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,085
That's strange... no one here.

268
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,418
We must find him first to
get that sword back... huh?

269
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:49,460
1,2...1,2...1,2...1,2...
1,2...1,2...1,2...

270
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,479
Heave! Heave!

271
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,292
What was that?

272
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:56,671
Did you bump that?

273
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,505
There is something up there.

274
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:04,208
I'm very sorry! I didn't notice!

275
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:08,113
It's the statue of me.

276
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,550
If there are any
scratches, you are finished!

277
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:14,417
Let's go have a look.

278
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:16,991
GOMU GOMU NO!

279
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:19,125
ROCKET!

280
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,526
You're dead!

281
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,564
Overshot!

282
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:24,859
What's that?

283
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,729
Something's coming this way!

284
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:28,177
Got it!

285
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,524
Sorry!

286
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:47,209
Get that guy! I want him dead!

287
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,212
Yes! We'll get him!

288
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:50,791
Father! That's the guy who hit me!

289
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:52,280
Oh! It's you!

290
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:54,390
I've come looking for you!

291
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,416
Come with me! I want something from you!

292
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,401
Let go, Sir Helmeppo!

293
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,427
Chase him! Don't let him get away!

294
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,902
Captain! There is someone in here!

295
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,276
What?

296
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:13,673
Another one digging his own grave.

297
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:18,616
Come on! Come on!

298
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:20,637
There he is! Don't let him get away!

299
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:24,727
Oh! Somebody got in the way!

300
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,052
Where is Zoro's sword?

301
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:33,929
I'll tell you! don't hit me again!

302
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,203
OK! Tell me!

303
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:38,173
In my room we just passed by

304
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,104
What? Why didn't you say so?

305
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:41,869
You make me turn back!

306
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:43,313
Don't move!

307
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,809
Let him go!

308
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,437
Don't!

309
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,976
Shoot if you dare!

310
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,349
No! Don't shoot!

311
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:53,750
Get out of the way!

312
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,557
You can go now, Zoro-san!

313
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:59,320
You'll be executed if you cut me loose!

314
00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:02,454
I don't like what they do...

315
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:06,034
I just want to... join the navy.

316
00:20:06,168 --> 00:20:09,069
Stop it! I can't run away now!

317
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,171
Ten more days!

318
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:12,367
You'll be executed tomorrow!

319
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:13,608
What?

320
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:18,103
Helmeppo's not intending
on keeping his word...

321
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:22,650
That's why Luffy hit Helmeppo!

322
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:23,979
That guy!

323
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,680
The navy is chasing Luffy.

324
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:30,951
I won't force you to become a pirate,

325
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,754
but I'm asking this

326
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,887
only you can give him a hand.

327
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:43,763
And he can save you now, Zoro!

328
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:47,603
You're the only one...

329
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,008
...who can assist him!

330
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,007
Halt!

331
00:20:56,118 --> 00:21:01,715
You commited a crime.
I'll execute you now!

332
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,354
Is it this room?

333
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:10,479
We got it!

334
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,200
But there are 3 swords.

335
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:15,363
Hey! Which one belongs to Zoro?

336
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,199
He is worthless and insensible.

337
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,300
Koby!

338
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:31,863
You dare to do this in my territory!

339
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:36,678
Trying to start a revolt with that kid!

340
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:40,286
I've been fighting alone.

341
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,422
It's quite different
with a man like you!

342
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,592
Roronoa Zoro,

343
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:49,260
don't get me wrong

344
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:54,485
no matter what you are,
you're nothing to me!

345
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:56,425
Ready!

346
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,173
<i>I can not...</i>

347
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,344
<i>...die in a place like this!</i>

348
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,082
<i>You're still a coward, Zoro!</i>

349
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,388
GOMU GOMU NO!

350
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,763
ROCKET!

351
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:17,180
Fire!

352
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:22,226
You! Luffy-san!

353
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:23,683
The man in the hat.

354
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:26,862
Liar!

355
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:30,745
They're useless!

356
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:38,051
Told you I was very strong!

357
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:41,150
Who the hell are you?

358
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:43,754
I'm Monkey D. Luffy...

359
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:46,578
...a man who wants to
be King of the Pirates!

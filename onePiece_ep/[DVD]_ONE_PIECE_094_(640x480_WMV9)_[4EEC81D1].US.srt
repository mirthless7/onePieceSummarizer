1
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:48,690
Meeting of the powerful ones!

2
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:48,690
Its name is Ace with the burning fists

3
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,050
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,180
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,560
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:11,390
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,940
Princess Vivi, accompanied by Luffy and her crew, finally arrived at the Kingdom of Arabasta.

8
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,720
They accosted with the port of the town of Nanohana.

9
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,280
While hiding Works Baroque,

10
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,160
they prepared in order to cross the desert and to stop the rebellion.

11
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,160
However, Luffy left before the others…

12
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,320
… and found itself, only, far from the city.

13
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,890
Year-Chan = Traveller

14
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,890
Oh! Anchan, I never saw you in the corner.

15
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,900
Is it the first time that you come in Arabasta?

16
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,730
What do you think about it?
Throw a glance there!

17
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,060
It is a gold apple!

18
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,690
Wait one minute!
I have something to say to you into private.

19
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,880
I found this extraordinary treasure when I explored old ruins!

20
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,940
If you eat a piece of this mysterious gold apple, you will be able to live during thousand years!

21
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,650
Afflicted, but to live during thousand years does not interest me.

22
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,780
It will be already well if I survive today.

23
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,540
A gold apple!?

24
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,200
To live during thousand years!?

25
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,130
Really? Really? Really?

26
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,790
You known as to have found it in old ruins!?

27
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,450
Yes, of course!

28
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,860
It is a legendary treasure inherited unmemorable times.

29
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,700
When one eats a piece of it, one can live during thousand years!?

30
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,450
Yes, I never lie.

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,910
Brilliant!

32
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,300
Dear customers, you seem to be experts.

33
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,590
Let us see seeing…

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,320
If you buy it now, I go down the price to 1000 Berry!

35
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,190
1000 Berry!? Really!?

36
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,380
It is taken! It is taken!

37
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,570
Good blood…

38
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,620
But of what do you think!?

39
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Do not believe all that one tells you.

40
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,930
He, they is good! Leave us quiet!

41
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,090
One can live during thousand years right for 1000 Berry! You do not include/understand!?

42
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,470
Stop with that.

43
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,070
One must find Luffy.

44
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,270
The purchases were finished. At once that one will have found Luffy, one will leave for the next city!

45
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,220
Moreover, I wonder well where is Luffy.

46
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,790
It is enough!

47
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,030
This type…

48
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,220
I would like to ask you something.

49
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,710
Did you already see this man?

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Hum? Monkey D. Luffy?

51
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,770
There are chances so that it is in this city.

52
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,860
I seek it here for some time already.

53
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,310
I never saw it.

54
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,680
Oh yes, if you seek somebody,

55
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,140
you should return to you to the restaurant which is a little low.

56
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,680
The owner is with the current of all that occurs in this city.

57
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,540
Thank you.

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,740
A restaurant, hum?

59
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,940
I in any event start to be hungry.

60
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,350
Who is it? It with the really strong air.

61
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,240
And why does he seek Luffy?

62
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,890
An bargain hunter?

63
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,040
Not.

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,850
It is not one.

65
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,320
This mark…

66
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,920
As an old hunter of pirates,
I will be able to never forget this mark.

67
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,670
But it is…?

68
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,920
I do not believe in it…

69
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,360
What a shame!

70
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,840
To sell this katana 200.000 Berry…

71
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,180
It is swindle!

72
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,730
Do you have at least a license of sale?

73
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,810
Oh, shit!

74
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,990
Roronoa Zoro, you are thus a pirate.

75
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,430
I…

76
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,340
You lied me!

77
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,350
A good-for-nothing like handling you such a splendid saber!

78
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,480
It is unforgivable!

79
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,930
Your Meitou, Wadou Ichimonji…

80
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
… will have to be seized!

81
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,350
This woman…

82
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,350
Why is it here?

83
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,240
Please, remade more never a thing also dishonest person.

84
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,510
Was I well made include/understand?

85
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,280
What do you make, Zoro?

86
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,620
Do you hide?

87
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,120
With each time I meet this woman, the troubles are never far.

88
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,030
Shit!

89
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,660
Eh, Tashigi.

90
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,240
Colonel Smoker!

91
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,270
A band of the large pirates playing hard ones.

92
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,880
They started to insult me while dancing in front of me.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,870
I stopped their spectacle.

94
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,820
Even if we are in this place moved away,

95
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,810
your vigilance towards the pirates is always also relentless.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,920
If you have time to lose in words,

97
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,280
why don't you call the royal army of this country so that it removes us from this refuse?

98
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,410
Yes!

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,940
We do not have yet any news of the arrival of Luffy to the straw hat in this city.

100
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
But remain vigilant!

101
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,700
It will be shown well early or late.

102
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Smoker…

103
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,480
It is well the Colonel of the Navy of Logue Town?

104
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,740
That would like to say that…!

105
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,620
What it could be well with our cases since we left Logue Town?

106
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,010
Look by there.

107
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,400
And there is also this other type which we saw… that becomes dangerous.

108
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,310
But where is thus this… idiotic?

109
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,020
I…

110
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,500
I am hungry…

111
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,860
Thank you well. Afflicted to take your lunch, Ossan.

112
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,410
I ate it too quickly. It is as if I had not eaten anything…

113
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,950
OR IS THE CITY!?

114
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,830
OR IS FOOD!?

115
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,280
To eat!

116
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,180
TO EAT!

117
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,470
Does Hey, what occur?

118
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,620
What did it arrive?

119
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,250
It seems that a customer died suddenly in it.

120
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,430
Died suddenly?

121
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,930
It would seem that he died while discussing with the owner the restaurant.

122
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,620
It is a traveller.

123
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,020
Everyone says that he undoubtedly ate a Strawberry of the Desert.

124
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,910
A Strawberry of the Desert?

125
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,640
It is a poisoned egg of spider which resembles a strawberry.

126
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,070
If one eats one of them, one dies suddenly a few days later.

127
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,640
Then, a few hours later, a contagious poison escapes from the body and is propagated in the air.

128
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,210
It is for that nobody approaches him.

129
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,500
In the desert, which one does not know can kill us.

130
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,130
Look at how that arrived:it was going to take another mouthful…

131
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,880
… and it solidified, like that!

132
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,400
That shows well the power of the poison of the Strawberry of the Desert…

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,640
IT IS RESSUSCITE!

134
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,690
is this E-that goes?

135
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,680
Sea…

136
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,590
Shit…

137
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,500
I fell asleep.

138
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,410
YOU DEADENED ES!?

139
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,010
This is not possible!

140
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,210
Right in the middle of a meal and a conversation!?

141
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,450
And it continues its meal as so nothing was…

142
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,240
And you, what you made here?

143
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,940
WE WORRIED FOR YOU!

144
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,540
You engaged of comic or a trick in the kind?

145
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,400
Eh well, not… but, if you are well, I am happy.

146
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,360
HEY!

147
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,750
YOU RENDORS NOT!

148
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,900
What? Then he had not died?

149
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,560
Which waste of time.

150
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,150
Ah, I am more hungry!

151
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,820
In the fact, Oya-San.

152
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,820
Oya = Landlord

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,070
What?

154
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,450
This type downtown, isn't this is not?

155
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,610
A pirate wearing a straw hat…

156
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,660
I suppose that to eat in public no difficulty arises.

157
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,380
Ordering the Second Division of the pirates of White Beard.

158
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,550
Portgas D. Ace.

159
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,000
Does bar Beard White!?

160
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,940
Pirates of White Beard!?

161
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,500
Does this imbecile belong to the pirates of White Beard!?

162
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,950
I knew well that I had already seen this tattooing…!

163
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,400
It is well the mark of the pirates of White Beard!

164
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,990
Why is it here?

165
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,300
What can attract well an infamous pirate like you in this country?

166
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,210
I am with research…

167
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,100
… of my little brother.

168
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:59,540
TO EAT!

169
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,400
Is qu What it?

170
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,570
There is a strange odor which comes from this place.

171
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,170
There!

172
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,350
A restaurant!

173
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,030
Then…

174
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,850
What should I make?

175
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,880
Sitted remainder and lets stop you to me.

176
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,080
Rejected.

177
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,610
Ca does not say to me.

178
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,700
Eh well, I expected it.

179
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,260
In any event, I am here in the search of another pirate.

180
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,210
Your head really does not interest me.

181
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,910
Then lets leave to me.

182
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,940
I cannot do that…

183
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,890
Because I am Navy…

184
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,940
… and you, a pirate.

185
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,040
Which reason idiot…

186
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,300
We thus will amuse we a little. Not?

187
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,910
A restaurant!

188
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,840
I finally found one of them!

189
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,330
Now I can eat! I am too hungry!

190
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,010
Ossan! To eat, eat, eat!

191
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
I am really hungry!

192
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,830
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

193
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,140
To eat, eat, eat!

194
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,350
Super!!!!!

195
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,090
Ca, it is a restoring good!

196
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,520
O-oui…

197
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,120
Thank you, but you…

198
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,320
You would make better of you be from there very far from here.

199
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,670
Why?

200
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,010
Do you know those which you have just sent in the air?

201
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,790
To send in the air? Who did that?

202
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,820
You.

203
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,680
I did that? With which?

204
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,580
A hole has why there here?

205
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,700
This restaurant is odd.

206
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,030
To make is holes your pastime?

207
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,990
It IS YOU WHO ACE MADE CA!

208
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,390
Me? When?

209
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,440
Jerk…

210
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,750
But which it was? Brothel…!

211
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,720
To be caught some with me…

212
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,520
It is what this idea? To do that with me to me…

213
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,700
Accept my excuses to have stopped your meal.

214
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,600
Who is this prehistoric imbecile who did that? Brothel!

215
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,020
Lu…

216
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,570
Eh, Lu!

217
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,850
STRAW HAT!!

218
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,140
I sought you, Straw hat.

219
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,390
I knew that you would come here, in Arabasta.

220
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,910
DECREE TO EAT!

221
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,150
Is it…

222
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,860
Finally there?

223
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,490
Luffy with the straw hat.

224
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,270
I said it to you:if you do not beat me, you will never go on Grand Line.

225
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,920
What, what, what…?

226
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,010
I ate the fruit Moku Moku.

227
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,100
My body can be transformed into smoke as soon as I want of it!

228
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,080
You include/understand now?

229
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,920
You will never go on Grand Line.

230
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,170
How I said it to you!

231
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,780
It is smoked out! What do you make there!?

232
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,420
Dumb…

233
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,530
Wait a little!

234
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,340
Thank you for the meal.

235
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,460
WAIT!

236
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,990
Wait, Luffy! It is me!

237
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,060
Eh, wait!

238
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,140
Eh! Luffy!

239
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,260
He eats while running…

240
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,430
Shit, my Gomu Gomu does not go on him!

241
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,250
Is better than I leave while running!

242
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,530
TASHIGI!

243
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,820
Yes, that is there Colonel Smoker?

244
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,530
Do you want a towel?
It is really hot here!

245
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,560
Catch it! It is Straw hat!

246
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,550
Straw hat!

247
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,310
I will cut it into two!

248
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,210
Tashigi!

249
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
Call all the Navy available urgently!

250
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,940
Seek his/her companions in all the recesses of this city!

251
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,670
Yes!

252
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,560
A fruit eater of the demon!

253
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,510
Incredible!

254
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,250
Pirates of Straw hat…

255
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,350
That wants to say…

256
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,630
Roronoa Zoro is in this city.

257
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,480
Straw hat, why did you come in this country?

258
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,720
What do you seek?

259
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,850
What? I am here for botter the bottom of Crocodile!

260
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,810
What? Crocodile?

261
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,890
What does Crocodile have to see with you?

262
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,780
It disappeared!

263
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,980
Dumb! Played well!

264
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,640
Straw hat!

265
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,060
I wonder where is Luffy-San…

266
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,390
It is shitting.

267
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,980
It is a Captain who always should be supervised.

268
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,540
Oh, Nami-San!

269
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,860
Oh, oh, I have bad news.

270
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,750
One would make better leave now.
This place is badly attended.

271
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,970
Badly attended?

272
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,470
The Navy is there.

273
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,380
Navy!?

274
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,850
And an odd guy too.

275
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,540
Let us find as quickly Luffy as possible and leave this city.

276
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,530
Eh, with ground!

277
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,130
What?

278
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,870
What occurs?

279
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,250
Navy.

280
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,700
One hears them since there.
They must have some after somebody.

281
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,120
Do not let it escape!
Do not lose it!

282
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,310
They are surely idiots of pirates who run on the place.

283
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,080
Idiots of pirates!?

284
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,110
Stop, Straw hat!

285
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,040
It IS YOU!?

286
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,790
Eh, Zoro!

287
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,700
Whoa, everyone is here!

288
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,790
Imbecile! Do not come!
They are still with your cases!

289
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,720
They are the pirates of Straw hat! They are seen!

290
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,030
Does Eh, what one make?

291
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,310
Our only option, it is the escape.

292
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,210
One must turn over to the boat!

293
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,050
You dispatch! Allons-y!

294
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,330
IMBECILE!

295
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,170
Halt! You will not escape!

296
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,780
Behind everyone!

297
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,470
Colonel!

298
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,800
Straw hat is with me!

299
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,900
Ah, it will have me!

300
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,530
You will not escape to me!

301
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,610
Still you…

302
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,760
Drop.

303
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,350
You are smoke, but I am fire.

304
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,280
Our capacities make a combat useless.

305
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,260
This guy has the capacities of a fruit of the demon?

306
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,070
But which is it?

307
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,340
Why does it help us?

308
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,790
Ace!

309
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,030
You did not change, Luffy.

310
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,080
Ace…

311
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,180
It is Ace!

312
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,390
You ace eaten a fruit of the demon!?

313
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,410
Ouais, the fruit Mera Mera.

314
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,880
Colonel Smoker! Which are your orders!?

315
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,430
We cannot speak now!

316
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,020
I find you later! Let us go away!

317
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,140
I deal with these guy!

318
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,930
Go ahead!

319
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,660
Allons-y!

320
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,700
But, Luffy…

321
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,140
Who it is this guy?

322
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,480
I do not include/understand.

323
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,110
Why did you help Straw hat?

324
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,290
A big brother always worries for his little brother when this one has troubles.

325
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,060
What do you want to say by “little brother”?
That wants to say that…

326
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,830
Release!

327
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,290
Portgas D. Ace!

328
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,810
Ca would astonish me.

329
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,720
Wait, Luffy. Say to us just who it was!

330
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,390
Do you know it, Luffy-San?

331
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,520
Ouais!

332
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,670
It is my brother!

333
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,220
BROTHER!?

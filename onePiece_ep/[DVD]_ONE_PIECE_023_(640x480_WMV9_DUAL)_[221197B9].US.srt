1
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:00,319
Here, Gin. Give it to him.

2
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,862
Here, Gin. Give it to him.

3
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:02,779
Sanji-san...

4
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:03,989
Thanks!

5
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:04,156
Thanks!

6
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,505
Isn't this a nice restaurant we have here?

7
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:21,924
Allow me to take it.

8
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,425
Allow me to take it.

9
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,888
So that's... why you came?

10
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,349
Indigestion Meatball!!!

11
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:30,599
Indigestion Meatball!!!

12
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,141
Indigestion Meatball!!!

13
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:31,975
Indigestion Meatball!!!

14
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,819
That tasted awful!!

15
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:43,487
That tasted awful!!

16
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:43,737
That tasted awful!!

17
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:44,071
That tasted awful!!

18
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:44,363
That tasted awful!!

19
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:50,577
Do as I say!

20
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:50,702
Do as I say!

21
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:51,370
Do as I say!

22
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,496
Do as I say!

23
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:53,580
When I tell you to get me some food,

24
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:53,956
When I tell you to get me some food,

25
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:54,998
When I tell you to get me some food,

26
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:55,666
When I tell you to get me some food,

27
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:56,458
then you should go get me some!!

28
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:56,708
then you should go get me some!!

29
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,209
then you should go get me some!!

30
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:57,459
then you should go get me some!!

31
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,252
then you should go get me some!!

32
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,629
Nobody disobeys me!

33
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,800
Here's enough food for 100 men.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,092
Here's enough food for 100 men.

35
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:05,342
Here's enough food for 100 men.

36
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:05,592
Here's enough food for 100 men.

37
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:05,842
Here's enough food for 100 men.

38
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:06,093
Here's enough food for 100 men.

39
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:06,426
Here's enough food for 100 men.

40
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:06,677
Here's enough food for 100 men.

41
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:09,018
Take it to your ship.

42
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:09,996
Owner Zeff!

43
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,141
''Z-Zeff'', you say..?

44
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:17,980
PROTECT BARATIE!
THE GREAT PIRATE, ZEFF THE RED LEG

45
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,027
PROTECT BARATIE!
THE GREAT PIRATE, ZEFF THE RED LEG

46
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:24,319
PROTECT BARATIE!
THE GREAT PIRATE, ZEFF THE RED LEG

47
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,834
What's the meaning of this?

48
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,377
What are you thinking?

49
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:42,713
If his crew gets better,

50
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:43,338
they'll take over the restaurant!

51
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,507
they'll take over the restaurant!

52
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:49,511
Only if they've got the guts.

53
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:52,389
Isn't that right? Mr.
Couldn't-Get-Through-The-Grand-Line?

54
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,142
Isn't that right? Mr.
Couldn't-Get-Through-The-Grand-Line?

55
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,646
N-No way..!

56
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,940
Even Don Krieg couldn't get through..?

57
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,358
Even the King of the East Blue...

58
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,151
Even the King of the East Blue...

59
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,444
Even the King of the East Blue...

60
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,362
with his 50 ship fleet couldn't get through?!

61
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,448
with his 50 ship fleet couldn't get through?!

62
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:11,491
The Grand Line?

63
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:16,663
You...

64
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:17,539
You're Zeff the Red Leg!

65
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,123
You're Zeff the Red Leg!

66
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,044
So you're still alive, eh?

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,339
The cook-cum-captain, one of
the greatest pirates in history.

68
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,924
The cook-cum-captain, one of
the greatest pirates in history.

69
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,968
I'm alive, so what?

70
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,804
It's not your concern.

71
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,431
As you see,

72
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,392
I make my living as a cook.

73
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:41,396
That's a nice way of saying it.

74
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,731
That's a nice way of saying it.

75
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:42,814
That's a nice way of saying it.

76
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,766
But from the look of things,

77
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,027
it's not that you chose to be a cook,

78
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,820
but it's the only thing you're able to do.

79
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,280
but it's the only thing you're able to do.

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,322
but it's the only thing you're able to do.

81
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:52,783
I've heard about Zeff the Red Leg.

82
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,784
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

83
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:54,201
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

84
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:54,785
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

85
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:55,536
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

86
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:55,786
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

87
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:56,036
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

88
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:56,578
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

89
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:57,162
He's an expert at fighting without his hands.

90
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:02,251
His legs are so strong, they can break rocks,

91
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:02,960
or even leave a footprint on iron.

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,377
or even leave a footprint on iron.

93
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:03,710
or even leave a footprint on iron.

94
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,044
or even leave a footprint on iron.

95
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:05,295
or even leave a footprint on iron.

96
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,965
He earned the name ''Red Leg''

97
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:08,590
from his shoes, dyed red with blood of his enemies!

98
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,883
from his shoes, dyed red with blood of his enemies!

99
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:12,386
from his shoes, dyed red with blood of his enemies!

100
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:20,060
But it seems that you've lost that
ever-so-precious leg of yours.

101
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,480
I heard a rumor that you had
an accident while sailing...

102
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:27,067
that you had an accident while sailing...

103
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:34,074
For you, losing a leg means
you can no longer do battle.

104
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,577
Why would I need to fight?

105
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,704
I don't need my feet to cook, as
long as I have a pair of hands.

106
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:39,496
I don't need my feet to cook, as
long as I have a pair of hands.

107
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:39,788
I don't need my feet to cook, as
long as I have a pair of hands.

108
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:41,290
I don't need my feet to cook, as
long as I have a pair of hands.

109
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,252
Just cough out what you really want to say.

110
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:48,881
Zeff the Red Foot,

111
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:52,634
I know that you're the only man who's
come back alive from the Grand Line.

112
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,845
I know that you're the only man who's
come back alive from the Grand Line.

113
00:05:55,971 --> 00:05:59,600
You must have kept a journal of that voyage...

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,351
You must have kept a journal of that voyage...

115
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:01,560
You must have kept a journal of that voyage...

116
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,687
Hand it over!

117
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:09,359
Not bad old man! So you've
been to the Grand Line, too?

118
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,277
Kinda...

119
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:10,319
Kinda...

120
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,906
Indeed, I have the journal,

121
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,325
Indeed, I have the journal,

122
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,578
but I'm not going to give it to you.

123
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:25,792
That journal isn't just mine, it's
the pride of my entire crew.

124
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,380
It's far too valuable for the likes of you.

125
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,425
Then, I'll have to seize it from you.

126
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:37,179
True, I couldn't get through the Grand Line.

127
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,139
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

128
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:39,598
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

129
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:39,890
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

130
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,140
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

131
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,390
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

132
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,183
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

133
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:41,600
But behold, for I am Don Krieg, the greatest!

134
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,896
I was strong enough to make it through.

135
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:48,690
I had enough men, enough ambition...

136
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,109
The only thing I lacked was information.

137
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,488
The only thing I lacked was information.

138
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:57,032
That's the only reason why I failed.

139
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,577
I must have that journal!

140
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:00,619
I must have that journal!

141
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:06,166
And organize another pirate
fleet to get that One Piece!

142
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,045
Then, I'll become the Pirate King!

143
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,766
Hold on there, bud!

144
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,058
Hold on there, bud!

145
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:23,642
The one to be Pirate King, will be me!

146
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:25,269
The one to be Pirate King, will be me!

147
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:27,563
It's the waiter boy!

148
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,691
Hey, get out of here waiter boy!

149
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,985
You're no match for him!

150
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,445
I can't do that.
Leaving things as they are.

151
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:35,571
I can't do that.
Leaving things as they are.

152
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,992
What did you say, boy?

153
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,078
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that...

154
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,705
You don't have to.

155
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,790
I'm just announcing the truth.

156
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,710
This is no game.

157
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:51,545
Of course it isn't.

158
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,797
I'll be the one who'll get to the Grand Line!

159
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,508
That's not funny, brat!!

160
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,760
It may have just been a lack of information,

161
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:02,639
but even a fleet of 5000 men
was defeated in seven days!

162
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:04,641
What makes you think you can make it?!

163
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:06,852
Sev... seven days?!

164
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:10,147
Krieg's men only lasted seven days?

165
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,357
What could've happened to them?

166
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,486
Sorry, but your humor is the kind I hate most.

167
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,865
If you insist,

168
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,576
shall I kill you off right now?

169
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,745
If you think you're up to it.

170
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:25,704
What?

171
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:32,961
Very well then. You want to
be sent to the next world?

172
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,729
Starting a brawl, Luffy?

173
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:52,189
Need a hand?

174
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,816
W-we don't have to, y-you know.

175
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,863
Zoro! Usopp! You dropped by!

176
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,865
It's okay. Just sit and watch.

177
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,283
Oh, okay... That's too bad then...

178
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:06,620
If you don't need us, there's nothing
we can do about that.

179
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:09,498
I-I'll help ya, if you still need it!

180
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:10,707
G-Good luck!

181
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,962
What the hell was that for, Zoro?!

182
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:16,964
Shut up and stay still.

183
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,344
Are those your men?

184
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,681
Are they all you've got with you?

185
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,349
What're you talking about?

186
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:28,684
There are two more!

187
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,644
Hey, why do you keep counting me in?

188
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,361
I'll take care of you guys later.

189
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,739
Right now, I need to feed my men.

190
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:50,956
For those who don't wish to die, you'd
better not be here when I return.

191
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,710
The only things I want are the journal,

192
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,044
and this ship.

193
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:02,676
However, if you really want
to throw your lives away,

194
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,780
I'll have to go out of my way, but I'll be happy
to send you to the bottom of the ocean!

195
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:08,682
Keep that in mind.

196
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:27,659
It's gotten kinda quiet..

197
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:29,953
Zoro-aniki went to check things out.

198
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,580
You think something happened?

199
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,249
You really think everything will be okay?

200
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,335
How would I know...

201
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,128
Hey Nami-aniki!

202
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,214
Should we go check it out too?

203
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:45,802
Aniki?

204
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,982
N-Nami-aniki?

205
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,568
Oh, what's up?

206
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:02,945
Anything the matter?

207
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:19,753
I'm sorry, Sanji-san.

208
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,548
I never would've imagined things
to turn out this way...

209
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:26,218
I don't need an apology from the likes of you, fool!

210
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,599
We are but cooks in this establishment.

211
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,685
We'll feed anybody who comes along.

212
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,061
Owner!

213
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,231
Why are you siding with Sanji?

214
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,941
What's going on here?

215
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:41,942
Yeah!

216
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:45,279
This is all his fault!

217
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,657
He's going to destroy your precious restaurant!

218
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:50,742
Shut the hell up, you stupid eggplants!!

219
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:57,124
Have you ever had the experience
of starving to death?

220
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,586
Can you imagine how horrible it is?

221
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:07,759
Having no food and water in this vast ocean?

222
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,638
W-what do you mean, Owner?

223
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,685
The difference between all of you and
Sanji is that he knows that feeling.

224
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,690
What does he mean?

225
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,901
What does Sanji know about?

226
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,740
Rather than just standing idle with petty talk,

227
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,284
you'd all better leave this place now!

228
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,748
I'm staying right here to fight!

229
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:41,210
I can't simply let them trample over me!

230
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,085
Me too!

231
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,963
This is where I work!

232
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,466
I have no place to go to anyway.

233
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,017
What are you doing?!

234
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,853
Didn't you seen how strong our leader is?

235
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:01,104
Hey, Gin.

236
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:08,403
Feeding the hungry is what being a cook is all about.

237
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:09,613
However...

238
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:18,121
Now that your captain's all filled up,
he's nothing more than a plunderer.

239
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:23,210
Whatever I do to your pals,
don't come bitchin' at me.

240
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:29,132
I'll kill anybody who tries to take
this restaurant! Even you!

241
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:30,884
Got that?

242
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,267
Heh! You saved his life just to kill him
off? You're so thoughtful, Sanji.

243
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,269
Shut up, you fat-ass cook!

244
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,813
Didn't I tell you he was something?

245
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:44,982
Who cares about him now?

246
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:47,317
Let's just get the hell out of here!

247
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:48,193
Calm down.

248
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:51,405
Even though he's Krieg, he's all battered up.

249
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,490
Hm? Gin!

250
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:57,202
You said once before that you knew
nothing about the Grand Line, right?

251
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,012
But you have been there, haven't you?

252
00:14:04,918 --> 00:14:07,129
The truth is I don't know anything.

253
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:12,342
What happened at the Grand
Line on the seventh day...

254
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,927
Was it a dream..?

255
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,430
Or reality..?

256
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,267
It's still fresh in my mind...

257
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,812
It was unbelievable...

258
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:27,858
Just one man...

259
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,739
Destroyed a whole fleet of 50 ships!

260
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,288
WHAT?!!

261
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:46,376
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

262
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,425
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

263
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:06,079
It all happened so suddenly.

264
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,608
He showed up out of nowhere and

265
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,861
started sinking our ships, one after the other.

266
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,369
If a storm hadn't come along,

267
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:24,097
our maiden ship would've been destroyed too.

268
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,342
I have no idea how many of
my mate's ships survived.

269
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:40,097
But it was too scary for me to accept it all.

270
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,516
I don't want to even think about what had happened!

271
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:44,810
That man...

272
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:48,981
His stare pierces through you,

273
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,358
Like the eyes of a hawk!

274
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:52,901
What?

275
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:56,613
What did you say?

276
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:02,202
That guy...

277
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:06,081
He must be the man know as Hawk Eyes.

278
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:13,797
The fact that you noticed his eyes,

279
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:17,067
Leads me to belive that it was him.

280
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:19,653
It all sounds like something he would do.

281
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,222
The Hawk Eyes Man!

282
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:24,391
Eh, you know that guy, Zoro?

283
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,313
That's the man I've been looking for.

284
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,233
I sailed across the oceans in search of him.

285
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:39,323
Maybe he had some kind of grudge
to settle with you guys.

286
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,116
Not that I know of.

287
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,869
Perhaps you disturbed his nap.

288
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,245
Stop the bullshit!

289
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,041
Why in the world would he destroy our fleet just for that?

290
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,002
Don't get so worked up.

291
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,795
I'm just making assumptions.

292
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:59,885
Stuff like that happens at the Grand line.

293
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:02,179
Just what kind of place is that?

294
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,015
A place where anything can happen.

295
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,392
Hey Luffy!

296
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,561
Stop this right now! We can't go there!

297
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:10,771
Luffy!?

298
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,194
Hey, Luffy?

299
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,864
Gah!! I'm so pumped up!

300
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,194
I was hoping the Grand Line wouId have all this!

301
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:25,619
Can't you be more concerned about your safety?

302
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:29,998
But with all this talk, now my destination
wiII reaIIy be the Grand Line.

303
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:33,460
That man...

304
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,255
I can definitely meet him there!

305
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,133
Are you morons?

306
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:43,929
You must be those who are eager to die.

307
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,556
That's right.

308
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,616
But it's none of your business.

309
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,353
When I decided to become the greatest
swordsman in the world,

310
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,272
I threw away the rest of my life.

311
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,859
I'm the only one who can say that I'm an idiot.

312
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,739
Me too! Me too!

313
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,951
As a man of the sea, same here!

314
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,035
Cut the lying.

315
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,039
Fools.

316
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,170
Hey, hey!

317
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:22,009
Do you bastards realize what's going on here?

318
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:28,640
Don Krieg's ship is right in front of this restaurant!

319
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,769
Do all the talking only after we get out of this mess!

320
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,576
Yahoo!!

321
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,536
We're alive!

322
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:50,823
It's like a dream.

323
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:53,592
We've finally escaped from that nightmare!

324
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:57,711
We're back from the pirate
graveyard, safe and sound!

325
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,256
That's right.

326
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,969
Now that we've recuperated, we can
head back to the Grand Line.

327
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:12,184
Huh? What's with that look?

328
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,145
W... we're going back there again?

329
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:25,864
Anybody else objecting?

330
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:42,047
First, we're dumping this battered ship.

331
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,799
Then we attack the restaurant.

332
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:47,344
Our opponents are a bunch of punk cooks.

333
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,596
They shouldn't be of any threat.

334
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,485
ATTACK!!

335
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,591
Here they come!

336
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:10,951
I can hear them!

337
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,661
We won't let them through!

338
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,122
'Coz this ship is our restaurant!

339
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,045
Run in fear, you cooks!

340
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:43,984
What?!

341
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:46,361
What the hell was that?

342
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:48,405
Don Krieg!

343
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:50,782
The ship...

344
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:53,327
has been split in half!

345
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,578
Split in half?

346
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:56,205
''Split in half'', you say?!

347
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,415
My biggest ship...

348
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:03,837
No way! That's impossible!

349
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,113
Go hoist the anchor!

350
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,432
Or our ship'll get pulled under with them!

351
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:16,183
Yes, Boss!

352
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,020
This is bad.

353
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,940
Nami, Yosaku, and Johnny are still on our ship!

354
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,902
Damn it! We may already be too late!

355
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,623
Aniki! Aniki!

356

1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,020
One Piece treasure present! The first keyword is... this!

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,440
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,610
At the Judiciary Tower

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,500
Robin learnt Luffy and the others were coming to recue her.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,500
Wait! Isn't this different from our arrangement!?

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,150
The condition for me to accept to collaborate with you

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,560
was supposed to be letting them get away safely!

8
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,050
Didn't they set off Water 7 safely and then come here?

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,390
This is desesperatly dirty... They don't even have a fragment of humanity!

10
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,090
Ah...? What did you say?

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,770
Shut up, you filth!

12
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,890
We don't even have the obligation to keep our promises with criminals like you!

13
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,200
Take this, take this, bastard!

14
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,630
You too!

15
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,350
Don't become so cocky!

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,160
Coward...

17
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,780
The receiver is off the hook.

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,300
Cutty Flam goes to Impel Down.

19
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,650
Nico Robin goes to the Marine Headquarters.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,250
As soon as the departure preparations are done, take them through the Gate of Justice.

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,110
The CP9 can return to their private rooms and take a break.

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,130
My subordinates are such promising guys...

23
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,090
As long as they are here, I don't feel like I could lose to anyone!

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,540
On the other side, riding the kingbull and following after Luffy, the Straw Hat crew

25
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,760
were progressing with ease.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,760
Don't come aboard as you wish!

27
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,800
He's our captain. His will is strong! Get us to Luffy in the Main Island, kingbull!

28
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,740
"By the way, the masked guy who was with you didn't come aboard, is that okay?" He says.

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,070
Sogeking is nowhere to be seen!

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,980
M-Major! This is terrible!

31
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,690
What's wrong?

32
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,500
Straw Hat Luffy...

33
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,950
We lost sight of Straw Hat Luffy...!

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,400
Search for him! We must absolutly track down the Straw Hat!

35
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,570
Finally getting on the Courthouse's roof.

36
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,800
So this is the last building..

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,900
Yosh.

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,710
What?

39
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,020
Air Door

40
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,410
Ah! You're the cow who was with the pigeon guy!

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,300
I thought the information about the damage report being of five was wrong...

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,080
Ah, it surprised me.

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,110
Since the beggining of the World Government, this is the first time this happen.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,560
To have a man sneak up to the entrance of the Government.

45
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,260
Until when

46
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,300
do you plan on fighting?

47
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,560
Until I die.

48
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:37,050
Give back Robin!
Luffy vs Blueno!

49
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,580
What should we do!?

50
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,210
Anyway, we can't go back for the ones who didn't come aboard now.

51
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,470
He'll manage to do something by himself.

52
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,350
But this is an island covered by soldiers!

53
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,660
He's not Luffy and if we leave him alone, his life will...

54
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,010
On our journey across the islands, all of us became stronger without even noticing.

55
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,500
He too has overcome death on every island we passed by.

56
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,900
We don't have anyone who would die so easily our crew!

57
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,420
We don't have anyone like that in our crew.

58
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,260
Everytime? Our crew?

59
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,230
What are you saying, Zoro!?

60
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:32,890
Sogeking was asked by Usopp to help us save Robin... and then he came to us!

61
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,390
He is...

62
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,770
An invincible hero, right?

63
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,350
That's right!

64
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,510
If it's the justice's super hero, Sogeking, then...

65
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,550
He'll certainly...

66
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,840
I was too late to get on the kingbull.

67
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,990
What should I do...? I fell behind the others a lot...

68
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,810
Senkanhou

69
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,170
But those shipwrights are awesome!

70
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,840
Whatever happens, I left the crew.

71
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,300
Should I run away?

72
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't, I can't do that! Running away is the only thing I can't do!

73
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,580
The man Usopp! Didn't I hide my identity all the way and then arrived here!?

74
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,330
Robin had to surrender herself to protect the crew when it was important!

75
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,870
I must fight no matter what happens!

76
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,480
Alright... There is only one way to reach everyone else!

77
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,320
Let's go with the "Disguising into a government employee

78
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,610
and pass through the other government soldiers" great strategy!

79
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,920
This is goo-

80
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,400
W-What!? What is this!? A flooding!? Oi! Enemy attack, enemy attack!

81
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,210
The giant woke uuuuuuup!

82
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,790
We tried for 50 years and failed! We're sorry, bosses!

83
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,240
Bosses?

84
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,960
We are Elbaf's shame!

85
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,220
Elbaf?

86
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,200
Elbaf... Bosses...

87
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,940
Maybe...!

88
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,400
Could it be that you came from the warrior's village, Elbaf?

89
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,160
Who the hell are you!?

90
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,580
I... I am Sogeking from the Sniper island!

91
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,250
C-Could you tell me more about that story?

92
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,470
Why should I have the obligation to tell this to a tiny guy like you!?

93
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:00,180
Hey, calm down! Aren't Elbaf's warriors the proudest men in the world?

94
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,420
If you are crying over this, it must be extremely important!

95
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,080
I want to know that reason!

96
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,310
Please...

97
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,510
I have no choice but to tell even someone like you.

98
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,790
Me and Kaashii too...

99
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,000
Since 100 years ago we were pirates. We were running wild throughout the world.

100
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,240
But someday on an certain island...

101
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,530
Cheers!

102
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,380
Those two killed a freakingly huge Sea King each!

103
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,870
We may be Elbaf's Giant clan,

104
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,110
but only our bosses can beat monsters of that calibre! Right, everyone!?

105
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,850
Surely this is our greatest catch!

106
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,190
Yea, they're the biggest ones ever.

107
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,810
And which one was the biggest?

108
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,080
Which

109
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,650
one?

110
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,000
It seems like mine is a little bit bigger.

111
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,990
Cut the crap! Mine is bigger than yours by 3 centimetres!

112
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,510
What!?

113
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,090
What is it!?

114
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,030
Bosses!

115
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,250
Please stop!

116
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,610
Our two bosses started fighting.

117
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,200
It was a battle that put the bosses' pride at stake.

118
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,910
Got no choice.

119
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,980
This is the battle's signal.

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,180
The crew was dissolved. Everyone had to return to our homeland.

121
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,280
What he is talking about...

122
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,250
It's Little Garden!

123
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,510
Only the victor of a life or dead fight should be able to go back to his village

124
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,120
but even after dizains of years nobody came back.

125
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,080
After 50 years, thinking this was strange

126
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,200
I and Kaashii set out to the sea to bring them back.

127
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,630
But got captured by the marines on our way there and were forced to give them all kind of informations.

128
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,550
That's when they told us the frightening truth.

129
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:21,720
That those two strong bosses were imprisoned in the government's great prison!

130
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,770
This is a story of about 50 years ago.

131
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,500
The government gave us conditions.

132
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,740
If me and Kaashii work for the government during 100 years...

133
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,320
In other words, if we could protect the Enies Lobby's gates during 100 years

134
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,780
they would release our bosses and let us return to our homeland Elbaf together.

135
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,450
A giant's lifespan is 300 years. There's nothing about giving them 100 years

136
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,000
Under those conditions, we fought for 50 years.

137
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,020
But today pirates breached the door!

138
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,950
I never thought such a thing would happen! Shit!

139
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,020
Because of this the bosses will be in a cage for the rest of their lives!

140
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,180
Oi, oi! W-wait a sec!

141
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,870
That story is weird...

142
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,490
What's funny!? If you are going to laught about our pride...!

143
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,650
No, no, no! Not that 'funny'! I mean that it's weird!

144
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,350
Weird, you say?

145
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,990
You see, during our journey to come here, we met with those two!

146
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,380
The Elbaf's warriors you are talking about,

147
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,180
Dorry and Broggy, are still continuing since
100 years their endless fight on that island!

148
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,180
Eh? You... Why do you know their name? No, that's impossible!

149
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,270
If you want to know about that, I'll tell you as much as you wish!

150
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
And then...

151
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,930
You still don't believe me? What should I say for you to believe me!?

152
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,160
Their weapons!?

153
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,640
Their techniques!?

154
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,140
73466 fights...

155
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,750
I know everything!

156
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,520
73466 draws...

157
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,660
I REALLY MET WITH THEM!

158
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,960
You protected our pride with all your might.

159
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,240
So whatever strong enemy it may be

160
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,330
we won't let our friend's pride down.

161
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,340
Believe in us and continue straight forward!

162
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,410
Let's meet once again!

163
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,480
Absolutly!

164
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,230
Straight ahead! Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

165
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,750
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN EATEN!

166
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,330
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

167
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Hakoku
[Warrior nation]

168
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,950
We flew out!

169
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,140
They cut the ocean itself!

170
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,560
This is the strength of Elbaf's warriors!

171
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,780
Saa, go!

172
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,560
Seeing those two as masters...

173
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,720
I swore to myself I would someday become a man with such high pride!

174
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,650
Won't you believe my words!?

175
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,550
That they have been imprisoned for over 50 years

176
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,300
IS A BIG LIE!

177
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,500
The bosses are still alive, right?

178
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,740
Is that so? Thanks godness!

179
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,410
That's really great!

180
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,870
Hey! We're almost at the Courthouse!

181
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,540
Absolutly kill/stop it.

182
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,580
Damn, kingbull!

183
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,110
Great! We stopped one!

184
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,890
Sodom!

185
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,600
Sodom! This is terrible! We must treat him immediatly!

186
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,870
Sodom, hang on! Don't fall yet!

187
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,300
Guys, hurry to get on this side! Don't just stand there!

188
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,740
Sodom is done for!

189
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,670
That mortar got his heart! Hurry before he collapses!

190
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,520
If you don't move forward who will do it in your place!?

191
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,810
He says 'Go!'!

192
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,610
He's collapsing!

193
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,020
Nobody is on it!

194
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,890
What did you say?

195
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,410
Oi.

196
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,740
Let's go Gomorrha!

197
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,650
Robin is in that building behind you, right?

198
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,930
Move from there, cow!

199
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,340
It seems like you and the others still didn't notice it.

200
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,880
That what you are doing is a great offense/crime against the whole world.

201
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,760
What do you want to say?

202
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,300
Across the world's oceans, we have influence over more than 170 affiliated countries.

203
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,020
When you decided to invade this island owned by the massive organization known as the world govrnment

204
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,020
it meant you also declared war to those countries.

205
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,570
The government will put its dignity at stake

206
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,760
and make all of you wanted criminals throughout
the world before you making suffer cruel deaths.

207
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
You are at most a 10 mens.

208
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,880
This is quite a small power.

209
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,340
I only told you to get out of the way.

210
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,550
Whether I move or nor...

211
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,550
I only warned you there wasn't any future for all of you who broke through Enies Lobby's gates.

212
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,370
Fighting is also useless.

213
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,900
I think you saw enough of our fighting style the
Rokushiki in the Galley-La mansion to understand.

214
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,610
As well as the difference of power between us.

215
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,130
That's right...

216
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,180
But in this moment...

217
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,340
I don't feel like losing at all!

218
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,630
Gomu Gomu no

219
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,320
Tekkai

220
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,410
Rifle

221
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,940
What...? When I fought this man in the mansion, I'm sure he didn't have such power!

222
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,540
Gatling gun

223
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:12,940
Soru

224
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,930
Whatever about the world, or about the government.

225
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,800
Do what you want with those things.

226
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,270
We only came here to take Robin back!

227
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,590
This is bad, even Gomorrha was hit!

228
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,380
We'll get encircled by enemies this way!

229
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,550
There's only one road!

230
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,210
Let's break in!

231
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,250
Next time, One Piece: Don't stop! Give the signal of a counterattack!

232
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,950
I will become the... what's with that nose? O_o

233
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,240
Here's the way to get your present!

234
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:40,880
Write the four letters that appeared in the show, your adress, your full name, your age, your opinion on the show and you may win a lot of prices!

235
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,490
The last keyword is... this ! [Finally done ^^ Usopp should learn to shut up]

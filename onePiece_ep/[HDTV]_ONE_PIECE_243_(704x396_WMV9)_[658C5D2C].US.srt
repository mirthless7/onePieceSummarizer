1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
I have the sketches of the Ancestral Weapon, Pluton!

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,960
Protect Iceberg-san!

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,270
Trust me.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,620
Let to me occupy itself some.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,119
Maaa, I count on you.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,329
They are so numerous.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,679
With the least forgery not, one is foutu.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,269
It is you who says that?

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,989
We are not entitled to the error.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,520
Ouais.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,790
CA EXPLODE!

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,840
Something of terrible occurs!

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,220
Where is Luffy?

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,950
Bring to me that.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,529
And us your life gives.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,360
The attempted murder of yesterday is nothing beside this evening.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,879
According to our charter, we represent justice.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,489
The secret organization…

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,560
Cipher pol. Number 9.

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,400
I see. Thanks to Luffy, we are likely thus to enter.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,280
One sinks, of agreement?

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,209
WHY ALL THIS WORLD?!

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,620
I wedged myself and I cannot any more moved.

24
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,389
I must hurry.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,290
Await me, Robin!

26
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,959
Are shit, where parties?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,940
A couple and a small beast are only which one is sure.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,069
Do we have to protect the room?

29
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,439
The engineers are there already.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,949
But a handle of guards would not make the poid.

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,800
Let us give them a knack.

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,670
It is what?!

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,489
There is somebody!

34
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,669
He moves towards the room on the third floor!

35
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,499
All the guards are out of combat!

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,229
That somebody comes please!

37
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,730
THAT SE PASSES IT?!

38
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,899
Tileston-san!

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,579
KAKU AND LUCCI ARE JUDICIOUS TO BE THERE!

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,779
On this subject…

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
WHAT?!

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,529
KAKU! LUCCI!

43
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,009
Pff, that will thus finish never.

44
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,919
Still not of call?

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,780
DUMB!

46
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,959
It IS YOU WHO DID THAT!

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,989
Which noisy character.

48
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,409
DID YOU TOUCH WITH ICEBERG-SAN?!

49
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,919
Check by yourself.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,510
TENKAI!

51
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,459
Its giant bludgeon…

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,700
It is a joke!?

53
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,460
WHY YOU…!

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,709
RELEASE ME, DUMB!

55
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,369
You are proud of your superhuman force?

56
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,120
I cannot move! I cannot lose a duel of force!

57
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:22,070
the uncovered CP9!
Their true face.

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,629
Its giant bludgeon…

59
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,680
It is a joke!

60
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,430
WHY YOU…!

61
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,759
RELEASE ME, DUMB!

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,609
You are proud of your superhuman force?

63
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,320
I cannot move! I cannot lose a duel of force!

64
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,340
All the engineers are…

65
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,419
Need for reinforcements!

66
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,590
SORU!

67
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,929
They are over there!

68
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,559
It is Roronoa Zoro!

69
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,020
You show yourselves finally!

70
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,799
I saw this girl presently! Chopez it!

71
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,589
He, why Luffy is not there?!

72
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,950
I was going to ask for the same thing…

73
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,599
Whore.

74
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,559
In any case, one was made take in full red-handed.

75
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,180
Since you are so malignant, finds a solution.

76
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,129
He Zoro, what you insane?

77
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,309
Ca is not used for nothing to run like that.

78
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,670
Let us find Robin, and let us know the truth for all once.

79
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,109
But they are the workmen who attack us!
They are not our enemies!

80
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,850
They is good. I use the back of my blades.

81
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,290
OUT OF MY SIGHT!

82
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,130
You make them super evil nevertheless!

83
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,419
Maaa…

84
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,089
I am surprised.

85
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,680
Frankly, I did not think you of meeting, Nico Robin here.

86
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,429
Some share was already seen?

87
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,750
Not.

88
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,629
Yesterday evening was the first time.

89
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,509
But I believe that…

90
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,290
I always wanted to meet you.

91
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,830
I always had this research opinion in my room, like not forgetting your face.

92
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,180
Would you like an autograph?

93
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,960
I would be delighted.

94
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,040
Would this be to kill me?

95
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes, before you do not destroy the world!

96
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,200
Why do you seek Ponéglyphes?

97
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,609
The government issued for a long time that the study…

98
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,569
And the decoding of Ponéglyphes were illegal.

99
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,080
You should hold account of it.

100
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,209
You are with the current of the existence of Ponéglyphes?

101
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,349
To know that is not illegal.

102
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,959
But the only person of this world able to decode these letter…

103
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,940
It is you only.

104
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:57,900
Therefore the government you ace allotted a large premium since your eight years.

105
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,079
Because you are only.

106
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,860
You are the only one who can make revive the Ancestral Weapon!

107
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,909
I see.

108
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,220
You are even with the current for the Weapon.

109
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,750
Nevertheless…

110
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,519
It would seem that organization CP9 exists indeed.

111
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,289
Thus, you left the crew of Straw hat in order to help the government.

112
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,299
Odd for a woman sought since twenty years, but…

113
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,500
Maaa, that does not look at me.

114
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,689
If the Weapon is ressuscitée by the decoding of Ponéglyphes…

115
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,759
That it is for justice or not…

116
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
The result is the same one.

117
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,999
To make return the Weapon in this world will not bring back peace.

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,510
The world will be destroyed.

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,640
The mysterious things of last should not be awaked.

120
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,989
Yes, I am of agreement.

121
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,539
But all this does not look at you.

122
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,659
It does not matter my method to study the history…

123
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,600
An unknown does not have to make me morals.

124
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,710
It is not true.

125
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,130
To some extent, I am in the same situation as you.

126
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,410
I have…

127
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,700
I have the sketches of the Ancestral Weapon, Pluton!

128
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,249
Sketches of the Weapon?!

129
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,610
Pluto is the name of old a navire de guerre builds on this island a long time ago.

130
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,889
Engineers at the origin of this weapon of such a power…

131
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,859
Considered to be useful to create a force of countermeasure in the event of loss of control.

132
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,639
Thus the sketches are transmitted generations in generations.

133
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,460
The government wants them, and employs the strong manner for that.

134
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,479
That you cooperate with them in this way… Ca disgusts me.

135
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,939
Tom, the man who entrusted these sketches to me…

136
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,399
Always worried about the girl…

137
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,059
Who escaped all alone from the incidents of Ohara twenty years ago.

138
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,159
In spite of its low age…

139
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,249
She was this dangerous young girl who carried in her the blackness of the demons of Ohara.

140
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,019
For this reason me, on which rests the hopes of the workmen, I have the duty to stop you!

141
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,709
Now that the government is with the current of the existence of the sketches…

142
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,909
It would be preferable to burn them.

143
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,499
But I cannot do that now…

144
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,010
Because as a long time as you will live, the possibility of resurection will persist!

145
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,969
It is all that you have to say before dying?

146
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,549
Afflicted to say that to you…

147
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,619
But even if you kill me in order to avoid the resurection…

148
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,260
Once the sketches were found, the result is the same one.

149
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,530
Maaa.

150
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,340
Let to me say a thing…

151
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,719
It is you who fell into my trap.

152
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:32,750
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

153
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,070
Over there!

154
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,299
I finally arrived there. It was horrible!

155
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,839
Good, I pass to the attack now.

156
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,039
I will catch Robin.

157
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,509
GOMU GOMU NO…

158
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,150
ROCKET!

159
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,490
You do not make the weight.

160
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,430
Hurry to give us that.

161
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,570
You will stain it blood.

162
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,700
Shit.

163
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,640
I believed capacity to gain.

164
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,149
In fact…

165
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,190
Iceberg-san had said to me to flee as soon as possible.

166
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,550
To throw this trick and to run.

167
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,289
Because…

168
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,200
It is a forgery!

169
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,889
What?

170
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,980
A forgery? What a dumb!

171
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,289
I do not know who you are but your mission has fair.

172
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,729
Well done for your mouths.

173
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,889
I do not even know what you seek.

174
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,059
Which arrogance.

175
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,990
You believe capacity berner also easily the CP9?

176
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,419
Even if it were a lure…

177
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,380
Now that you know too much of it, one must finish some with you.

178
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,609
I am wedged!

179
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,869
Shit, I am still wedged!

180
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,269
Why it is always like that?!

181
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,330
Straw hat.

182
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,759
Ah, encordé!

183
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,389
What did it arrive to you?

184
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,379
You are well? Be to you covered with blood!

185
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,299
You are really unforeseeable like guy!

186
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,589
I could say as much of it! It is the third stages here!

187
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,980
Luffy with the straw hat, would you have come to make you show?

188
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,989
Ah, of the masks!

189
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,359
It is you masked!

190
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,519
It is you who had told Robin to do all that!

191
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,610
Return to me Robin, jerks!

192
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,319
Shit! Oi, known as something!

193
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,639
[Rankyaku = storm of legs]

194
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
RANKYAKU

195
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,610
It split the wall with a kick!

196
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,970
Straw hat!

197
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,410
It is what?

198
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,569
We have an urgency, we do not have time to chatter with you.

199
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,669
I cannot move!

200
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,879
Oi, attaches the other too. There are not time to fight!

201
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,130
Yes.

202
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,899
Ka-cha

203
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,619
It is me. We have unforeseen in the plan.

204
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,869
That everyone gathers in the room.

205
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,390
Do not kill Iceberg-san yet.

206
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,330
I repeat, do not kill Iceberg-san yet!

207
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,540
I would play well still with you, but…

208
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,399
Forgive me, I have more important to make.

209
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,239
What?! You hope to ravel yourself?!

210
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,510
Not.

211
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,480
I have another thing to make, then I shorten.

212
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,479
Excentric-san was made beat in a blow!

213
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,519
Impossible!

214
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,550
Wait!

215
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,760
It still flew away!

216
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,580
You are well?

217
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
It is nothing.

218
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,079
I see.

219
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,059
Straw hat, why did you come here?

220
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,919
Everyone is persuaded that you are the culprits.

221
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,909
Too quickly excuse me to have judged you…

222
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,929
Does not make any you. One with the practice to be persecuted.

223
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,089
In any event, one of our companions was made have by these masked guys.

224
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,420
It is for that I came to recover it.

225
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,550
Is Nico Robin, it that?

226
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,289
You manage with the combat, not true?

227
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,289
Ouais, I am strong!

228
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,229
Can you overcome them?

229
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,590
Yes!

230
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,689
Then fight at my sides!

231
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,939
I want to burst them, me too!

232
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,529
Of agreement.

233
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,859
Of course!

234
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,589
Why… Why Iceberg-san should be made kill by people whom one does not even know?!

235
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,999
It is a joke!

236
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,699
Who are these guys?!

237
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,950
A secret organization? My bottom, of the jerks!

238
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,050
It is…

239
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,769
My benefactor.

240
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,079
Why let kill the man who made ego a proud carpenter?

241
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,149
But considering your state…

242
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,419
I You AI SAY THAT I WANTED TO BURST THESE DUMBS!

243
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,590
IT DOES NOT MATTER IF MY BODY DOES NOT SUPPORT!

244
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,949
I WOULD FIGHT UNTIL MY LAST BLOOD DROPS!

245
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,369
FILTHS!

246
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,879
RELEASE me!

247
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,769
YOSH! RELEASE me!

248
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,960
FILTHS!

249
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,190
You break!

250
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,590
I do not have anything to give you!

251
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,390
It is damage.

252
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,000
By where to start?

253
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,449
You disappoint me…

254
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,570
You, who soon will die.

255
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,289
Lucci!

256
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,390
It is you the faulty one.

257
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,140
It is thus because you do not have gave it to the government whereas they asked it gentillement to you.

258
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,140
Kaku!

259
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,820
We wanted you to leave, you and this city, without making stories.

260
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,039
Kalifa…

261
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,099
I see that you inherited the obstinacy of your Master.

262
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,580
Blueno, the barman.

263
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,909
You all were…

264
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,389
Members of the government.

265
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,459
Yes.

266
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,349
We to dissimulate among the others was not difficult.

267
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,909
But…

268
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,850
I was astonished by your wisdom.

269
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,920
Then, Iceberg-san…

270
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,790
The hiding-place of the sketches of Pluto, the Ancestral Weapon…

271
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,500
Say to us, before there are other victims.

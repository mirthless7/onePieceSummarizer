1
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:04,860
Luffy is entirely encircled!

2
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:04,860
The secret plan of the Admiral Nelson

3
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,520
Oh… One is outside! Outside!

4
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,170
That they immediately are continued!

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,370
Still a thing, Major! Erik-San also returned and it goes up in this moment on the boat.

6
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,990
They try to catch up with us!

7
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,850
The Merry Vogue can sail more quickly, but…

8
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,280
Will He, what one make arrived at the Gunkan island once?

9
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,470
Worry you!

10
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,680
How that?

11
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,490
As long as one finds the nest of the dragons in first

12
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,830
and what one gives Ryuji on feet, it is essence, not?

13
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,480
It will not be easy.

14
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,390
The small fish entered our nets!

15
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,170
How all the ships are put in range!
Akuyoku Formation!

16
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,100
Oh not… One is taken with the trap!

17
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
One will board their ships,
their foutre a beating and to break these chains.

18
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,970
It is the only solution.

19
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,360
It is not a so bad idea.

20
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,850
Well! Ahead!

21
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,040
One arrives!

22
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,840
Marvellous! What a splendid spectacle!

23
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,300
Especially do not stop the attacks only one second!

24
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,760
Yes!

25
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,120
But…

26
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,740
My invaluable due must remain intact!

27
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,070
Yes, Admiral!

28
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,810
Sennenryu which I sought during so a long time

29
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,640
is finally with my range.

30
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,960
And the elixir of youth of Ryukotsu will be soon with me!

31
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,830
Report!

32
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,150
The flagship announces that the plan is a success!

33
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,220
They will continue the attacks on their side!

34
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,250
It would be said that our mission is finished.

35
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,570
If that continues, they will fall right into the hands from Nelson Royale.

36
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,190
Wait, Major!

37
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,880
What still?

38
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,580
Prepare to me a boat with
three men to row.

39
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,420
A boat?
For what to make?

40
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,360
If not your masts will be destroyed.

41
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,420
You are insane!
You will enter the circle?

42
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,720
Make, it is to it all!

43
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,760
Apis! They is dangereous because of here,
go down in the hold!

44
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,130
I cannot leave Ryuji alone!

45
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,430
He, wait! Return!

46
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,150
He, they is dangerous, return here!
I cannot help you if you tombs.

47
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,910
Ryuji!

48
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,530
Hold good still a little, Ok?

49
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,410
One will bring you to the nest of the dragons, Ok?

50
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,170
Ah… which courage.

51
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,510
I have the tears with the eyes of them.

52
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,850
Very well! After having reduced these boats in parts, one will bring you to the nest of the dragons!

53
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,310
One touched us by behind!

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,100
He, Sanji! One is touched!

55
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,220
Sanji!

56
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,630
One died! One will run!

57
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,730
The farm! They missed us!

58
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,350
Ah? Really?

59
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,050
Yes!

60
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,220
Ah, saved… Which is the imbecile
who made me this stupid joke?

61
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,880
It is you!

62
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,650
They is good! They is good!

63
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,920
Ahead!

64
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,530
He! A boulet de canon arrives by here!

65
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,900
I can nothing make of other,
you ace that with you to occupy some!

66
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,710
Well, I will test that!

67
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,670
Incredible!

68
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,330
Incredible!

69
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,990
This immonde small freluquet, how he dares
to touch one of my men-of-war?

70
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,940
What do you wait?
Deploy the gun of massive destruction!

71
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,420
Yes!

72
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,160
You will not be able to escape!
You will not be able to escape!

73
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,980
You will be with me!!

74
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,650
Prepare you to draw with the gun from massive destruction!

75
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,920
The pirate vessel is out of cheek!

76
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,850
Loan to make fire!

77
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,380
It is what that?

78
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,790
If one is touched by this trick, one will finish in crumbs!

79
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,530
Worry you! I will reforward it once again!

80
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,140
Do not say conneries!
One must change course!

81
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,710
Quickly, will move the back!
Dispatches you

82
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,630
Eye for eye! I will show you what I am able!

83
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Here it is done!

84
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,730
Take that!

85
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,870
Fire!

86
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,760
Made fire!

87
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,060
What did it occur?

88
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,780
The enemy gun drew on ours!

89
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,560
What do you have says?

90
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,280
You dispatch and help me to raise me!

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes!

92
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,210
Then you liked?

93
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,070
It is what arrives when
Usopp-Sama becomes serious!

94
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,010
It was certainly bowl.

95
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,910
Yes, surely.

96
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,510
What? I can remake it when I want! Look at me!

97
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,370
Wahou! What a shooting!

98
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,710
Usopp, they was super!

99
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,910
All will be well.

100
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,010
Worry you! Remember, you must protect Apis!

101
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,720
With which you speak?

102
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,750
In Ryuji.

103
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,400
It is our chance now.

104
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,990
Cut the chains and clear us an exit
as long as they are surprised.

105
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,320
Yes, Nami-San.

106
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,660
Luffy!

107
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,050
Let make me!

108
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,670
Ok!

109
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,380
Ryuji!

110
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,330
Await me here!

111
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,570
Me v' there party!

112
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,210
Afflicted, Zoro!

113
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,510
You…

114
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,870
I want a total return of the situation!

115
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,430
Yes!

116
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,370
Three pirates approached the man-of-war
with starboard nearest.

117
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,190
Hein? How is this possible?

118
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,850
Steel chains!

119
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,340
You can cut them?

120
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,280
There is not only I donot can cross.

121
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,740
Well. Go ahead!

122
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,320
It would be said that they all are here.

123
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,360
I would like to take the part of right-hand side.

124
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,230
As you want.

125
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,090
I let to you do the housework.

126
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,730
Ok!

127
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,240
To have reversed the Admiral Nelson,
we will not let all to you break.

128
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,480
Yes! Yes! Go ahead! Go ahead!

129
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,020
It is brilliant!

130
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,690
Cut them!

131
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,700
Cut to them all!

132
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,210
Shit!

133
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,060
How you of the pirates of shoddy goods dare you to cut my barrier?

134
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,660
Capture them at all costs or
I will put all at once to you with irons!!

135
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
They arrive!

136
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,120
Incredible!

137
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,490
They are really strong…

138
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,060
There remains only one chain!
I will operate the boat!

139
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,640
Yes chief!

140
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,040
Not! Not! That somebody stops them!

141
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,300
Oh Erik! Played well!

142
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,870
Maintaining Sennenryu is with me!

143
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,020
Hein? Which fun…

144
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,310
It is you the fag who ate the Okama fruit.

145
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,940
Not “Okama” but the fruit Kama Kama!

146
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,940
Okama = Fag | Kama = a scythe

147
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,440
Gamine! You must leave me this Sennenryu now!

148
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,390
Not question! I will never give you Ryuji!

149
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,420
The farm and leaves the-us!

150
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,280
Not!

151
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,700
You know that I can use my Kamaitachi
to cut out you as much as I wish it.

152
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,370
Stop!

153
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,340
If you touch this child,
I will never forgive it to you!

154
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,520
It is true, Usopp-Sama will not let to you do that!

155
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,700
Bandage the innocent ones.

156
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,490
The Kamaitachi last missed its express target.

157
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,640
Stop me once again and the next one will make fly.

158
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,070
I will reduce your boat of pieces.

159
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,740
What is there?

160
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,580
It is still him.

161
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,010
Hein? It does what?

162
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,980
Quickly! Fasten the raft with the boat!

163
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,510
It would be said that it took Apis as an hostage to steal the dragon.

164
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,120
It is not well that!

165
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,040
Wait! If you try to strike it,
it will kill Apis and the others!

166
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,610
I see! I include/understand!

167
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,790
Then, I will strike it!

168
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,260
You me listenings at least?

169
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Maintaining Sennenryu is with me,
especially, do not want me.

170
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,550
Salt bastard! Return to us Apis!

171
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,250
Erik, excel work!

172
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,440
Now, the-I pays!

173
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,490
I do not think!
I believe that I will keep it for me.

174
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
What do you tell?

175
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,650
I only obeyed you to profit
information network of the Navy.

176
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,620
Traitor!

177
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,580
One is in the same ship, not true?

178
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,830
You only engaged me for your interest.

179
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,250
I gave you a colossal sum!

180
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,220
You gave me it is a true little argent de poche.

181
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,220
But I am not obliged to respect the orders of a large Morse like you.

182
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,150
A Morse? A Morse???

183
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,790
With Ryukotsu of this Sennenryu,

184
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,050
I will become invincible!

185
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,980
You will pay it to me… You will pay it to me!

186
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,060
Kill this traitor!

187
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,800
Fire! Fire!!

188
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,480
They draw again…

189
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,740
Avoid these boulets de canon!
If you want to live, I suggest you rowing!

190
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,970
Stop!

191
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,870
Stop!

192
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,580
I ask you not to maltreat Ryuji never again!

193
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,500
Ryuji anything did you!

194
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,760
Quiet remainder!

195
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,760
One must as fast as possible bring back Ryuji to the nest of the dragons!

196
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,620
Please, stop!

197
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,950
What you made? Release me!
Put back me immediately!

198
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,580
Stupid gamine! You are my hostage,

199
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,420
and your Sennenryu belongs to me from now on.

200
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,500
I will never give Ryuji to a monster such as you!

201
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,030
Never I will give up it!

202
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,810
That is enough, small plague!

203
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,800
Still a word and I reduce to you in parts.

204
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,790
That is enough!!

205
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,570
This gamine bit me well!

206
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,330
He! Return!

207
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,020
Return immediately!!

208
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,760
Shit!!!!

209
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,580
Ryuji! Test that! They is good!

210
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,980
He, Ryuji, eat!
And you will be better, Ok?

211
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,320
Oh it is so nice!
That suits you well, Ryuji!

212
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,010
Make conceal it!

213
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,170
Ahhh!! My ears!!

214
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
Ryuji howls with death.

215
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,500
Ryuji!

216
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,470
You can move! I am so content!

217
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,330
I am so content!

218
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,010
Hein?

219
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,080
It is not true?

220
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,310
What is this…

221
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,850
… what it manufactures?

222
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,710
It is that! Go, Ryuji! You can fly!

223
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,250
It succeeded! Ryuji flies!

224
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,480
Not question!
I want this dragon for me!

225
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,350
I will not let this Sennenryu escape!

226
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,710
Fire! Cut down it!!

227
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,950
Stop!!

228
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,440
Ryuji, flies!

229
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,590
Fly out of reach guns.

230
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,850
Fly!

231
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,030
It is that! You dispatch, cut down it!

232
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,830
That is enough!!

233
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,990
Flee before they réattaquent, Ryuji!

234
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,590
What do you wait?
Open fire!

235
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,480
Yes!

236
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,770
We must descend it!

237
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,600
Ryuji! Not by there!

238
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,730
With what he does think?
He moves by here!

239
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,490
Quickly! Cut down it!!

240
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,780
It arrives! Fire! Fire!!

241
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,110
Ryuji!!

242
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,500
Ryuji, holds good!

243
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,480
He! About what you do speak?

244
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,920
You should not think of dying.

245
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,030
Yes. I know.

246
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,010
I will take care of Apis,

247
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,020
and I will bring you to the nest of the dragons.

248
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,560
Then fight!

249
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,270
Ryuji!!!!!!!

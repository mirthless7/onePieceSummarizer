1
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,720
For the sake of defeating this man!

2
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,540
THREE SWORDS SECRET TECHNIQUE!

3
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,710
Don't regret it after you die!

4
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,240
THREE THOUSAND REALMS!

5
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,700
ZORO!!!

6
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,300
-THE EMERGE OF THE SUPERB KICKING SKILL!
-SANJI VS THE TRON WALL PEARL.

7
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,710
Ha!! They wanna fight too!

8
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,060
This is so exciting!

9
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,430
Old man, let's make a deal!

10
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,180
If I kick 'em out,

11
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,520
I won't need to work here anymore, ok?

12
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,240
It's all that I could wish for.

13
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,830
If I really let you work here for a year,
This restaurant would cease to exist.

14
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,360
Great!

15
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,310
Becoming the Pirate King. Are
you serious about that?

16
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,620
Yeah, of course!

17
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,660
I WILL become the Pirate King!

18
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,010
I see a lot of people who talk beyond their strength.

19
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,800
But I rarely see someone who says it so confidently.

20
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,470
I heard that you were once a very strong pirate.

21
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,640
You also wanted to become the Pirate King, right?

22
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,760
I have forgotten about the past.

23
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,820
Right now, I'm the Head Chef of this restaurant.

24
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,100
This is enough.

25
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,980
Men!!!

26
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,910
As long as we have that ship, we don't
need to fear the Grand Line anymore!

27
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,020
This is better than disguising as a marine ship,

28
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,990
Or giving up by waving a white flag.

29
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,230
That ship will make it easier to get
near the enemy and make a raid!

30
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,730
It's perfect for carrying out deceptive tactics.

31
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,280
After looking at that ship...

32
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,670
No one will ever imagine that it's full of pirates!

33
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,090
But... but Don...

34
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,960
Even thoug we can go to the Grand Line...

35
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,160
What will happen if we meet someone
like Hawk Eyes Mihawk again?

36
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,390
What are you still afraid of?!

37
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,390
No... nothing...

38
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,370
Do you think that a normal person
can split a ship in one stroke?

39
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,840
That is the power of the devil's fruit.

40
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:43,610
According to legend, there are lots of people in the
Grand Line who possess the power of the devil fruit.

41
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,120
Like Mihawk, who must have used a
special power to cut the ship apart.

42
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,720
That straw hat guy won't be anything special
once he enters the Grand Line.

43
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,700
However, Red Leg Zeff has been
there for a whole year.

44
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,770
I can only guess that Zeff has used some kind
of strategy to confront those monsters.

45
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,030
A strategy that he should have written
down in that Journal he possesses.

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,480
Also, information about One Piece might be included.

47
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,330
I see! You're so great, Don Krieg!

48
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,580
With that ship and the Journal, we will have
the opportunity to get One Piece!

49
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,270
Do you understand now, men?

50
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,920
Let's go and steal the ship!

51
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,310
That ship belongs to us!

52
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,970
We absolutely can't give it to them!

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,780
No matter the cost!

54
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,330
How do you move this?

55
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,810
Hurry up!

56
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,890
The restaurant will become a battlefield...

57
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,900
I was thinking about a restaurant on the sea...

58
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,570
I can survive and leave here, I'll bet the
rest of my life on a huge restaurant.

59
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,380
I'll bet the rest of my life on a huge restaurant.

60
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,900
Go to the control room and open the 'Fin'.

61
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,960
Eh! That...? Open the 'Fin'...

62
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,870
We're gonna give the enemy a place to fight?

63
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,030
Who cares?

64
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,740
We can't let the inner part of the
restaurant become a battlefield.

65
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,490
If we fight inside, The old fart'll never shut up.

66
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,660
Did you say something, you little shit?

67
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah, I said you never shut up!

68
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,660
Go.

69
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,260
They're finally here! Here they come!

70
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,590
And here I go!

71
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,600
GOMU GOMU NO ROCKET!!!

72
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,810
That guy is flying here!?

73
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,970
And...

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,690
GOMU GOMU NO SCYTHE!!!

75
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,120
Way to go! Waiter boy!

76
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,820
What... what the hell is he!?

77
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,080
In the Grand Line, there are many
of these kinds of people...

78
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,460
Sanji.

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,640
Watch carefully how he fights.

80
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,940
Watch him until the battle finishes.

81
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,730
They gave you food to eat, but
instead you attacked them!

82
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,080
You don't even know how to be grateful!
I'll send you to the sky!

83
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,910
You've chosen to fight on the sea
where there is nowhere to stand.

84
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,930
I know people who possess the power
of the devil fruit are afraid of the sea.

85
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,490
Hammer boy.

86
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,680
But I can stretch instead!

87
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,870
Sanji!

88
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,500
The 'Fin' is going to open!

89
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,710
What is this!

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
From the sea...

91
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,480
A platform just appeared outta nowhere!

92
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,500
Wow! That's so cool!!!

93
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,880
Why don't we fight to our hearts content, pirates?

94
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,230
Oh So I see

95
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,050
The restaurant won't be harmed.

96
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,420
How convienient for us since we're going to take it.

97
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,320
Now I want this ship even more.

98
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,360
Don't you ever think about having this restaurant!

99
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,020
Yeah! Don't underestimate us!

100
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,020
We are fighting cooks!

101
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,800
Let's go!

102
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,710
Baratie's sea weapon 'Sabagashira #1'

103
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,780
Those who are afraid to die,
grab your shoes and run!

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,920
What is that?

105
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,300
Cool!!! I want one too!

106
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,350
Pedal faster!!

107
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,180
I'm trying to!

108
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,560
Fire!!!

109
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,450
It's going to sink!

110
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,440
Good! Great!

111
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,380
Patty, Carne! Finish them!

112
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,230
It's not bad.

113
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,120
Don't look at the other side! Target them directly!

114
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,150
Krieg! Take this!

115
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,850
I'll show you the power of Baratie Restaurant's sea Weapon!!

116
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,950
What happened?

117
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,160
Did it hit something!?

118
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,900
It doesn't move!

119
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,490
I am Don Krieg!

120
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,240
The man who will conquer the world's sea!

121
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,400
I've told you before that I'll be the one to do that.

122
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,960
I don't have time to play these games!

123
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,470
What strength is this?!

124
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,760
It's flying over here!!!

125
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,480
The restaurant is going to be destroyed!

126
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,190
Sanji!

127
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,890
Leg...

128
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,350
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

129
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,330
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

130
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,590
What a kick!

131
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,860
He just kicked away that strange ship thing!

132
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,120
Was that kick technique...

133
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,220
It appeared! Sanji's kick!

134
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,300
Not bad!

135
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,310
Sanji! You bastard!

136
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,850
You tryin' to kill your own people!?

137
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:21,980
Yeah.

138
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,190
Whaddya mean 'Yeah'?! I'll
cook you like an octopus!

139
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,970
You nearly lost us a powerful weapon!
You Italian Spaghetti!

140
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,070
This is no time for babbling! Everyone...

141
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,910
Let's go!

142
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,680
Even though you carry weapons,
cooks will always be cooks.

143
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,780
There's a large difference compared to us!

144
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,390
Go do your cooking in some
kitchen on the mainland!

145
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,060
Hey, why are you losing so easily?!

146
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,480
Is that what you call fighting cooks?!

147
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,250
They are strong, completely different
than the pirates we've fought before!

148
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,740
Don't compare us with those useless pirates!

149
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,950
We are Krieg's Pirates, the king of East Blue!

150
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,680
Announce it!

151
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,020
Tell everybody that this ship
belongs to the Krieg Pirates!

152
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,920
Forget it!

153
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,680
You won't step one foot inside here.

154
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,090
Right!

155
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,550
We've been cooks for more than ten years

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,680
And we've been in 300 restaurants.

157
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
During those days, We'd be fired
every time we started a fight.

158
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,740
Then finally, we arrived at this place!

159
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,880
Is anyone here?

160
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,390
Is Red Leg Zeff's Restaurant here?

161
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,650
Is it true that damned cooks are welcome?

162
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,630
Yeah, it's true.

163
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,340
It doesn't matter if they're evil or
if they're an escaped criminal.

164
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,890
Whenever someone comes here hungry,

165
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,090
I'll let them be full.

166
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,350
Both of you are ready for this?

167
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,430
Aye !

168
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,670
How can you serve this disgusting
soup to our customers?!

169
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,100
Why did you hit me?!

170
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,620
This represents my determination Don't complain!

171
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,460
Here we can fight and cook as much as we want.

172
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,270
There's isn't another great restaurant for us like this!

173
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,580
That's right. Understand, Krieg?

174
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,130
Every day preparing meals is like a battle.

175
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,720
These guys are nothing compared to those days!

176
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,430
Right!

177
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,560
Let's fight!

178
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,730
Protect the restaurant!
Protect the Owner!

179
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,490
What is...

180
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,170
What are you doing?

181
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,460
Who is he?

182
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,720
Iron Wall! Also known as Krieg Pirate's
Invincible Iron Wall Shield Man.

183
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,220
It is I, Pearl san!

184
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,970
Pearl!

185
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,170
Patty, Carne are you OK?

186
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,050
How could they be OK?!

187
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,170
They were defeated by my killing
punch, 'Pearl's Present'.

188
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,530
Great! Great!

189
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:01,700
Great! Great!

190
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,870
This knife's not bad. I'll take it.

191
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,540
Let it go, give it to me!

192
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,040
Leave it!

193
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,880
You bastard, leave it!

194
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,160
He really knows how to kick!

195
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,920
I'm definately interested in him...

196
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,160
A knife is the soul of a cook.

197
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,100
An outsider doesn't deserve to touch a cook's knife.

198
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,650
Sanji...

199
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,210
Hold onto it and lay there.

200
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,200
I'll finish these guys off.

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,990
We won't be defeated by a bunch of useless cooks!

202
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,580
What do you mean by useless cooks?!

203
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,650
I'll gut you like a fish!

204
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,210
Are you so arrogant that you only kick them?

205
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,790
Is this your principle?

206
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,220
A cook's hands are his life.

207
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,060
He cannot injure them in battle.

208
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
So I'll finish you with these feet.

209
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,190
Finish me?

210
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,720
Impossible.

211
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,920
In my last sixty one battles, I have won
them all COMPLETELY unharmed.

212
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,910
I have never even spilled a single
drop of blood in a battle.

213
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,390
Not a single drop.

214
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,790
This justifies how strong I am.

215
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,030
I'm the strongest of the strongest!

216
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,570
I'm strong, huh?

217
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,420
Is he joking? It's not very funny!

218
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,950
Hey, straw hat guy!

219
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,260
If you look somewhere else, you'll get hurt!

220
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,980
Even the Marine's cannons can't resist me.

221
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,810
No attacks can hurt me.

222
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,070
He scared me!

223
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,030
I nearly fell into the sea...

224
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,250
Oh no...

225
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,980
Oh no, blood!

226
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,750
Pearl, everything is alright!

227
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,410
It's only a little nose bleed!

228
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,500
Not an injury caused by the battle!

229
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,960
Pearl, don't worry about it!

230
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,040
What happened?

231
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,050
This this this this is dangerous!

232
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,800
He looks strange, what happened to him?

233
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,550
Something about the nose bleeding?

234
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,320
Stop it, Pearl!

235
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,940
Don't get mad over a nose bleed!

236
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,370
What the hell is he doing?

237
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,340
BODILY HARM! BODILY HARM! BODILY HARM! ! !

238
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,620
Stop it, shit!

239
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,790
When Pearl gets threatened, he sets himself on fire!

240
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,960
What did you say?

241
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,270
FIRE PEARL!

242
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,080
Special favor!!

243
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,560
Ah! It's hot!

244
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,710
Pearl! ! Don't be like this!

245
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,270
Hey, you guys...

246
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,930
With these shields of fire, I'm indestructible!!!

247
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,690
Idiot!

248
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,190
Are you planning to burn the ship
that we are going to steal?

249
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,470
Hot, hot, hot!

250
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,060
Shit.

251
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,150
Damn it!

252
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,220
We can't jump into the sea with this fire!

253
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,160
Oh no! The restaurant will be burned!

254
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,000
He really wants to burn this restaurant.

255
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,970
Burn! Burn!

256
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,710
Bastard!

257
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,600
Stupid! You're gonna get fried! !

258
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,770
Sanji!

259
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,590
Don't you dare burn this restaurant!

260
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,680
How come he's so impudent!

261
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,510
Isn't he afraid of becoming a fire ball?

262
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
He even attacks Fire Pearl, someone
who is even feared by beasts!

263
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:01,900
Baka.

264
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,980
If I'm afraid of fire, then how
can I call myself a cook?

265
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,260
Argh! What an annoying guy.

266
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,280
Get this!

267
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,940
That hurt!

268
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,700
Pearl's Iron Wall was broken!?

269
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,980
What kind of cook is he? This isn't good!

270
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,530
Damn! Damn! Damn it!

271
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,810
Fire! Fire!

272
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,350
Fire Pearl keeps on burning!

273
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,980
The restaurant is going to be set on fire!!

274
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,050
If those fire balls get into the kitchen,
then the restaurant is finished!!

275
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,480
Owner! Run away!

276
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,190
Owner!!

277
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,510
My Fire Pearl...

278
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,960
This is nothing.

279
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,170
He blew out the fire with the wind of his kick!?

280
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,340
How can that be!?

281
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,240
Is it that Red Leg Zeff still has his skills?

282
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,850
The old man is strong!

283
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,940
If that's how it is, then I'll sink you and your 'fin'
into the sea before the fire burns the restaurant!

284
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,360
Sanji, be careful!

285
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Oh no! He's surrounded by fire!

286
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,280
Hot! Hot!

287
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,210
The waiter boy!

288
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,600
GOMU GOMU NO BAAZOKA!!!

289
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,020
He shot back that spkiked ball!?

290
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,780
Pearl is defeated!

291
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,690
Pearl san!!

292
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,900
What was he doing?

293
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,020
This guy is stupid!

294
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,070
Every single time,

295
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,540
I have to do it by myself in the end!

296
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,080
This time you can end it, right?

297
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,340
Yeah! Shoot him!

298
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,810
The Red Leg Chef!

299
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,600
You only need to kill him and the restaurant is ours!!

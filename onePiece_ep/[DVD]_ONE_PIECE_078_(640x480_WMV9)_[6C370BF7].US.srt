1
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:25,070
Is Nami sick?

2
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:25,070
Beyond snow which falls on the ocean!

3
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,800
Right in front!

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,990
What do you tell?

5
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,830
One was already eaten!

6
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,170
Right in front! Right in front!

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,780
HakoKu!

8
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,780
Hakoku = Nation of the warriors

9
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,310
One passes through!

10
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,250
One is not turned over!

11
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,280
One sinks right in front!

12
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,300
Terrible!

13
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,050
It was terrible!

14
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,430
They have even open the ocean!

15
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,240
Here true forces it… of a warrior of Elbaf!

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,640
It is incredible!

17
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,580
Maintaining the friends!

18
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,090
With the next one!

19
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,220
Many years ago,

20
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,010
a terrible crew known as the Giant Warlike Pirates sailed on the oceans.

21
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,260
Two leaders of these pirates,

22
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,240
Brogy the red ogre and Dorry the blue ogre,

23
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,900
had a terrifying capacity!

24
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Their force was unimaginable for the human ones and their similar.

25
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,570
And the manpower of the crew of the pirates started to decrease.

26
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,620
But what put an end to their wandering,

27
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,420
according to the rumors only one little girl is.

28
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,090
Did you recover spoils of the boss a little today?

29
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,550
Yes, that remotivé me, I cannot be calmed more!

30
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,890
After all, they killed each one enormous a monstre marin!

31
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:27,030
We are perhaps giants of the tribe of Elbaf but only the boss can beat such monsters!

32
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
Isn't this, you others?

33
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,350
Yes!

34
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,700
You are right!

35
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,580
This ruffle surely our greater exploit!

36
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,920
Largest that one ever cut down!

37
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,630
Then, which was largest?

38
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,740
… Which?

39
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,930
Who gained the contest of hunting?

40
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,730
Look at Brogy well. It would be said that mine is very small little the larger.

41
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,190
Be insane for you! Mine is at least 3 cm larger!

42
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,400
What?

43
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,190
It is what, that?

44
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,280
Owners! Stop, please!

45
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,460
In the fact, Brogy.

46
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,460
It would be said that I forgot something of important.

47
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,620
To tell you the truth, similar for me.

48
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,550
The central volcano!

49
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,750
At all events, let us stop good once for all!

50
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,690
Yes! I will remember it once I will have beaten you!

51
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,490
Do He the guy, you know what?

52
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,240
One day, I undoubtedly will visit Elbaf, the village of the warriors!

53
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh yeah!

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,580
Ge… Ge… giant!

55
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,000
Ge… Ge… giant!

56
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,710
El… baf… baf!

57
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,010
Everyone is so enormous!

58
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,510
Because they are giants!

59
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,970
Enormous giant old men!

60
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,140
Immense pirates!

61
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,010
These deux-là has energy to resell.

62
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,140
All this history really washed me.

63
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,150
Vivi, can you on top keep an eye during a moment?

64
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,420
Now, you will be able to finally return in Arabasta.

65
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,350
So of course, we do not strike anything on the way.

66
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,180
Yes, I must return to the house.

67
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,140
Now, the only means of saving my country is of…

68
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,220
Ca can be only you, Princesse.

69
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,560
Now, your father, the King, does not control any more his subjects.

70
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,780
The only means of stopping this insurrection is that you directly say the truth to the people.

71
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,400
For this reason, you cannot allow you to die.

72
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,950
Whatever the sacrifices to be made or people whom you will have to betray, you must remain in life!

73
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,450
It will be hard.

74
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,160
Princess Vivi…

75
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,920
Do you promise not to die?

76
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,380
I will arrive at Arabasta alive.

77
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,310
Do not worry you too much, Vivi-Chan.

78
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,440
I am there!

79
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,020
What would you say to release you by tasting my small snack bars of today, small furnaces?

80
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,610
And as drink we have tea or coffee, with your suitability.

81
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,740
Sanji-San.

82
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,620
Ouah that with the good air!

83
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,660
Your snack bars are in the kitchen!

84
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,330
Yosh!

85
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,910
I am the first inside!

86
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,170
What do you make, Luffy?

87
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,970
2606…

88
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,060
If I had been able to cut out this wax,

89
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,150
I would not have needed anybody!

90
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,280
I am weak…

91
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,030
I must become stronger,

92
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,500
until I can cut this wax in all the positions!

93
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,550
Kingdom of Arabasta

94
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,550
The sand Island

95
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,760
Mr. 2!

96
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,170
Bonclay-Sama!

97
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,720
Swanda is ready to leave!

98
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,010
Okay, okay!

99
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,220
Close it a little.

100
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,140
Good blood, why do I have to do that?

101
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,350
You can occupy you very well of waste like Mr. 3 yourself!

102
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,190
Not, please!

103
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,510
Even if we attack it all together, we cannot beat it!

104
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,900
Please, just this time!

105
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,400
It is an order of the Boss himself after all!

106
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,410
One, two, three…

107
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,410
I wonder who am the 4?

108
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,710
This oaf of Zéro-Chan!

109
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,340
Vivi…

110
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,460
Afflicted, I must go…

111
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,970
With my cabin…

112
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
They is good, Nami-San.

113
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,230
I will supervise our direction, you can go to put back you.

114
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,400
Does that go?

115
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,870
Everyone, come quickly!

116
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,660
Why? What is there, Vivi?

117
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,120
Nami-San disappeared with an high fever!

118
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,830
Does Nami-San have what?

119
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,110
Won't Nami-San die?

120
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,240
Isn't this, Vivi-Chan?

121
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,630
It is probably due to the climate.

122
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,760
One of the obstacles against which the travellers butt invariably who return on Grand Line

123
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,640
is the threat due to the supernatural climate that there is here.

124
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,180
It is not rare for intrepid pirates,

125
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,230
even those with enormous reputations on the other oceans, to succumb to the climate.

126
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,190
Even thinnest of the symptoms can lead to dead if it is not treated immediately.

127
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,860
Nami-San!

128
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,320
Is this somebody on board has a minimum of medical knowledge?

129
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,710
But it will be better if it eats meat!

130
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,000
Not, Sanji?

131
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,630
Eh well, I will prepare his favorite dishes to accelerate his re-establishment but…

132
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,710
an indigestion would be harmful.

133
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,760
To nourish will perhaps not be sufficient.

134
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,090
And in addition to that, we are at sea.

135
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,270
I make the dishes of Nami-san and Vivi-chan with hundred times more care than yours.

136
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,480
I give them the freshest vegetables and meat.

137
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,520
And all that is rotted,

138
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,110
it is what nourishes you, the guy.

139
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,730
He!

140
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,530
But that has good taste nevertheless!

141
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,820
At all events, as long as I am the chief cook of this boat,

142
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,290
there will be never problem of food.

143
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,290
But to prepare a meal for a sick person, there are so many things to consider.

144
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,690
Which are its symptoms and which they as regards nutrition ask?

145
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,250
I cannot make this kind of diagnosis.

146
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,800
Then gives him of all.

147
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,350
Which sick person will have energy to swallow all that?

148
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,510
4… 40°C!

149
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,970
The fever climbed!

150
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,020
There will be doctors once we will arrive at Arabasta, not?

151
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,190
How long does it remain us before arriving over there, Vivi?

152
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,690
I am not sure but I do not believe that one can arrive there in one week.

153
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,650
To be sick is really so painful?

154
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,450
Do not know, I was never sick front.

155
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,780
You are who with the Juste?

156
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,790
Don't you see at which point it suffers?

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,790
A fever of 40°C, it is nothing!

158
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,000
Ca means that it is a real danger to its life!

159
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,670
Will Nami die?

160
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,840
On you and you calm take!!

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,430
We must find a doctor!!

162
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,470
We must save Nami!!

163
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,470
I know, calm you please!

164
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,390
You will disturb it!

165
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,140
Not.

166
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,980
Not.

167
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,480
Nami-San.

168
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,610
Ouah, it is cured!

169
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,240
Not, they is false!

170
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,280
On my drawing table,

171
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,700
there is a newspaper.

172
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,880
Direction… straight.

173
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,750
Not…

174
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,670
It is not possible…

175
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,990
He, that is there?
It is what the problem?

176
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,090
It is in connection with Arabasta, Vivi-Chan?

177
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,180
300.000 imperial soldiers fled to join the rebellious army.

178
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,940
At the beginning, there were 600.000 imperial soldiers fighting against 400.000 rebels.

179
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,360
But in one moment, gives it changed…

180
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,990
Now, the rebellion with Arabasta starts to gain ground.

181
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,660
The newspaper goes back to 3 days.

182
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,120
I am sorry.

183
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,670
Even if I had shown it to you, that would not have changed the speed of the ship.

184
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,290
I thought that would cause you just more stress, therefore I hid it.

185
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,550
You include/understand, Luffy?

186
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,130
I have the impression that the things are badly.

187
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,010
Well, you include/understand better than I believed it.

188
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,390
But if one quickly does not take you along to a doctor…

189
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,520
I am well. The thermometer is just broken.

190
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,140
Nobody can have a body temperature of 40°C.

191
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,600
It is probably right a heat stroke.

192
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,900
I do not need a doctor.
Ca from will go away all alone.

193
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,320
We as envisaged direct right on Arabasta.

194
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,370
Thank you to be to you worried.

195
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,420
Is Oh, it cured?

196
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,830
Cretin, it makes pretense of being well.

197
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,470
This rate/rhythm, blood soon will run in this country.

198
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,650
Ca will become a war!

199
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,520
If I do not stop that, Arabasta will disappear!

200
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,150
Crocodile will obtain the throne!

201
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,320
To arrive over there alive is not sufficient any more now!

202
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,410
I must arrive there as quickly as possible!

203
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,660
If I do not arrive there in time, 1.000.000 of the miens will engage a meaningless battle!

204
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,290
There are 1.000.000 people?

205
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,790
Which terrible burden for you, Vivi-Chan.

206
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,640
What did you foutais?

207
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,600
It is what your problem?

208
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,520
The boat goes straight.

209
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,480
Straight in the bad direction!

210
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,030
Look at the compass, instead of brailler!

211
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,490
I do not have to look at this thing.

212
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,820
We followed the direction of this large cloud since the beginning.

213
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,360
Do the clouds move and change form, not?

214
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,280
I cannot any more support it, I have a headache.

215
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,620
Then file to rest to you and lets make me!

216
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,660
I left because I knew that I could not trust you!

217
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,670
The air changes…

218
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,790
Air?

219
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,760
The weather was nice all during the day.

220
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,590
Call everyone outside!

221
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,050
He! Bring your buttocks on the bridge!

222
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,010
Y' has job!

223
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,760
What?

224
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,720
What?

225
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,730
I do not like to receive orders of your share.

226
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,850
The farm and work!

227
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,230
Incline the veils so that ground wind is caught.

228
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,270
What occurs, Nami-San?

229
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,730
There are no waves and time is clear.

230
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,150
Wind…

231
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,200
Wind?

232
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,780
A high wind will strike us.

233
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,120
I think…

234
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,700
What?

235
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,540
Heat!

236
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,810
Be extreme for you!

237
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,690
One must stop the ship and seek you a doctor!

238
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,250
Deal with your business!

239
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,010
It is my normal temperature!

240
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,130
Stop making the idiot and draws on the cords!

241
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,010
Nami-San, I know that it is for the good of Vivi-Chan and all, but…

242
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,590
You should not tire you like that.

243
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,680
I said to you that I was well!

244
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,060
He Nami, you really go…

245
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,940
I don't care! Move the boat!

246
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,700
What arrives on us?

247
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,580
Ca does not resemble a storm.

248
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,280
I must arrive at Arabasta as quickly as possible.

249
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,750
I have a request, you others.

250
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,460
I realize how much it is be likely for you to have me on board but…

251
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,760
Now, my country runs towards a horrible destiny.

252
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,800
At all events, I want that we advance!

253
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,880
I will not be able to support the least delay!

254
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,430
I require that the boat continues right on Arabasta at maximum speed!

255
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,310
Of course.

256
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,690
We, isn't this promised?

257
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,660
Well, now, let us find an island with a doctor!

258
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,040
We must look after Nami-San as possible as quickly and direct us towards Arabasta!

259
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,790
It is that the “maximum speed” of this boat?

260
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,500
Ouais!

261
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,500
It cannot go more quickly!

262
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,800
You are sure?

263
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,260
As do a princess, you have to deal with million subjects, not?

264
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,550
It is that!

265
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,600
It is for that one must look after Nami-San as fast as possible!

266
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,220
Well considering, Vivi-Chan!

267
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,100
I am even in love!

268
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,980
She is couillue!

269
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,520
I am sorry.

270
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,190
Do not tire yourself, please Nami-San.

271
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,200
Excuse me… Vivi…

272
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,240
I believe that I will be a weight here…

273
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,830
Nami-San, hold good!

274
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,200
Ouahou! What is it that?

275
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,120
It is a cyclone!

276
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,420
It is enormous!!!

277
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,790
Wait a little!

278
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,040
This direction it is…

279
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,000
The same one towards which we went before!

280
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,720
If we had continued, we would have been pulverized!

281
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,020
It was not far!!

282
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,270
We missed little!!

283
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,560
Impressing…

284
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,860
The cyclones on Grand Line are almost impossible to predict.

285
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,780
And it has…

286
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,860
It is not based solely on the theory to predict time.

287
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,200
It is more as if it could feel itself time.

288
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,200
I never saw such a navigator…

289
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,500
Well! Now, one moves!

290
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,460
Let us find a doctor!

291
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,590
YES!

292
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,440
Will Vivi-Chan, what one make?

293
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,940
The fever of Nami-San will not drop!

294
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,940
Sanji-San! Karu!

295
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,530
I said to you to be held quiet!

296
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you see a doctor?

297
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,790
How if it could see a doctor, moron!

298
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,210
He, the guy!

299
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,590
You believe that one can hold upright on the ocean?

300
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,720
You want to know if people can hold upright on the ocean?

301
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,760
Do Zoro, about what you speak?

302
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,810
Then, what is it that?

303
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,020
What, what?

304
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,280
Of what, that?

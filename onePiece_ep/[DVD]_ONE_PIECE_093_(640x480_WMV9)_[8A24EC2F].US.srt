1
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,240
Kingdom of Arabasta. Nanohana

2
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
City

3
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:21,590
Katorea

4
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,170
Arrival with the kingdom of the desert!

5
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,170
The creative powder of rain and the army rebel

6
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,050
We almost arrived.

7
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,060
Would not be too impatient.

8
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,860
But I imagine that it is stronger than you.

9
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,470
Will you have enough men to stop the rebellion?

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
One will make with what one A.

11
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,860
But nothing says that will bring peace.

12
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,000
I have if hunger.

13
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,250
I am so hot.

14
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,160
Please, made not madnesses…

15
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,420
It is thus with that a town of Arabasta resembles.

16
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,920
To eat!

17
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,170
Listen to all, I will not repeat it.

18
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,710
I await to you an exemplary behavior in all circumstances.

19
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,970
Yes, Nami-San!

20
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,080
That which should listen to that has already foutu the camp

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,580
TO EAT!!

22
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,030
HEY! RETURN!

23
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,860
It is not normal.

24
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,030
What will we make?

25
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,360
No concern.

26
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,180
It is enough to go where there is grabuge,

27
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,520
it is there that it will be.

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,580
It rightly, you knows.

29
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,530
Good blood.

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,230
I hope that he remembers that its head is put at price.

31
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,560
Especially in such a large country.

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,740
Let us let do it, it will not have a problem.

33
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,220
Rather let us eat.

34
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,790
One will think of that later.

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,560
Not to repurchase the other!

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,320
Karu and me let us not can follow you.

37
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,350
Why? You have the disturbed stomach?

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,750
Too many people can recognize me here.

39
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,840
It rightly.

40
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,250
No the problem.

41
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,300
I will pay to you to eat, Vivi-Chan!

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,970
What is there?

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,990
The boat of Mr. 3!

44
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,060
One had not regulated his account to him, with this dumb?

45
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,100
It is well it his.

46
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,980
If I remember well, this boat functions thanks to the capacities of Doru Doru Fruit.

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,070
It is thus well there.

48
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,320
Ca feels the troubles.

49
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,280
We are likely to be recognized.

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,950
Ca will go. I have a plan.

51
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,130
Thus, they will be unable to say where we are.

52
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,090
And we can move without us to show.

53
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,440
I think that we are even more visible.

54
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,240
Yosh! They is good, the way is free.

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,300
One already realized some.

56
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,860
It would be said that nobody noticed us.

57
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,830
Ca, it would be a miracle.

58
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,140
Vivi-Chan, you will be here with the shelter of the inquisitive eyes, for the moment.

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,660
Vivi-Chan?

60
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,450
Yes?

61
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,850
Yes, yes, what is it?

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,580
What doesn't go?

63
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,080
I am sorry.

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,930
I thought just that…

65
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,500
At least, when I look at the city, all still seems to be well.

66
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,630
And yet, I cannot have the mind at ease…

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,700
But I think that it still can…

68
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
… to be saved.

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,970
It is true, it has all the air of a peaceful city.

70
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,100
He, Vivi.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,820
You said well that you were able to stop the rebellion, not?

72
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,910
Which is the following stage?

73
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,010
What do we have to make?

74
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,860
If we can still stop them,

75
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,620
we would make well act.

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
Yes, it is true…

77
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,200
But simply promised you to me to be led to Arabasta and…

78
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,020
Enough! I do not manage to believe that you still think like that.

79
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,790
Nami-San!

80
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,890
One sailed together up to now,

81
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,820
and you believe that one will release to you now?

82
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,170
It is true, Vivi.

83
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
One will not give up to you now.

84
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,830
And I am interested enough by this Shichibukai.

85
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,780
, That is enough for you with that!

86
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,770
In any case, cease to have similar thoughts.

87
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,980
And of course, everyone is sought, except me.

88
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,900
Sanji-San.

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,760
It is like that.

90
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,820
Moreover, if this country is destroyed, I will never be paid to have brought you here. Included/understood?

91
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,590
O-oui!

92
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,030
Well, you seized.

93
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,280
You merits of going in hell.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,680
Thank you Zoro.

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,550
I did not forget your debt either.

96
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,320
You…

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,070
I will recover my money even if I am a phantom.

98
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,340
Argh, dirtiness!

99
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,370
You owe me 400.000 exactly Berry!

100
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,500
You increased ace!

101
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,190
If you do not refund me soon, that will increase even more!

102
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,250
Euh… Usopp, you can…

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,010
Thank you.

104
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,200
Not.

105
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
Nami-San is in its right!

106
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,790
WHAT!?

107
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,700
In the North-West, there is an oasis called Yuba.

108
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,090
It is the base of the rebels.

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,580
To stop the rebellion, it is initially necessary to go over there.

110
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,060
But to go to Yuba, the desert should be crossed.

111
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,740
We must thus gather here water and the vivres necessary, but…

112
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,320
If Mr. 3 is downtown…

113
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,160
Oh, if there is only that, that will go.

114
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,300
It me forever considering.

115
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,360
It is true. Sanji-Kun forever met this moron.

116
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,460
And there is another of them.

117
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,710
Yes, there is also Chopper.

118
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,440
Perfect.

119
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,100
There will be full with things to carry.

120
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,930
I count on you.

121
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,210
, Heard well!

122
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,920
Are Eh, sure for you?

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,270
Ca will go! I want to better do my!

124
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,500
If I am in this form, that should go, not?

125
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,150
Yosh! Be to you a guy well… finally a reindeer well!

126
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,340
Then, if you want well…

127
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,330
You can count on us.

128
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,120
It is necessary for us in priority provisions,

129
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,020
and I would like well that you take clothing too.

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,720
Clothing?

131
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,070
Yes, like those of the inhabitants, not to be made locate.

132
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh and some perfumes!

133
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,190
Yes, Nami-San!

134
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,080
Food and water.

135
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,500
Tabasco.

136
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,320
Forget that, buffoon.

137
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,100
Food and water…

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,370
Tabasco.

139
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,050
Forget that, buffoon.

140
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,630
Good, and now…

141
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,190
This idiot. Where is it and that devil can it make?

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,280
Hum, that does not resemble a place frankly where there could be a restaurant…

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,270
Ouais me and with all that…

144
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,640
I AM OR?

145
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,800
Pas le choice, is necessary that I turn over on my steps.

146
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,720
Smoke.

147
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,360
And which says smoked, known as…

148
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,130
TO EAT!

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,890
He says that it is meat of stag.

150
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,960
Completely what one can find in a country with the rich person inheritance.

151
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,270
They have a multitude of interesting dishes.

152
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,780
Does Y' have a problem, Chopper?

153
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,510
There is an odd odor mingled with that with the dishes.

154
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
An odd odor?

155
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,190
Ah, they is the scents of the perfumes.

156
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,380
Perfumes?

157
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,220
Look at, that comes from this shop.

158
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,750
I do not like much this odor.

159
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,790
HE!

160
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,500
Miss, I must acknowledge that you are delightful.

161
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,660
With this mysterious fragrance and your dazzling beauty, all the remainder becomes fuzzy.

162
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,700
Good. What would you say to take a cup of tea with me?

163
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,000
Good blood, Chopper!?
I was in right track there!

164
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,100
What do you make?
The provisioning is more important.

165
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,160
I know it!

166
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,270
Ah, I can of it more this odor!
Ca returns to me sick.

167
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,680
Go, go, does not force too much.

168
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,490
I will deal with the races,

169
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
you ace that to await me some share.

170
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,720
With more!

171
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,960
Miss!

172
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,970
Will it arrive there?

173
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
They is not good.

174
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,970
I start to have the symptoms of an insolation.

175
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,520
It is necessary that I am a place with the expenses.

176
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,630
Ah, it is pleasant.

177
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,520
I will rest here until the return of Sanji.

178
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,220
I wonder whether that will go.

179
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,780
Ca… that will surely go…

180
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,180
You closed ace?

181
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,030
Ouais, allons-y.

182
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,930
It would be awkward if one were made locate.

183
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,880
Where did it can well go?

184
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,460
Nanohana is famous for its perfumes but…

185
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,580
they in fact are manufactured in the oasis of Katorea.

186
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,430
It is in the West of the city.

187
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,390
It is what that? Ca does not even resemble a little bit a restaurant.

188
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,800
Excuse me!

189
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,820
Does Ben, y' have anybody?

190
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,410
Oh, of water!

191
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,620
Aaah it… I would have been happy even with some unhappy drops…

192
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,140
It is what that?

193
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,930
What is it that this green powder?

194
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,350
Is Ca eaten?

195
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,680
Ca does not have the very appetizing air…

196
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,320
Beurk! They is not good!

197
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,730
It is what this wretched trick?

198
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,430
It is frankly dégueu!

199
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,230
Oh, perfect!

200
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,050
This trick must be a poison!

201
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,150
You ace that to burn!

202
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,930
I lost only too much time here.

203
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,210
It is necessary that I hurry to find to eat…

204
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,440
What…!?

205
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,070
Rain.

206
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,640
Oh it is brilliant! Water!

207
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,570
Q - what occurs?

208
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,550
All the bags disappeared!

209
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,250
What you ace which been able well foutre?

210
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,650
Who are you?

211
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,240
Keep silent yourself!

212
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,740
I ask you what arrived at the powder bags which were at side!

213
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,510
Powder?

214
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,180
I did everything to burn!

215
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,540
To burn!?

216
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,740
My Dance Powder…

217
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,420
The treasure of my life…

218
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,430
Let us go, pépé, why are depressed to you?

219
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,570
Keep silent yourself!

220
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,770
How did you can dare to burn my invaluable powder!?

221
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,570
Do you know only how much it cost me!?

222
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,200
Nan!

223
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,230
Moreover, what try to you to make here?!

224
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,700
Do you realize of what you did, dumb?!

225
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,360
Return to me my dream!

226
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,480
It was your dream?

227
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,860
Yes! It was the first step towards the realization of my project!

228
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,640
I am sincerely sorry.

229
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,180
To excuse you nothing will change, return to me my money!

230
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,210
I cannot, I do not have money.

231
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,880
Do not take to me for an idiot!

232
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,090
I built this hut in this deserted place…

233
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,860
I had finally arrived from there there…

234
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,050
Go, is not necessary to take it as that.

235
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,170
You ace that to repurchase some, not?

236
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,720
Ca is not bought so easily!

237
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,420
Its production and its sale are prohibited in the whole world!

238
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,480
What, what?

239
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,090
Are Pépé, to you a criminal?

240
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,140
You bored me up to date.

241
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,440
Thus burst!

242
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,650
What? What is this…?

243
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,720
I am where?

244
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,660
Eh? Eh?!

245
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,910
It is which them?

246
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
Where?

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,570
Rifles!

248
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,500
Does Y' have a problem?

249
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,550
I believed to hear something with the back.

250
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,600
But y' has anything.

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,570
I do not know who it is but they do not have the air very nice.

252
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,910
It is necessary that I left myself quickly from there.

253
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,980
Ullage…

254
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,940
Beautiful work.

255
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,040
You are late a little.

256
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,080
Ouais, this dumb of trafficker of weapons wanted to make us pay expensive.

257
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,020
And it looked at from where we came…

258
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Nothing there can.

259
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,340
If they got information about us, one will not draw any easily.

260
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,270
Where is Kohza?

261
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,120
Inside.

262
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,600
One also took a little food.

263
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,550
It is with the back.

264
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,240
Included/understood.

265
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,750
It is what that?

266
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,420
They bought a whole stag?

267
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,340
Kohza, we have arm.

268
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,290
Not much however.

269
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,410
It is already that, it was a dangerous job.

270
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,400
It is nothing.

271
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,210
What do you have? Why you remainders there?

272
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,580
This country… became insane.

273
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,330
This rate/rhythm, we will be the first to disappear.

274
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,290
Or…

275
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
In any case, peace will not last.

276
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,020
Since we, the 300.000 royal guards… naps come to help you, you have enough men.

277
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,560
But we do not have enough weapons.

278
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,810
Nor enough of vivres besides.

279
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,830
Our manpower reached its limits.

280
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,510
To pour still a little more blood will not change anything.

281
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,860
Our next attack will put a term at all that.

282
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,800
We, the rebellious army, will transform this country.

283
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,930
Was Hey, there no meat with the back?

284
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,760
Somebody of it is undoubtedly already charged.

285
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,540
It will be necessary that I check that.

286
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,300
What?

287
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,900
Water?

288
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,940
You ace that with drinking what there is in the bucket over there.

289
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,490
He, still a voyage and they will be good!

290
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,510
Give me a knack!

291
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,470
Ca goes!

292
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,390
Is L it way free?

293
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,000
You saved me!

294
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,270
Thank you!

295
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,680
But why did you save me?

296
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,860
“For the fun; does that give me the cool air, not?”

297
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,830
Be odd for you you, hein?

298
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,740
Thank you very much!

299
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,520
A little odd but a nice bloke.

300
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,220
I have the feeling which one will be re-examined.

301
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,800
But which was these men?

302
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,720
Good it, of which Nanohana east coast is not all?

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,880
Beuh, it is on this side.

304
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,420
Be really strong for you.

305
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,840
Nobody can beat me.

306
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,500
I want to believe well, with such a power.

307
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,800
I excuse myself sincerely.

308
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,230
Not, not, not, not, on the contrary.

309
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,490
It is me which am sorry to have burned something of also important.

310
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,300
Oh not, not. We are wrong both.

311
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,160
But, more important, does not speak with anybody about this powder, please.

312
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,870
He.

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,950
It is what this powder with the Juste?

314
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,520
T you do not know?

315
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,740
Not, that has a dreadful taste.

316
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,790
Then, you see, it acts of Dance Powder.

317
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,910
Dance Powder?

318
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,820
One also invites it “Powder-Which-Fact-To rain”.

319
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,500
The downpour of presently was caused by Dance Powder.

320
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,950
Do you want explanations detailed?

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,270
Even if you gave some to me, I would not include/understand.

322
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,780
It is well the impression which you give.

323
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,960
Do not take to me for an idiot!

324
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,360
Good then, this powder makes it possible to create rain artificially.

325
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,190
I.e.…

326
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,710
Dance Powder synthesizes…

327
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,280
… of the crystals of rain present in all the atmosphere…

328
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,240
… that the core is called…

329
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,490
… in which accumulate the water droplets…

330
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,080
… and when there is enough…

331
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,640
… of the clouds are formed…

332
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,200
… and it rains!

333
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
You ace very seized?

334
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,090
Good, it is a magic powder, what.

335
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,110
Splendid, it included/understood!

336
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,830
Do really not be sympathetic for you.

337
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,550
And why use this powder to make rain?

338
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,830
My word, but you do not know really anything of this country.

339
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,840
Ouais, my boat has just dropped anchor.

340
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,310
The country of Arabasta fought against the dryness since old times.

341
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,310
The dryness?

342
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,960
It is when it does not rain and that the ground is desiccated.

343
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,310
I know it, that!

344
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,310
This country thus always was in chronic lack of water.

345
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,260
And especially these last years, where there were only weak precipitations.

346
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,250
It is rather odd.

347
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,790
The majority of the oases start to be desiccated.

348
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,830
Why not use this magic powder then?

349
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,230
Completely!

350
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,730
But Dance Powder is prohibited by the World Government.

351
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,460
If he discovers that you use some, you are carried out.

352
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,120
They also say that the rebellion of this country is due to the dryness.

353
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,160
Really?

354
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,940
You know really anything, hein?

355
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,110
Then pépé, your dream is to save this country with this magic powder?

356
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,170
You said well that they was invaluable for you, not?

357
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,990
Eh well, not… I had not thought of something of as well.

358
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,860
Then what?

359
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,780
Ben, in such circumstances, if you can create water, you can make large benefit.

360
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,240
Hey, you ace reason! You are malignant sacrament, you!

361
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,140
Good, at all events, that has nothing to do with me.

362
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,340
Will be necessary that I recover in search from food.

363
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,220
Hum, please, does not speak with anybody about all that.

364
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,430
Ouais, ouais, releases me with that.

365
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,440
Please!

366
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,790
I will give you all that I can!

367
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,850
Really?

368
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,890
Really, really.

369
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,340
He, thank you for the package.

370
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,930
Afflicted to take your lunch to you, pépé.

371
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,280
Oh, if it is all that you want…

372
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,750
Yes, yes, they is good.

373
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,360
With more, pépé!

374
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,720
Do not forget, please!

375
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,490
Worry you, worries you!

376
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,050
I would speak about it in vain, nobody would not believe in it.

377
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,550
Because I am a pirate!

378
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,700
Bye!

379
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,680
Thank you for the meal!

380
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,950
Oh, it is unjust!

381
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,190
Ah, it is splendid!

382
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,110
I adore this kind of clothing.

383
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,870
In connection with the races which you were charged to make, Sanji-San…

384
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,470
Wouldn't this be… behaviors of dancers?

385
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,750
Adorable, not? It suits you so well!

386
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,560
But I asked you for clothing as those which people carry here.

387
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,050
Eh well, there are also dancers!

388
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,630
But to go in the desert…

389
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,270
Do not worry you! If you are tired, I will carry you!

390
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,410
As much to speak with a deaf person.

391
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,900
But you know… compared to the girls,

392
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,310
you always resemble a pair of robbers!

393
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,890
You looked at yourself?

394
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,220
Do Chopper, what you make?

395
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,420
I try to stop me the nose.

396
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,120
Did Ah yes, to the fact, suit you where?

397
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,920
Here and there.

398
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,100
It is sick?

399
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,170
Oh, it is right which it does not support the perfumes.

400
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,620
Perfumes?

401
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,610
Of course, the nose of Tony-Kun is very sensitive.

402
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,460
Ah, you find.

403
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,980
Certain scents are very strong.

404
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,300
Like this one?

405
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,980
Ah, stops that.

406
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,070
Ah, I fall in your feet, my “Mellorine Love”.

407
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,070
Mellorine is a frozen dessert

408
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,030
It is that, and remainders there.

409
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,510
In any case, it seems that all the desired material is had…

410
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,340
… to achieve our goal, isn't this?

411
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:35,880
Yes.

412
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,380
You said well that our destination is Yuba, hein?

413
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,300
Yes, it is that.

414
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,050
But to reach it, the desert should be crossed.

415
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,460
It will be a voyage much more frightening than all than you can imagine.

416
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,900
You never know what can arrive.

417
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,080
A false step and nothing guarantee to you that you will remain in life…

418
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,520
… in this frightening desert.

419
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,880
I have always scruples to involve you in such an adventure, but…

420
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,940
… I want to bring back peace in this country.

421
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,430
Then…

422
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,760
Then, I would like to still ask you something.

423
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,480
You all! Lend to me all your forces, please!

424
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,100
Please…!

425
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,630
You finally said it.

426
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,950
Only that was awaited.

427
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,070
Not to know what will arrive, it is like sailing, not Vivi-Chan?

428
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,980
Ouais, nothing again what.

429
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,100
I am in a hurry to see the desert.

430
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,320
Well, the guy!

431
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,300
Tops the hearts, one leaves for Yuba!

432
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,500
Ouais!

433
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,260
Friends…

434
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,070
One forgets nobody, there?

435
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,350
LUFFY!

436
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,050
It was not very nutritive.

437
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,260
This moron of first.

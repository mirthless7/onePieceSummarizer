1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,080
Two days and nights and it's starting to bubble.

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,200
Nami-san, Robin-chan, just wait 'til you see this! 

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,080
My Special Breakfast!

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:17,840
Inherited recipe!
Sanji, the curry expert

24
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,930
Damn, this fog is as thick as milk. I can't see a thing!

25
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,810
Luffy, see anything?

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,930
Oi, I think I can make something out!

27
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,600
Look out!

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,250
There's a huge ship dead-ahead!

29
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,020
Sanji-kun, the helm! Turn us hard to starboard!

30
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,150
Right away, Nami-san~! 

31
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,110
Sanji's Special Love- Oh!

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,050
T-This is bad!

33
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,030
We're gonna be surrounded by Marines!

34
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,550
AWESOME!

35
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,980
Even the Marines won't be able to see anything in mist thick.

36
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,950
We should try to blend in and make our escape.

37
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,090
Right.

38
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,700
Keep moving forward!

39
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,350
And everyone keep quiet.

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,200
Especially you, Luffy.

41
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,910
Got it!

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,030
Nami-san.

43
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,910
Wait a moment...

44
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,150
A kid?

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,870
What's he doing?

46
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,910
Watch out!

47
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,980
Leave it to me!

48
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,880
He'll be alright.

49
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,800
It look like the restorative worked.

50
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,320
Where am I?

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,980
You're aboard the ship of the Luffy Pirates.

52
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,530
P-Pirates!?

53
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,330
Yeah.

54
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,540
Don't you remember?

55
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,390
You fell off your warship.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,080
Stay back!

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,690
You're planning on attacking the Marine warships, aren't you!?

58
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,000
What's up with this kid? After we just saved his ass.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Well, he is a little Marine.

60
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,370
First you need to eat.

61
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,210
Take it away.

62
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,160
I don't need pirates to take care of me.

63
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,250
So you won't eat a soup made by the cook of a pirate ship.

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,570
It's not like I'm gonna poison it.

65
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,350
Just put a little of that in your stomach and you'll feel better.

66
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,120
This soup is magnificent!

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,900
It's crystal clear and there's no sediment in the bottom.

68
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,870
Thank you.

69
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,500
Sure, you're very welcome.

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,650
I'm Tajiyo, a Marine trainee cook.

71
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm Sanji.

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,990
Oh, so you're a cook?

73
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,090
Sanji-san, you're wasting your time cooking aboard this poor little pirates ship!

74
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,620
Your skills are exquisite!

75
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,840
What'd you say!?

76
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,860
This ain't no poor little ship!

77
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,320
That's right! This ship is from my very own Syrup Village-

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,260
Can you eat it then?

79
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,330
No, not that kind of syrup!

80
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,890
A girl named Kaya gave it to us- and then you call it just some poor pirate ship!?

81
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,890
Okay, okay, okay! Calm down already!

82
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,460
The truth is... I...

83
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,430
...spilled the curry for today's lunch.

84
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm very sorry!

85
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,970
Make some more.

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,750
You spilled it, right?

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:53,120
If you're really sorry, make another batch of curry before lunch.

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,490
That chef's right, no doubt about that.

89
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,060
I've tried so many times...

90
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,740
But I've never been able to get it right.

91
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,070
Tajiyo-kun, how long have you been a cook?

92
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,940
I've been a trainee cook for only half a year.

93
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,540
Half a year is more than enough.

94
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,910
No it's not!

95
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,380
Ever day, all I get to do is wash dishes and peel vegetables!

96
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,480
I've never actually cooked anything before!

97
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,190
And the thing is...

98
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,390
Once a week, all the fleet Captains gather to eat curry.

99
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,550
The time, the ship I'm on is in charge of making the curry!

100
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,740
My curry would never be good enough for the Marine brass.

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,850
Marine Curry is quite a famous dish.

102
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,310
Every chef uses their own skills and culture to create a curry for their ship.

103
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,820
Hey, sounds tasty!

104
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,620
You've been a trainee cook for half a year, but haven't buit any confidence in yourself.

105
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,160
Just go back and apologize to your chef again.

106
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,150
No!

107
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,340
If I do that, I'll have to leave the ship!

108
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,440
Does it have to be that ship?

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,300
Is there a specific reason?

110
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,360
Well...

111
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,970
All...

112
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,170
Have you heard of All Blue?

113
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,840
East Blue, West Blue, South Blue, North Blue...

114
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,250
It's a sea where the fish from all the other oceans swim together!

115
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,490
For cooks, it's a sea of treasure they would risk their lives to see just once!

116
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,300
The senior cooks call it a dream and always laugh at me.

117
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,470
But I believe!

118
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,010
All Blue does exist!

119
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,180
Staying aboard a Marine ship gives me a better chance of finding it, right?

120
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,240
That's why...

121
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,760
That's why I don't want to leave the ship.

122
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,770
Wasn't All Blue...

123
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,460
We really should get away from here as fast as we can, but...

124
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,390
Yeah, if they find us, they're gonna start firing.

125
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,220
But since he's so determined, we have to take him back, right?

126
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,610
Sanji-kun?

127
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm only going to take him back to the ship.

128
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,700
Oi Luffy, lend me a hand.

129
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,990
GOMU GOMU NO TOMOZUNA!

130
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,990
Ship-to-ship line

131
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,720
Oi, Sanji! I got it.

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
The mist will burn off by noon.

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
It'll get pretty risky after that, so we can't wait any longer.

134
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,370
That's enough.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,140
How much do you plan on helping him?

136
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm just curious about Marine culinary styles.

137
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,170
Sanji!

138
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,900
Yeah!

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,160
Yosh!

140
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,630
Hold on tight!

141
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,440
Why the hell did you have to come along?

142
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,420
How would you get back if I didn't?

143
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,570
Fine, but stay right here and don't make a sound!

144
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,560
O-Okay.

145
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,750
No. 18 Fleet Kitchen

146
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,100
This is the kitchen.

147
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,440
Yeah, this'll cover your return trip fee.

148
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,010
Let's take a look around.

149
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,530
Just like the Marines to go all out like this.

150
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,790
Everything's real high quality.

151
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,380
What was that?

152
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,180
It's from the pantry!

153
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,240
Man, that scared me.

154
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,130
Luffy!

155
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,670
What are you doing here!?

156
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,760
Sanji!

157
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,530
I was just exploring! Exploring!

158
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,500
This is a rare opportunity, right?

159
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,350
Now I'm off to explore some more!

160
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,800
Do whatever you like.

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,670
But if the Marines get hold of you, I ain't coming to save you.

162
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,400
And one more thing. Leave the stuff in your pants behind.

163
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,140
The apples.

164
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,300
This is the Marine Curry.

165
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,890
When I was on the floating restaurant...

166
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,020
Owner Zeff never taught me anything.

167
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,610
Day after day, he made me wash the dishes.

168
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,350
Oi, little eggpiant.

169
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,330
You won't get anywhere just by working hard.

170
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,820
Why do you think I allow you in my kitchen taking you under my wing for over half a year?

171
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,940
Use that head of yours and think!

172
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,620
Zeff said that to me every time I complained.

173
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,490
Oh, so the chef was letting me observe his cooking skills.

174
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,050
You can't teach cooking.

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,940
Sanji-san!

176
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,460
I'm going to try!

177
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,140
Uh...

178
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,700
What did the chef say!?

179
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,360
The curry recipe is all about the powder, the sauce, and its ingredients.

180
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,400
There are many different blends of curry powder.

181
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,640
The aroma is still fresh.

182
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,800
After completing the curry, he must have added some Garam Masala.

183
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,800
Garam Masala - Special blend of spices used in South Asia

184
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,540
Don't be lazy and use a ready-made spice!

185
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,720
It loses the quality of its aroma!

186
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,790
Garam Masala!

187
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,400
He sure has the nose.

188
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,420
It's huge!

189
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,140
With this mist...

190
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,790
We won't be able to move for a bit.

191
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,100
It'll probably clear up by lunchtime.

192
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,360
By the way, did you hear about today's lunch?

193
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,410
Yeah, that trainee cook Tajiyo is gonna make it.

194
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,300
I wonder what kind of food he'll give us.

195
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,550
Yeah, I wonder!

196
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,540
For the stock, I'll use a ready-made one.

197
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,610
Now to prepare the ingredients.

198
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,900
First, I have to carve and cook the meat.

199
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,820
The essence of making beef curry is keeping the taste of the meat locked in the beef itself.

200
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:21,340
But in this curry, the taste of the meat is spread throughout the curry sauce.

201
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,090
Meaning...

202
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,430
The kid is already messing up.

203
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,180
Is something wrong?

204
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,930
Hey kid, food isn't supposed to be made in a hurry.

205
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,310
Listen up.

206
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,440
In cooking, the main ingredient's taste is crucial.

207
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,360
Take your time preparing it. It will affect everything else.

208
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,030
Garlic.

209
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,790
Ginger.

210
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,860
A dash of turmeric.

211
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,570
And some yogurt.

212
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,990
All the ingredients are ready.

213
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,620
Next, I have to stir-fry the onion.

214
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,880
Smoking in a cooking area!?

215
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,180
How can a cook even think of doing that!?

216
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,700
I might've said that you were too good to be a pirate cook,

217
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,180
But I take that back!

218
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,090
Uh-oh.

219
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,950
I singed my hair.

220
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,490
Listen, you have to stir-fry the onions.

221
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,990
Keep stirring so they won't burn!

222
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,810
When they've softened, lower the heat.

223
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,590
Then continue stirring slowly until they turn golden brown.

224
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,110
Got it guys?

225
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,480
Sanji-san...

226
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,870
...was reminding me about the heat.

227
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,300
Whoa, this is high!

228
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,450
The view's a lot different from up here.

229
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,540
Who the hell are you!?

230
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,610
Ah, I've been spotted!

231
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,800
WAIT!

232
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,580
Like hell I'm gonna wait!

233
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,380
First, melt some Ghee butter.

234
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,640
Add some flour.

235
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,290
Stir gently so it doesn't burn.

236
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,070
Add the curry powder.

237
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,140
Then add Garam Masala to enhance its aroma.

238
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,540
Then combine them all.

239
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,420
Pour in the stock.

240
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,390
Tomatoes.

241
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,790
Add the onions.

242
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,470
Then the marinated meat.

243
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,860
No!

244
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,820
It doesn't have any taste!

245
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,440
I knew it! I'm not good enough!

246
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,180
The secret ingredient!

247
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,040
Sanji-san!

248
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,160
Damn.

249
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,340
This apple's sweet.

250
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,660
Sanji-san!

251
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,470
Thank you very much.

252
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,190
What're you talking about?

253
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,640
I haven't done anything to be thanked for.

254
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,560
Sanji-san, you pretended to do things to bother me,

255
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,870
But you were actually giving me advice!

256
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't get the wrong idea.

257
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,220
Down there!

258
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,870
He ran that way!

259
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,940
Sanji!

260
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,640
We're leaving!

261
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,210
That idiot.

262
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,930
After him!

263
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,060
GOMU GOMU NO TOMOZUNA!

264
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,160
Yosh!

265
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,370
I got it!

266
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,130
Tajiyo.

267
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,000
I think it exists too.

268
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,660
All Blue!

269
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,210
Sanji! Grab hold!

270
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,500
Hey Tajiyo, an intruder just came this way.

271
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,560
Which way did he go?

272
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,140
Eh? I didn't see anyone.

273
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,410
Maybe you were imagining things.

274
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,530
Keep searching!

275
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,740
He must be somewhere on this ship!

276
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,130
Keep searching!

277
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,470
Bastard...

278
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,350
You got some kind of grudge against me?

279
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,680
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,220
That face doesn't look like it's sorry.

281
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,770
I'm saying I'm sorry.

282
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,170
I'll kick you off this ship, jackass...

283
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,750
What's wrong, Luffy?

284
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,040
Ah! You damaged the Going Merry again!

285
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,300
Oh, Usopp, Nami, sorry.

286
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,010
I got spotted by the Marines, so we had to rush back.

287
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,780
WHAT!?

288
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,070
W-Wait, what do you mean by that!?

289
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,460
This ship was a gift from Kaya!

290
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,730
How many times do I have to tell you that!?

291
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,740
We have to get going!

292
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,990
Usopp, Sanji-kun! Let's set sail!

293
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,420
Right away, Nami-san! 

294
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,960
My body won't move...

295
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Set the places.

296
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,220
Yes, Sir!

297
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,670
Now, please help yourselves.

298
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,870
Oh, this is pretty good.

299
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,180
The spice's aroma is spreading through my mouth!

300
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,580
And this meat is so tender!

301
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,550
Seconds, please!

302
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,610
Tajiyo.

303
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,130
Yes, Chef.

304
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,630
Don't forget to wash the dishes later.

305
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,450
Aye, Sir.

306
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,380
Sanji-san...

307
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,730
I think it exists too.

308
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,220
All Blue!

309
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,460
I'll never give up!

310
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,470
And someday, I'll be an even better cook than you!

311
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:02,740
Ah, as I look beyond the endless sky

312
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:13,330
I begin to imagine a tomorrow that I'll have some day

313
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,640
There were days when I feel like I'd lose to myself

314
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:37,070
But there was a warm place I could always go

315
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:43,180
People I could be proud of were always there

316
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:54,120
Placing hands upon my back and pushing me onwards

317
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:02,680
Ah, the stars are streaming down beneath the sky

318
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,800
This only happens once...

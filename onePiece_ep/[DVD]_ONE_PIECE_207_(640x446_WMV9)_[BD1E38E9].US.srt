1
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:13,925
LONGRING LONGLAND!
THE GREAT ADVENTURE

2
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,125
One moves in the right direction? Nami-san.

3
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:34,890
Obviously!

4
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:37,258
You are marvellous Nami-swan!

5
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,657
The last small effort and one will have very repaired.

6
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,490
I suspected it well…

7
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:51,524
Fortunately I bought
nails, in the old man of the dock.

8
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,090
I had a good intuition.

9
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,225
Ensure you Ussop!

10
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,458
With force I took the practice to anticipate
this kind of nuisance.

11
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:05,158
Ah! Fire disappeared!

12
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:06,825
Y' has more fuel.

13
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,257
Hey, Ussop!

14
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,891
One will land!

15
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:13,057
Hurry Chopper! And brings back
all the matos which I left.

16
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,325
Euh… included/understood well!

17
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,024
Still an effort… the octopus montgolfier!

18
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,458
Be stupid for you?! Prepare one
will have to land in urgency!

19
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:26,825
More quickly, more quickly…

20
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,425
One has…

21
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,658
One survived!

22
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,725
Do not fear anything with that you will not feel any pain.

23
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,991
Thanks to you one arrived there, one owes you
a proud candle my old man!

24
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:55,691
Thank you.

25
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:59,424
Pay attention to you!

26
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:02,324
You will not be forgotten my friend!

27
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,289
Hurry to grow!

28
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,890
The octopuses of Large Line are
much more imposing than you!

29
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,290
Goodbye! Ingredient of first choice.

30
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,925
Thank you!

31
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:11,958
Take care of you well!

32
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:17,825
Now…

33
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,957
My crew!

34
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,558
Put the right course in front of worms the next island!

35
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,957
Await a little Luffy!

36
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,357
Leave us time to put back us.

37
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:27,291
Naive, naive!

38
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,124
If it were also easy on this ocean…

39
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,191
nobody would have difficulty in sail.

40
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,825
Even you you put yourself at it.

41
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,324
Recently, the waves have the odd air.

42
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:38,557
Go, with the job the guy! Rudder with port side all!

43
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,858
With your orders! Nami-swaan!

44
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,858
You saw that?

45
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:55,657
Do something, Sanji!

46
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:56,824
They is dangerous!

47
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,925
It would be said that it y' has something inside the waves!

48
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,558
I will die!!

49
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,357
That it arrives to you?! It is due to what all this din?!

50
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,858
You bar!

51
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,724
Do not push me! I can nothing make!

52
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:17,525
Then why our friends fight do?

53
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:31,190
Bellamy?!

54
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:32,490
Sarquiss?!

55
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,691
Please stop them!

56
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,124
Please…

57
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,058
Stop that!

58
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,358
Why that is done?

59
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,090
What occurs?!

60
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,490
Sarquiss with the air really badly.

61
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,891
Why?

62
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:47,858
You want to know why?

63
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:49,558
Sarquiss.

64
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:51,125
Bellamy.

65
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,224
Because you soiled my emblem!

66
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:57,058
Here is reason.

67
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,958
Perhaps that the celestial islands exist or perhaps not.

68
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:06,225
Or that the gold city is only one vulgar myth.

69
00:06:08,491 --> 00:06:11,291
Ca does not have any importance.

70
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,358
You always have the same opinions of the others.

71
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,657
Isn't this?

72
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:19,758
Bellamy?

73
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:24,691
Donquihote Doflamingo!

74
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,990
They is members of Shichibukai!
[Shichibukai:7 Captains Corsairs]

75
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:29,557
In time, it was worth more than 300 million berrys!

76
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,624
What does such a personality make here?

77
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,957
Within my subordinates, I do not have
not need for small strike.

78
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,791
Washout!

79
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,490
Make shit!

80
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,057
I do not manage any more to control my body!

81
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:41,090
Please stops!

82
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,191
Forgive us!

83
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:46,258
Nannnnnnn!

84
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,958
Bellamy!

85
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:57,225
Last once…

86
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:01,425
Last once leaves us a chance.

87
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,824
I, not… we will follow your orders!

88
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,757
Bellamy!

89
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,925
Ca is enough Bellamy!

90
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,924
Even if I lost,

91
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:14,557
I never contradicted your ideas!

92
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:16,257
I respect your emblem!

93
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:19,057
It is right my way of doing the things!

94
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:21,390
To destroy all these poor wretches réveurs.

95
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:24,925
and a day I would be in your place.

96
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,490
My expensive and obeying subordinate.

97
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,491
You will make me cry.

98
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,657
Bellamy…

99
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,758
It is that which I like in you.

100
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,290
The new era is very close.

101
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,458
You are free to do what you want.

102
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:43,458
However.

103
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,891
I do not need more you at my sides.

104
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:51,691
Doflamingo!!

105
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,624
This gangster of 55 million berrys,
corrected like a kid. Bellamy!

106
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,658
I do not manage to believe in it.

107
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,090
The horror will begin!

108
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,390
Dispatch you to prepare you!

109
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:12,058
For a world where only pirates
strongest will survive!

110
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,457
The weak ones will have to flee!

111
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,357
Those which will not manage to follow this
vagueness will perish with their doubts!

112
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:20,691
A new era will be born!

113
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,024
It would be said that was calmed.

114
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,024
One cannot slacken his attention by here.

115
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,890
Emergency report/ratio!

116
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:52,057
Ship in sight at 12 noon!

117
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,557
What? It is an enemy?

118
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,391
Not now?!

119
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,157
Eh well.

120
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,857
They do not have a flag nor of veils.

121
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,590
Funny of boat, There are no initials.

122
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:03,257
What do you say? They do not have any decoration?!

123
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,124
What they make at sea?!

124
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,590
I know anything of it!

125
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,291
But most equivocal…

126
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,525
its crew is very reduced…

127
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:12,757
And… Hein!

128
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:14,924
They do all of the odd super mines!

129
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:17,491
One with the impression which they have any more no heart in them!

130
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,690
Flee!!

131
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,990
They are monkeys of sea!

132
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,757
Still them!

133
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,090
This time, they are much more numerous!

134
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,557
Miss pot does not have there wind!

135
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,690
Hoist the sail!

136
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,691
Veil hoisted!

137
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,057
It is what?

138
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:38,790
It fout what this ship?

139
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,390
This ship is likely to be carried if it
continue to capsize of the kind!

140
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:42,324
Hey!!

141
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,757
The guy!!

142
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:46,124
The waves and the monkeys will involve you with them!

143
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,358
Ridges half-turn!

144
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:50,390
A ship.

145
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,257
Hey!

146
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,890
It is a pirate ship!

147
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,457
You awake all!

148
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,457
There is an enemy ship! Let us steal their spoils!

149
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,590
Think already of the giant wave who precipitates towards us!

150
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:01,057
Ouais but the other ship will benefit from it to escape!

151
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,257
Prepare the gun!

152
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,357
Since when a dumb as you gives me orders?!

153
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,524
Ridges half-turn!

154
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,890
It is funny of crew…

155
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,690
They said to want to plunder our spoils.

156
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:12,557
Let us be unaware of them.

157
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:13,690
Where is the sail?

158
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:14,724
How do you want that I know it?

159
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:15,990
That somebody brings back it!

160
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,024
The navigator?

161
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,157
He is not there any more!

162
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,324
Captain!

163
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,758
HE IS NOT ANY MORE!

164
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:26,191
Who is the jerk who made use of the gun?

165
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:29,457
One will not leave oneself there unscathed!!

166
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,424
This crew is made up only of large cretins!

167
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:35,491
One is made like rats!

168
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:01,857
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

169
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:09,291
MUGIWARA-TEAM

170
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:13,291
It is the second time… that really made shit.

171
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,557
Ca with the air to be itself calmed.

172
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:19,990
I think that this tidal wave was
a joke of the monkeys of seas.

173
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:22,724
There is nothing any more to fear, time is again stable.

174
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,958
Eh well, it would be time to pose foot on a new island.

175
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,257
Hey, Robin?

176
00:11:27,258 --> 00:11:28,924
You see something?

177
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:31,091
Ca makes one moment that I see an island.

178
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:33,257
IS NECESSARY TO SAY IT THEN TO US!!

179
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,757
Without heart!

180
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:37,724
Listen! The next time that you see an island, say it to us!

181
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:38,991
Prevent the others!

182
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,124
The guy!

183
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,325
Ground right in front!

184
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,190
Maintaining in your turn!

185
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:47,990
The fog is rather thick.

186
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,824
YOU STILL HAVE FUN has TO BE UNAWARE OF Me?!

187
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:50,857
Fog…

188
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,458
Ca is likely to be dangerous.

189
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,424
Chopper!

190
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:55,057
I let you guide the boat, you of it are responsible.

191
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:55,957
Included/understood!

192
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,890
You do not realize at which point
one would have liked to see this island!

193
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,724
I am sorry.

194
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:02,191
I will pay more attention.

195
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,525
If you pay more attention, that suits me.

196
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,457
And then…

197
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,025
This boat does not worry you, the guy?

198
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,757
No the captain, not of navigator…

199
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:13,525
no the flag, nor of veils, no spirit
of team and no motivation.

200
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:16,991
I do not manage to believe that it was a crew of pirates!

201
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,057
Perhaps that they fought and that they lost.

202
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:22,357
And that the captain was killed, and that one stole all to them.

203
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:24,290
Precisely.

204
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,790
I looked at their boat well.

205
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,890
There was no sign of battle.

206
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:30,957
On each ship, it y' has objects which
represent the ideology of the pirates.

207
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,790
And on this ship there was nothing of all that.

208
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,291
Then they were not pirates.

209
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:36,891
Be not made a concern.

210
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,658
However I cannot prevent myself
to think that they are really pirates.

211
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,224
I have a bad presentiment.

212
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:45,557
You always have some.

213
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:47,690
I hope that it y' will have a city!

214
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,524
I also hope that it y' will have a shipyard!

215
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,424
Luffy!
I also hope that it y' will have a shipyard!

216
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,458
One cannot unload immediately.

217
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,625
I wonder whether one will find a good engineer naval!

218
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,524
I see the coast!

219
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,158
Prepare the anchor!

220
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:06,124
The guy… listen to me all!

221
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,291
Chopper!

222
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,958
Ussop still caught the syndrome of the '' I
donot can unload on an island unknown ''.

223
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,291
I cannot look after that!

224
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,525
Go, go, go!

225
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,858
It is what…

226
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,191
IT Y' DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING HERE!!

227
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:27,457
It is what this place?!

228
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,924
Coooool!

229
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:31,691
There is that plains as far as the eye can see!

230
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,658
It is not really very sensual like place.

231
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:38,691
I wonder well if somebody saw here.

232
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,758
YOU ALL!!

233
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,824
Ah! These types!

234
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:51,625
One knows nothing of this island and they launch out lost body there.

235
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:53,357
Ca appears quite empty.

236
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,425
I imagine that it nothing this will pass here.

237
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,858
What it y' has, Chop…

238
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:16,557
With all these hairs and this size
enormous, it is not human!

239
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:18,425
Undoubtedly it is a bear!

240
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,924
Gigantic!

241
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:24,657
This bear is bloody tall!

242
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,325
Too much large!

243
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:32,390
They is apples, they are all maiiiiigres!

244
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:33,357
DO NOT EAT CA!

245
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,125
They is delicious!

246
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,691
There are really nothing in the neighborhoods.

247
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,790
Hey! Look at!

248
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,658
It is not a house?

249
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,557
Ouais one would say.

250
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,291
I hope that somebody saw inside.

251
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,858
Let us see.

252
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:01,557
A relative with you! A relative with you!

253
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,158
I am a reindeer! HE It IS a DASH!!!

254
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:22,125
The leg!

255
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,425
Subdue to me that Chopper.

256
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,525
IMPRESSING!

257
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,425
USSOP TOO COOL EAST!

258
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:32,891
Sat!

259
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:35,791
Now make the beautiful one.

260
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:42,191
Wah, it is super length!

261
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:45,858
I manage more to see his head.

262
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:57,357
Where they still went…

263
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:59,324
They were it here y' has one moment.

264
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,957
One could do to a turn us too?

265
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,125
It could be that there is some
thing of good to be eaten by here.

266
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,124
Hey! Robin-chwan!

267
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,158
One will make a small round.

268
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:08,891
Yes!

269
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:13,857
Ca also it is looooooooooooooong.

270
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:17,890
All that is here is super length.

271
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:19,057
To only look at them…

272
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,491
I have the impression that my face stretches.

273
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:25,525
Which kind of island that can it be well?

274
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:26,990
HELLO!

275
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,090
Y' HAS SOMEBODY!

276
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,557
You cannot enter like that!

277
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:31,624
Wait, await Luffy!

278
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,157
I am ready to bet that this house
belongs to the boss of this island.

279
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:37,790
It is sûrement.un monster snake super long eater
of man or a démoniaque spirit!

280
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,025
There is nobody here…

281
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,357
Hey Luffy!

282
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,024
Ussop!

283
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:44,624
I found a giraffe!

284
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,058
WHAT?

285
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:53,790
It is not a giraffe.

286
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,857
It has a large neck but it is a horse.

287
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:56,790
A horse with a large neck.

288
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,491
Es you a horse?

289
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:01,791
What a beautiful horse!

290
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,357
It is called Shelly, it is a girl.

291
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,125
She has a saddle, it must have there somebody who saw here.

292
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,258
What doesn't go Luffy?

293
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:13,857
Ussop.

294
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,290
It is well a bamboo which pushes over there?

295
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,325
Ouais.

296
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,024
One cannot see the top!

297
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:22,025
It is so high.

298
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,091
Look at this bamboo more closely.

299
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:28,858
He flees!

300
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:32,691
Ca must still be funny of animal!

301
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,824
The bamboo attacked Luffy!

302
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:36,358
Hey! Nothing of broken?!

303
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:39,424
I will not lose against a bamboo!

304
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,358
Pay Luffy attention!

305
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:51,724
It gained!!

306
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:52,357
Ouais!!

307
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,057
I pété it into two!

308
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,825
Where is your Master?

309
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:59,591
You do not know.

310
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:01,758
You have the air quite only.

311
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,958
It is perhaps an enemy, hides by there!

312
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,891
What occurred?

313
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:15,858
Look at…

314
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,290
When I broke the bamboo…

315
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,191
a spirit appeared.

316
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,724
They wedged the way…

317
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,391
of our boat.

318
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:37,691
What do they want?

319
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,824
This ship…

320
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,724
it is that of presently.

321
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,625
Who be you?!

322
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,791
Come in bottom if you want to fight.

323
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,524
WE ARE THE PIRATE FOXY!

324
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:51,024
Do not be in a hurry! We want just…

325
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,925
A DUEL!!

326
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:56,357
A spirit?

327
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:57,124
Eh well…

328
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,525
It appeared when I broke the bamboo.

329
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,325
Hey! Said something!

330
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:07,057
Of course that I remember you.

331
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:10,658
Did Ca make one moment, what you become?

332
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,690
Do Hein, you know it the guy?

333
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:14,024
Not me.

334
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:14,924
Me either.

335
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:18,357
Ah, for this reason you were to me if not very familiar.

336
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:21,325
You do ACES SAY CA TO the CONK? AND THEN WHICH ES YOU OSSAN?

337
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:26,391
My name is Tonjit.

338
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,324
I must say to you thank you.

339
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:32,457
It is you who struck in my stilts, not truth?

340
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,025
Stilts?

341
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,958
Ah, yes it is us!

342
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:42,725
But this bamboo was so large
that I could not see the top.

343
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,124
Yes.

344
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,825
It is exactly where I was.

345
00:19:47,825 --> 00:19:50,790
You are not a spirit appeared afterwards
that I broke the bamboo.

346
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,290
You fell because I broke one of your stilts.

347
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,390
Why used you of so large stilts?

348
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:00,024
Since always I like to walk on the stilts.

349
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,224
Then I took the largest bamboos of this island.

350
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:07,457
To try to manufacture the largest stilts
world, I thought that I was going to amuse me!

351
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,790
But when I am assembled above, I had
if fear that I could not go down any more.

352
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,024
You are not a little idiot, ossan?!

353
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,525
Then I remained 10 years there.

354
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,090
YOU ES REALLY TOO IDIOT!

355
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,824
You remained on these stilts during 10 years?!

356
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:19,624
Indeed.

357
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,657
And during this time there, bamboos
continued to push.

358
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:27,058
With time Ca became even harder to go down.

359
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:29,957
Ah! It was terrifying.

360
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,290
It is all that you find to say after 10 years?!

361
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,590
Eh well here all is super large, even
perched on my stilts…

362
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:39,724
I have to find to eat, by taking them
fruits all in top of the trees.

363
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,824
It is really an incredible history.

364
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,524
That lived you during all this time.

365
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,424
While speaking about large super tricks, ossan.

366
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:49,125
Why all that is here is also gigantic, that they are the trees or the animals?

367
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:51,724
It is a normal reaction on behalf of the foreigners.

368
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,224
It y' has an obvious reason.

369
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:56,390
This island is only one vast extended from plains.

370
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:57,157
In a word…

371
00:20:57,158 --> 00:21:00,424
Everyone likes to be stretched and be released.

372
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,290
Of agreement.

373
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,257
Which explanation.

374
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:04,458
For example, look by there?

375
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:08,624
Kaaaamonoh Ashi!

376
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,324
You just lengthened the sound!

377
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:11,457
That there it is…

378
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,691
Daaaaachund!

379
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,558
It is not the dog of presently?

380
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,957
It is still there since presently?!

381
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,590
There are also dangerous animals.

382
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:21,124
Look by there.

383
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,324
He it is the léoooooooooopard snows.

384
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,325
You made not bite.

385
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:29,791
Why that one with the head lengthened on the side?!

386
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:46,791
It would not be…

387
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,091
the captain of this crew?

1
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,020
OLD ICE

2
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,980
You made certainly well comprise you a such child.

3
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,380
You betrayed your partners and be been useful to you of them like toys.

4
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,450
To survive in a medium of shadies…

5
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,730
Was single only to serve your own interests.

6
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,610
Which blow schemes you in this new team?

7
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,080
All the organizations that Nico Robin could infiltrate all were destroyed…

8
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,330
Excluded it.

9
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,470
Your companions are very courageous…

10
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,200
But you remained the same one, Nico Robin!

11
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,140
You are mistaken! I am not any more…

12
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Robin!

13
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,080
I am…

14
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,480
Robin-chan!

15
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:18,240
Rubber and of ice fights!
Luffy VS Ao Kiji

16
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,830
HE YOU!

17
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,570
Do not howl.

18
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,470
She will survive if you thaw out it delicately.

19
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,770
But its body is fragile, then would be careful.

20
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,270
She will die if she breaks.

21
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,309
For example…

22
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,140
What?!

23
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,370
If you break it like that!

24
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,380
Robin!

25
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,460
DECREE!

26
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,970
It was less one.

27
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,049
Yatta!

28
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,569
You are brilliant, Ussop!

29
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,989
It is what this brothel? He!

30
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,530
Ussop! Chopper!

31
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,409
Run to the boat!

32
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,510
You of it occupy and save it!

33
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,220
Included/understood!

34
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,480
Quickly! But prudently…

35
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,100
- It is cold!
- Baka! It is Robin who is cold!

36
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,110
Stop.

37
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,760
I advise you not to save this woman.

38
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,640
They is false.

39
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,150
Pirates need such a woman.

40
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,030
You seem to have very included/understood, Miss.

41
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,350
Could you shift?

42
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,980
Nami-san!

43
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,219
I will not allow myself…

44
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,449
To make as good seems you!

45
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,120
Wait, the guys!

46
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,370
You do not occupy of that.

47
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,460
I will undertake some all alone.

48
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,690
Let us stop…

49
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,470
You and me! With against one!

50
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,890
Ca is equal for me, but…

51
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,280
I gain nothing there to capture you…

52
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,250
I thus will kill you.

53
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,009
Does it breathe… Not it cannot…

54
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,349
It is probably choking itself.

55
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,849
Then it will die if one does not hurry?

56
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,560
But it will break if we heat it too quickly.

57
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,020
We must restore the internal temperature of the body.

58
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,590
Will it be left there while making like that?

59
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,190
I do not see other solutions.

60
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,779
How can you not be sure?!

61
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,870
The life of Robin is in danger!

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,810
But I was never confronted with human frozen before!

63
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,060
Ao Kiji said that it was still alive…

64
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,740
- But I have evil to believe in it!
- Does not despair!

65
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,910
If you can nothing make, nobody other can it!

66
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,189
You are the doctor of this ship!

67
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,130
I KNOW IT! A LITTLE SILENCE PLEASE!

68
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,030
Chopper!

69
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,080
What? You are only three?!

70
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,509
I will tell you later!

71
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,190
We will go back there!

72
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,860
But initially, do something for our arms and our legs cold!

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Aah, of agreement.

74
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,330
Hum…

75
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,240
You must immediately dissolve the hardened zones!

76
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,869
But the shower is occupied by Robin.

77
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,370
Is Robin well?

78
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
I have doubts…

79
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,390
What?

80
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,220
Is they good like that?

81
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,760
Once all melted at low temperature, go up on the boat to mass you the members!

82
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,950
Nami, helps me for Robin!

83
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,100
What do you make there? Where are Luffy and Ao Kiji?!

84
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,020
They fight with against one.

85
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,420
Against one?! You left it all alone?!

86
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,450
It is an order of the captain.

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,150
You cannot do that, even if it is an order of the captain!

88
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,779
How can you be also cruel?! Luffy is…

89
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,770
Keep silent yourself!

90
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,840
It is a combat with against one! You do not include/understand?!

91
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,080
STOP NOW!

92
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,320
The moment is critical for us all.

93
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,090
If it is still one of its whims…

94
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,690
We must expect worst!

95
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,640
As I suspected it, you are not like the others.

96
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,170
GOMU GOMU NO…

97
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,440
STORM

98
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,140
ICE TIME!

99
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,590
Let us stop you and me, against one!

100
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,680
Good blood, I was made berner.

101
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,410
By accepting this combat with against one…

102
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,500
Only one gains, and it, isn't is finished?

103
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,850
If I put the hand on the others…

104
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,200
It would be dishonest person of my share. Isn't this Captain?

105
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,620
Or…

106
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,740
Did you really think of being able to beat me?

107
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,190
Let to me say a thing

108
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,070
In a near future…

109
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,050
This woman will become unverifiable.

110
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,700
You will be overpowered by the curse…

111
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,710
That Nico Robin carries since his birth.

112
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,850
Here what arrives when a woman such as it…

113
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,400
Go up on board a ship…

114
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,320
Monkey D. Luffy!

115
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,390
Ca does not pose any problem for me to explode to you now…

116
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,300
I have a debt towards you however.

117
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,630
From share your victory over Crocodile, I pass sponge.

118
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,900
And…

119
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,280
Heu. Forget that…

120
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Still a connery of Smoker.

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,420
With more.

122
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,349
Here it is!

123
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,350
Luffy!

124
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,900
It is still whole!

125
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,239
It is a good thing.

126
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,100
Let us bring back it…

127
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,929
Quickly with the boat!

128
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,060
Stop repeating what I say!

129
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,120
According to this log book…

130
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,000
Their next destination will be…

131
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,170
Seven toilets…

132
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,960
The city of water.

133
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,980
Alalala!

134
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,500
They approach the general headquarter more and more.

135
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,560
Ooops, sorry!

136
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,820
Their heart…

137
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,120
Are…

138
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,920
Given to beat!

139
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,330
Yatta!

140
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,759
- Luffy!
- Robin-chan!

141
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,990
Not, not yet! If you return, you will make noise too much!

142
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,929
Ok, Dr. Chopper.

143
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,440
I can be useful to you?

144
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,490
But… you know… To call me Doctor does not return to me especially content!

145
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,439
Ah! When they awake, an hot drink would be ideal.

146
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,319
I will then install them in the room of rest.

147
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,700
Yes yes, Sir!

148
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,880
Nami, does one have to hoist the veils?

149
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,999
We will not leave with a captain in such a state.

150
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,280
The route is ready, but remain here for the night.

151
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,020
What is there, Ussop?

152
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,330
You are burst?

153
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,330
Of other guys as powerful as him…

154
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,820
Now will leave to our research?

155
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,000
All of which I was able was to run while shouting.

156
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,060
Lie down, baka.

157
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,720
You are just tired.

158
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,109
In order to grant a little respite to Luffy and Robin…

159
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,290
The Merry Vogue dropped anchor during four days.

160
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,170
A little later we hoisted the veils…

161
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,360
And we have sailed thus for three days.

162
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,280
The sky is blue, and one would believe oneself in spring.

163
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,910
And sometimes even in summer.

164
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
What a splendid weather!

165
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,720
Nami-swaaan!

166
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,820
I prepared you some potatoes in straw, Miss.

167
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,870
If you want it well.

168
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,979
Delicious!

169
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,630
I am happy!

170
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,610
Make less noise, I do not manage to sleep.

171
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,929
Yeah, yeah, afflicted, Mr. Cactus.

172
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,130
What you said ace, poor eyebrows!

173
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,739
How you called me?!

174
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,330
Poor eyebrows.

175
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,960
Lu-ffy there! Lu-ffy there! Lu-ffy there!

176
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,930
awaited we so much!
- Luffy!

177
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,680
Me, in intimidation….

178
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,600
Me, but frozen.

179
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,930
How can it still do that after having failed to die frozen?

180
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,189
- How was it?
- It was exactly like that, Luffy!

181
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,619
Clean to me all that, Luffy!

182
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,109
Hein? Do Nami, what you eat?

183
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,970
Straw. They are potatoes.

184
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,769
Potatos?

185
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,490
I am hungry, me too! He, Sanji!

186
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,849
How long do you have to sleep to be able to be satisfied?

187
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,219
Deal with your business! You want to fight?

188
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,289
Ok ok, that is enough!

189
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,679
Sanji-kun, the captain wants a little straw.

190
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,789
Ouuiiii, Nami-swaan!

191
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,190
Sanji, of potatos, potatos!

192
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,880
Even in convalescence, you remainders always the same one.

193
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,450
Ca is called “straw”, delicious.

194
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,050
Why “straw”?

195
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,399
(Actually, Paille refers to the straw hat. Potatoes in straw = fried)

196
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,530
I killed it. It made at least 100 meters length.

197
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,000
Hundred meters?!

198
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,570
It is giant, Ussop!

199
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,510
(Japanese Way to say “it was cake”)

200
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,120
Did you rise early to kill it?

201
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,400
Am Chopper, how I called?

202
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:05,630
- Ah yes, it is… Ca-captain…
- But of course! My name is Captain… Usso…

203
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,780
Robin.

204
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,630
Robin-chwan!

205
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,560
Robin!

206
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,830
How do you feel you? Do you have shivers?

207
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,709
I am well, thanks to you.

208
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,600
Thank you, Doctor.

209
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,189
You know… Even if you call me Doctor, that does not return to me more content!

210
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,089
It with the content air.

211
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,820
Yes.

212
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,180
Do not exhaust you, Robin.

213
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,070
Direction not guilty not to be itself as energetic as Luffy.

214
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,420
You can still rest.

215
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,400
Do not take that like a compliment!

216
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,850
Robin-chan.

217
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,250
Do I have to prepare you something of heat?

218
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,730
Did you find the appetite?

219
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,360
Then…

220
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,310
Do I can have a little coffee?

221
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Ouuiii! With pleasure!

222
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,740
It is what that?

223
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
I cannot prevent myself from eating the straw of Sanji-kun.

224
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,119
Delicious!

225
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,390
With which temperature is cooking?

226
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,540
He, Luffy!

227
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,310
A frog which swims the crawl!

228
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,360
What?

229
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,430
Make the turn and come to see!

230
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,489
Really?

231
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,640
A frog? You want to say “this” frog?

232
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,519
He Luffy. Do you still believe what this stupid admiral says?

233
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,439
It is impossible that a frog which swims the crawl…

234
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,459
Can EXIST!

235
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,509
This frog swims the crawl!

236
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,209
Let us follow it!

237
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,179
Yes!

238
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,859
Tighten the veils! Leave the oars! Follow this small beast!

239
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,909
Yes!

240
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,959
More quickly!

241
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,950
I do not know what it is, but I want to know!

242
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,510
Afflicted to have made you wait, Misses.

243
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,590
What was it?

244
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,870
What does it occur?

245
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,220
It would seem that the boat changes direction.

246
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,249
He, you!

247
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,680
Why we change direction?!

248
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,860
One located a large covered frog of scars!

249
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,720
What do you want to say?

250
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,359
One will make a barbecue of it!

251
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,840
You want to eat that?!

252
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,170
It is true…

253
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,550
Would this be a headlight?

254
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,490
Why this headlight over there?

255
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,320
Does Y' have somebody over there?

256
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,600
It is what, an island?

257
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,079
It is a headlight. This place was not envisaged on the Log Poses.

258
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,899
And the frog?! In which direction does go it?

259
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,030
Not question!

260
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,740
The frog moves towards the headlight.

261
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,309
Initially, to pass frog to the miller with white wine…

262
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,580
Then to coat it with flour and to fry it.

263
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,160
He, Sanji-kun!

264
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,560
If the captain said it, we, isn't this must go there?

265
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,390
Robin.

266
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,379
Yosha!

267
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,169
Any power!

268
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,189
Yes!

269
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,310
Why you pass all its whims to him?!

270
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,700
It flies!

271
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,449
Do not let it escape!

272
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,530
Row in its direction!

273
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,070
Something was run up against.

274
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,620
Are Nami-chan, Robin-chan, you well?

275
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,010
To some extent, yes.

276
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,050
I am well.

277
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,970
Pfiou, they is good.

278
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,060
It is what this noise?

279
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,900
What does it occur?

280
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,420
Did not say to me that it is…

281
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,780
What does this trick make here?

282
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,630
Half-turn, half-turn! Turn to 180 degrees!

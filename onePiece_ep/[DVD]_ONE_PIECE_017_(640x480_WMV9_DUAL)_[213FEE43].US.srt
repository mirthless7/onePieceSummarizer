1
00:01:54,137 --> 00:01:54,805
He's here!

2
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,931
What?!

3
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:02,604
What do you take your men for?!!

4
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:02,813
What do you take your men for?!!

5
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:02,854
What do you take your men for?!!

6
00:02:02,854 --> 00:02:03,146
What do you take your men for?!!

7
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:05,398
What do you take your men for?!!

8
00:02:05,398 --> 00:02:05,440
What do you take your men for?!!

9
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,482
What do you take your men for?!!

10
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,943
Found 'em!

11
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:14,157
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

12
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:14,199
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

13
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:14,282
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

14
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:14,408
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

15
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:20,414
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

16
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:20,455
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

17
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:20,539
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

18
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:20,580
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

19
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,622
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

20
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:20,705
COMPLETELY INFURIATED!
KURO VS LUFFY, FINAL BATTLE!

21
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:32,801
You tired?

22
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:37,055
Shakushi has too many useless movements.

23
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,391
Don't get cocky.

24
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:43,186
Up 'til now, I was just toying with you.

25
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:47,399
You'll receive special treatment.

26
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,194
I'll let you have a taste of what fear is...

27
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,281
Then I'll slowly work on you.

28
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:58,368
SHAKUSHI!

29
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,850
Let's see you run now.

30
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:21,892
Let's see you run now.

31
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,977
Shit! Let go you bastard!

32
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:24,102
Shit! Let go you bastard!

33
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:28,523
With this, your three years of detailed
planning has come to an end!

34
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,775
What'd you say?

35
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:30,233
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

36
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:30,734
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

37
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:30,859
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

38
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:31,068
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

39
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:31,193
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

40
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:31,443
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

41
00:03:31,443 --> 00:03:32,319
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

42
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:32,402
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

43
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:32,527
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

44
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:32,611
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

45
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:32,861
He's got a hold of Captain Kuro!

46
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:33,737
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

47
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:34,112
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

48
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:34,446
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

49
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:34,780
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

50
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:34,863
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

51
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:34,905
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

52
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:35,113
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

53
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:35,155
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

54
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:35,280
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,490
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

56
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:36,615
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

57
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:36,656
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

58
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:37,824
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

59
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:37,949
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be kilIed.

60
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:37,991
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be kilIed.

61
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,075
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be kilIed.

62
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:38,784
Maybe if he wins, then we won't be killed.

63
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:42,579
Time to die!

64
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,123
I won't let that happen!

65
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:51,546
You damn brats!

66
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,924
You damn brats!

67
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,553
You're too late, waistband guy!

68
00:03:58,553 --> 00:03:58,845
You're too late, waistband guy!

69
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:00,555
I don't think so.

70
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:06,561
That's right... that branch was in my way.

71
00:04:08,188 --> 00:04:08,897
What?

72
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,357
Usopp-san.

73
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,653
Get him, Rubber man!

74
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:16,446
Crush that Captain Kuro!

75
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:16,780
Crush that Captain Kuro!

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,532
Let go...

77
00:04:18,532 --> 00:04:18,573
Let go...

78
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:20,742
You guys...

79
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:24,037
DON'T CHEER FOR ME!!

80
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:26,665
Take a load of this, you Hypnotist!

81
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:28,708
Usopp-san.

82
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:30,669
Captain!

83
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:31,628
Let go!

84
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:32,254
Let go!

85
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,046
Let go!

86
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:34,973
GOMU GOMU NO...

87
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:37,558
TRUE SHOT!

88
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:38,817
FIRE STAR!

89
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,123
My...

90
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:43,974
IRON

91
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:45,808
My plan will...

92
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:45,851
IRON HEADBUTT!

93
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:45,976
IRON HEADBUTT!

94
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:46,101
IRON HEADBUTT!

95
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:49,018
Will never fail!!!
IRON HEADBUTT!

96
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,771
Will never fail!!!

97
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,229
It's over.

98
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,815
He beat Captain Kuro.

99
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:37,527
The Marines couldn't even do anything about that ''Devious Kuro''.

100
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,362
But, he really beat him!

101
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:40,113
Just who on earth are you?

102
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,323
Just who on earth are you?

103
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,620
Monkey D. Luffy

104
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,541
Against a pirate who'd discard his name
and run away from the sea...

105
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,418
There's no way I'd lose to such a guy.

106
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:57,798
A true pirate would never give up
his name 'tiI the day he dies.

107
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:01,343
Luffy? I'm sure I haven't heard that name before.

108
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:02,385
Remember my name for the rest of your lives!

109
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:03,637
Remember my name for the rest of your lives!

110
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:03,678
Remember my name for the rest of your lives!

111
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:03,970
Remember my name for the rest of your lives!

112
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,471
Remember my name for the rest of your lives!

113
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:04,638
Remember my name for the rest of your lives!

114
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:07,808
For I am the man who'll become
the next Pirate King!

115
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,103
He...

116
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,107
Get him outta here!

117
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:15,148
Get him outta here!

118
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:15,190
Get him outta here!

119
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,232
Get him outta here!

120
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:15,398
Get him outta here!

121
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:15,565
Get him outta here!

122
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:16,024
Get him outta here!

123
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:16,274
Get him outta here!

124
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:16,441
Get him outta here!

125
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,611
Don't dare to come back again!

126
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,628
Thanks for the hard work.

127
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:44,302
Even you'd be exhausted after
a fight like that, wouldn't you?

128
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:45,554
Hey.

129
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,224
What were you so angry about earlier?

130
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:49,391
What were you so angry about earlier?

131
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:52,894
I don't like them.

132
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:54,813
They're plain wrong.

133
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:59,609
Companions aren't meant to be regarded that way.

134
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,654
What're you talking about?

135
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:04,531
That's just how it is.

136
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,827
Pirates aren't as noble as they are in your dreams.

137
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,329
Captain Kuro is a standard example.

138
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:11,455
Captain Kuro is a standard example.

139
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:15,459
I want some meat.

140
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,461
Why I oughta...

141
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:26,678
Can you keep everything that's happened a secret?

142
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:26,803
Can you keep everything that's happened a secret?

143
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:28,638
Can you keep everything that's happened a secret?

144
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,849
Eh?! A secret?

145
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,809
Why should we do such a thing?

146
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:36,521
Yeah! We all fought with our
Iives to protect the viIlage.

147
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,524
Captain, everyone would look at you differently.

148
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,651
You'll become our village's hero!

149
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,153
Yeah, that's right!

150
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:43,653
Yeah, that's right!

151
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:47,157
Usopp-san, you should clear up all
misunderstandings with everyone.

152
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:47,240
Usopp-san, you should clear up all
misunderstandings with everyone.

153
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,618
What misunderstandings?

154
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,411
They'd just think that I'm lying like usual.

155
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,954
They'd just think that I'm lying like usual.

156
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:56,708
There's no point in telling them things of the past.

157
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,376
That would only create panic.

158
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:02,839
Besides, this one time special situation...

159
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:07,844
There shouldn't be anymore pirates that'd wanna
attack this secluded village ever again.

160
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,807
So Iet's just pretend as if nothing's happened.

161
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:12,140
So let's just pretend as if nothing's happened.

162
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,602
Everything... was just a hoax to fool everyone.

163
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,317
I won't force you...

164
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,527
No, I'll do it!

165
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,071
If it's best for the village!

166
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,406
Me two!

167
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:30,200
Me three, I won't say a word!

168
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:31,076
We will never say anything about this ever again!

169
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,194
Kaya...
We will never say anything about this ever again!

170
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:33,078
We will never say anything about this ever again!

171
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,704
Will you be tempted?

172
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:40,001
No.

173
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:46,842
It's already morn', I wonder if there's
something wrong with Usopp-kun?

174
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:49,928
He was acting weird.

175
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,596
Seemed like he was depressed.

176
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:54,099
Mama...

177
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:57,561
Isn't that lying oniichan coming today?

178
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,563
You littIe Iiar...

179
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,690
isn't here yet today?

180
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,610
Maybe I was too harsh yesterday.

181
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:09,406
I'm sure he'll be back to his old self tomorrow...

182
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,657
I'm sure of it

183
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,330
Thanks.

184
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:20,709
Without you guys, I wouldn't have
been able to protect this village.

185
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,044
What're you babbling about?

186
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:26,631
If you didn't risk your own life for this,
I wouldn't have done anything at all.

187
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:28,175
Same here!

188
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,636
All that doesn't matter now.

189
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,389
I've got my treasures now.

190
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:47,277
Thanks to this incident, I've finally
decided upon something.

191
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:54,284
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

192
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:01,458
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

193
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:13,210
Captain Usopp, what did you
want to talk to us about?

194
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,264
You guys sure did an excellent job,

195
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,850
fighting against that Kuroneko Pirate crew.

196
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:23,063
As your captain, I'm very proud of you!

197
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:24,931
It wasn't that great...

198
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:26,942
It's nothing compared to what you did.

199
00:10:27,101 --> 00:10:28,360
Kind of embarrassing, really.

200
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,279
No, you guys really did good.

201
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:35,951
Even though you were all scared,
you still protected Kaya.

202
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:42,124
Five years ago, when you guys were only four,
was when the Usopp Pirate crew took its form.

203
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,502
This proves to be the greatest and
most successful battle ever!

204
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:46,211
Aye!

205
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,921
Although somewhat unexpected...

206
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,800
I think I'll be sailing the seas alone.

207
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:59,099
I want to be a real pirate.

208
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:08,817
I've always wondered, if it's really okay for
me to stay here for the rest of my life?

209
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,237
After meeting them, I've finally made up my mind.

210
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,742
As a man, I must embrace that vast sea!

211
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:19,911
That's why, I must leave this village!

212
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:24,916
There's only one reason!

213
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,212
The pirate flag is beckoning me!

214
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,426
Captain, you're lying, right?

215
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,929
This is just another lie, right?

216
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,848
This is all too sudden!

217
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,642
Don't you love this village, Captain?

218
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:46,021
What will happen to the Usopp Pirate crew?

219
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,983
I want you guys to do something for me.

220
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,570
I don't want to tell anyone about this.

221
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,572
Please say ''Hi'' to them for me.

222
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:56,740
No way!

223
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:59,201
I don't wanna!

224
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:01,203
Don't leave, Captain!

225
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,791
This pIace... you guys stilI remember?

226
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:10,462
This is where we first met.

227
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:19,247
Finished!

228
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:20,847
Uso-oniichan.

229
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,309
Who are you guys?

230
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,559
Why are you being so familiar with me?

231
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:26,186
Because you're famous!

232
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,480
Yeah very famous.

233
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:30,080
I see.

234
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:30,565
So everyone's beginning to respect
me as Captain Usopp eh...

235
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:34,319
So everyone's beginning to respect
me as Captain Usopp eh...

236
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:38,156
Everyone calls him Usopp the Liar right,?

237
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:43,829
Yosh you guys will become part of
the Usopp Pirate crew as of today!

238
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:45,289
Eh??

239
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,040
Eh?! You can't say no!

240
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,710
We've been through a lot.

241
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,338
Everyone, chargel

242
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:53,380
Everyone, charge!

243
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,714
Everyone, charge!

244
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,717
It's a chameleon!

245
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:57,759
It's a chameleon!

246
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:57,801
It's a chameleon!

247
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,743
Catch it!

248
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,847
FLOUR STAR!

249
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:04,015
Amazing, Captain!

250
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,854
Of course, I am the brave warrior of the sea after all.

251
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:08,937
Of course, I am the brave warrior of the sea after all.

252
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:12,899
I don't wanna hear you talk about the past!

253
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,026
Yeah, I don't want to hear it!

254
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:17,237
Because you're not acting like yourself, Captain.

255
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,198
Why are you saying alI this, aIl of a sudden?

256
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:20,240
Why are you saying alI this, all of a sudden?

257
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,951
That... it's Iike...

258
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:25,412
Captain's an idiot...

259
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,330
Baka!

260
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:37,716
What are your ambitions?

261
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:40,427
I want to run a tavern!

262
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:43,430
I want to be a topnotch carpenter!

263
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,599
I want to become a writer.

264
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,519
Don't let the fire of your ambitions burn out!

265
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:55,108
You must vow... to follow your
own path... with determination!

266
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:58,320
Starting from today...

267
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:02,449
Usopp Pirate crew is...

268
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,539
Disbanded!

269
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,541
Disbanded!

270
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,341
(FOOD)

271
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,726
We've had our grub.
Guess it's time to go.

272
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:23,804
Right.

273
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,242
Here you are.

274
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,642
Yo, Ojousama.

275
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:30,310
Is it okay for you to be out and about?

276
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:39,236
In the past year, my illness was due to my highly
depressed state over my parents death.

277
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,697
Usopp-san took so much effort to cheer me up...

278
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,534
I can't just remain that way anymore.

279
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,162
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

280
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:50,330
Thank you very much.

281
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:56,670
I have prepared a little present for everyone.

282
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,381
I hope that you would accept it openheartedly.

283
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:10,892
It's done!

284
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,481
Gonna bid farewell to this house soon.

285
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,082
Yosh.

286
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:39,288
What??!

287
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,094
Why won't it come out?

288
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,640
Damn it..!

289
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,327
A caravel!

290
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:14,206
Is this really for us?

291
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:16,666
Yes, please accept it.

292
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:20,837
Although it is somewhat old-fashioned,
I was the one who designed it.

293
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:21,004
Although it is somewhat old-fashioned,
I was the one who designed it.

294
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:21,046
Although it is somewhat old-fashioned,
I was the one who designed it.

295
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,129
Although it is somewhat old-fashioned,
I was the one who designed it.

296
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,589
Although it is somewhat old-fashioned,
I was the one who designed it.

297
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,006
Although it is somewhat old-fashioned,
I was the one who designed it.

298
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,428
The ship's frame and its triple-mast sails are
all part of a stern-centered control system.

299
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:28,470
The ship's frame and its triple-mast sails are
all part of a stern-centered controI system.

300
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,637
The ship's frame and its triple-mast sails are
all part of a stern-centered control system.

301
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:28,970
The ship's frame and its triple-mast sails are
all part of a stern-centered controI system.

302
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,179
The ship's frame and its triple-mast sails are
all part of a stern-centered control system.

303
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:32,849
I call it ''Going Merry''!

304
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,186
Let me brief you on how to operate it...

305
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:39,481
First, how to turn it on and adjust the power...

306
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,565
Ah! No, no!

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,692
You only need to tell me how to operate the ship.

308
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:42,734
You only need to tell me how to operate the ship.

309
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,404
Sure is a nice ship!

310
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,865
The figurehead of the ship is so cool!

311
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:53,120
I've prepared everything that's needed
to set sail aboard the ship.

312
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,622
Thank you, that's really thankful of you!

313
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,916
It's ''really thoughtful'', idiot!

314
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:04,506
Usopp-san!

315
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:07,843
What's he up to?

316
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,678
Anyways, let's just stop him.

317
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:12,013
He's heading straight for the ship.

318
00:17:16,393 --> 00:17:18,437
T-thanks.

319
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:23,775
So, you really are setting out
to the sea, Usopp-san?

320
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:26,445
Yeah, I should Ieave before I change my mind.

321
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,405
Yeah, I should leave before I change my mind.

322
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:31,700
Don't try to stop me.

323
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:32,826
I won't stop you.

324
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,703
I had a feeling that you would.

325
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,872
That's kind of disappointing.

326
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,750
Next time when I return to this village,

327
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,545
I'll tell you stories that are a lot more outrageous
than my previous taIl taIes!

328
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,090
I'll be looking forward to it!

329
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,634
You guys, take care too!

330
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,470
I'll see you again someday.

331
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:52,888
Why?

332
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:54,723
Why...

333
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,434
You're really slow, aren't you..?

334
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,646
I'll be a pirate just like you, so we
might meet on the sea one day.

335
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:03,356
What're you talking about?

336
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:04,816
Hurry up and get on.

337
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,903
We're already comrades.

338
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,371
C-captain...

339
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,708
I'm the captain!!

340
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,252
Don't be stupid, I'm the captain.

341
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,818
He left, Captain.

342
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:52,155
But you know what, I'm kinda relieved
that he's with those powerful guys.

343
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:53,365
Yeah, that's right.

344
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:55,534
I've never seen anyone as strong as them.

345
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,163
There's no helping it I guess, he'd always
said that he wanted to be a pirate.

346
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:03,333
If we told the villagers, they would aIl be sad.

347
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,043
It was so unexpected.

348
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,797
It was so lively and colorful
when Captain was around.

349
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:13,593
I have an idea!

350
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:14,845
About what?

351
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:18,723
He's got a good heart, hasn't he?

352
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:20,308
Meri.

353
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,393
What is it?

354
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:24,896
It's really hard to lie.

355
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,274
Are you talking about Kurahadol?

356
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:28,650
No.

357
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:33,864
So you're implying that you really wanted
to stop Usopp-kun from leaving?

358
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:38,744
Ojousama,

359
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:44,624
I've heard many stories from
the villagers of his childhood.

360
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:50,088
Soon after Usopp-kun's father left this village,

361
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,883
his mother passed away.

362
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,180
Pirates are coming!!

363
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,680
Pirates are coming!!

364
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,931
Pirates are coming!!

365
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:02,726
Pirates are coming!!

366
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:03,977
Dad's pirate ship is here!

367
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:04,311
Dad's pirate shIp is here!

368
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:04,352
Dad's pirate ship is here!

369
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:04,436
Dad's pirate ship is here!

370
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:04,603
Dad's pirate ship is here!

371
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,479
Hey Usopp, you mustn't shout!

372
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,938
Hey Usopp, you mustn't shout!

373
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:07,022
Hey Usopp, you mustn't shout!

374
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,734
Dad's come to take us away!

375
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:17,032
Stop talking nonsense, Usopp.

376
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:17,074
Stop talking nonsense, Usopp.

377
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,274
It's not...

378
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:22,496
When Mom recovers, he'll take us all out to the sea!

379
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:27,000
Your father won't be coming back.

380
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:33,423
But you know what, I'm still proud to have married your father.

381
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,762
There's this legendary medicine that could cure all diseases!

382
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:40,449
Don't be stupid...

383
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,849
You dream too much.

384
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,643
So what if I'm stupid, but I like to dream!

385
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,645
So what if I'm stupid, but I like to dream!

386
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:50,607
'Coz I'm the son of a pirate!

387
00:20:51,454 --> 00:20:56,738
Do become a brave man like your father.

388
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,749
Pirates are coming!!!

389
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,253
I'm not sure if he was just lonely, but he kept yelling
even after his mother had Iong passed away.

390
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,796
I'm not sure if he was just lonely, but he kept yelling
even after his mother had long passed away.

391
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:19,136
He always hoped that one day his father's
ship would show up at the coast.

392
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,597
And he'd take him out to the sea...

393
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:32,149
The villagers believe that his hopes
are hidden within his lies.

394
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,527
Pirates!!!

395
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,989
To him, who had lost both his parents...

396
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:43,827
couldn't just sit calmly when you
got into the same predicament.

397
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:48,498
From now on, you must become stronger.

398
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:52,711
To repay what he has done for you.

399
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:02,804
To our new ship and new friend!

400
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:05,223
Cheers!!!

401
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:09,853
They told me...

402
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,690
They don't fight to die, but to live.

403
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:19,112
Within Usopp-san's lies, it's always filled with the joy of life.

404
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,656
He's been encouraging me to live.

405
00:22:22,282 --> 00:22:23,116
Yes, he has.

406
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:25,160
Here we go!

407
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:27,245
Are we really doing it?

408
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,538
Let's do it!

409
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:30,999
We must carry on our captain's spirit!

410
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,752
One, two, three...

411
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:43,053
Pirates are coming!!!

412
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,138
You know what Meri...

413
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,432
I want to be a doctor!

414
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:51,853
Oh, that's a wonderful goal.

1
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:04,770
A city which loves the pirates?

2
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:04,770
Arrival with Whiskey Peak

3
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,770
But from where this foutue snow can come well?

4
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,640
The weather was nice and hot one minute ago.

5
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,840
Ouais, and here!

6
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,420
The man who goes down from the sky:
Mr. Bonhomme de neige!

7
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,090
I never saw somebody of also no one to carve snow.

8
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,880
Admire! Here is the art come from my heart:
Snow Queen!

9
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,850
Ouah! Too much extremely!

10
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,070
Fist of Mr. Bonhomme de neige!

11
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,510
I go you botter the bottom!!

12
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,030
Ah! Mr. Bonhomme de neige!
You will see!

13
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,630
Hold!
Take that!

14
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,980
Dumb!
You will see…

15
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,710
Where these deux-là find do as much energy by a similar cold?

16
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,190
Nami-San, how long will I continue my clearing of snow of love?

17
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,770
Until it stops snowing, Sanji-Kun.

18
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,460
Of agreement, Nami-San!

19
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,730
He, you! Does Y' have anything to eat on this boat?

20
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,970
That curdles here.

21
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,430
Close it!

22
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,870
You are not our guests, you two!!

23
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,690
Leave from here and will remove snow!!

24
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,580
A flash?

25
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,240
Does Y' have a problem with time here or what?

26
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,520
The weather was very nice presently,

27
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,540
and without reason, it started to snow.

28
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,910
And maintaining the thunder and the flashes…

29
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,500
The seasons are completely put out of order.

30
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,700
It is as Crocus-San had said…

31
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,660
It is Grand Line.

32
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,550
It would be said that you do not know where we are.

33
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,240
And you do not even use the rudder.
You really believe that it is an good idea?

34
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,870
I checked our direction just a second ago.

35
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,520
Qu… What?

36
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,440
It is what?

37
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,470
What is there, Nami-San?

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Impossible!

39
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,800
Make turn the ship of 180°! Quickly!

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,910
180°? Why half-turn is made?

41
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,900
You ace forgotten something?

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,390
The ship reversed its direction and we go in the bad direction.

43
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,180
I left the Log Poses eyes only one second.

44
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,850
And the sea was so calm.

45
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,410
You are really navigatrice?

46
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,010
On this ocean…
Wind, sky, waves, clouds…

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,200
You cannot trust them.

48
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,060
The only thing that you can believe,

49
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,140
it is the direction which the Log Installation indicates.

50
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,800
Included/understood?

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,860
Stop making me the lesson and leave to help them!

52
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,570
Turn the mainsail!
Made take the wind by starboard to him!

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,420
Turn the ship of 180°!

54
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,740
Usopp, occupies jib!

55
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,190
Sanji-Kun, take the bar!
I occupy myself some, Nami-San!

56
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,680
You two, do not trail!

57
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,880
What a malpolie, the bitchy girl!

58
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,450
He, wait, the wind changes direction!
Impossible!

59
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,990
The first sign of spring!
What?

60
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,680
Species of moron! Do not sleep whereas you are covered with snow!!

61
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,570
He, y' has dolphins over there.
Let us see them!

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,180
Close it, you!

63
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,060
The waves do not stop growing bigger!

64
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,250
Iceberg at 10 a.m.!

65
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,610
Nami-San, of the fog!

66
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,390
But what is it that this ocean??

67
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,890
One will run up against it!!!!!!

68
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,090
He, the ship takes water in the compartment!

69
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,770
We must stop the escape of speed!
I undertake some!

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,220
The clouds move very quickly.

71
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,580
Wind…

72
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,140
Enormous!

73
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,610
Here it is.

74
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,710
Lower the veils!

75
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,100
The wind is increasingly strong!

76
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,220
If the veils continue to take the wind like that, one will be turned over!

77
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,750
You all, here is a in-case!

78
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,930
That will give again you forces.

79
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,830
Morfale! Take too much of it to you!

80
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,110
Zut! The sail tears!

81
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,100
You ace nothing to make, then goes up and manages to repair it!

82
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,970
There is another water way in the hold!
Good blood!

83
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,740
Which good nap.

84
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,120
You are not a little lazy whereas the weather is splendid?

85
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,200
You know where one goes, not?

86
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,790
You…

87
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,920
What do you card-index on board both?

88
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,160
The farm!

89
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,400
We move towards their city.

90
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,230
A place called Whiskey Peak.

91
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,950
You want to say that they on their premises are brought back?

92
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,170
It is not as if them something were owed…

93
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,460
Ouais, it is true.

94
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,990
Good, for what I say…

95
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,830
You have underhand heads plotters.

96
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,220
It is what your names already?

97
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,780
I am Mr. 9.

98
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,970
Wednesday miss.

99
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,450
Really?

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,110
I do not stop thinking of these names since I heard them.

101
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,580
P' to be to you although I heard them front, or p' to be to you not…

102
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,640
Finally… Not engraves.

103
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,640
You.

104
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,470
I hope that you appreciated your small nap.

105
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,490
You ace not stopped whirring despite everything our efforts to awake you.

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,590
Remain all on your guards.

107
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,940
Who knows what still will arrive to us.

108
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,910
I finally manage to apprehend the dangers of this ocean.

109
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,720
I include/understand from which this name comes from Large Line.

110
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,720
Even me, with my qualities of navigatrice except par, I have evil!

111
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,160
But that will go!

112
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,470
One… really will leave oneself there?

113
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,550
That will go.

114
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,230
Something of good will arrive to us.

115
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,250
And if you want a proof… Look at!

116
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,930
The first stage of our voyage is finished!

117
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,840
Ground!

118
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,160
Then here is Whiskey Peak.

119
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,180
This island is odd.

120
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,090
Look at these enormous cacti!

121
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,560
It is here that we go down.

122
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,910
Thank you for the ballade, my nice.

123
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,530
We will be re-examined, if it is written.

124
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,130
Bye bye baby!

125
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,580
They left.

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,930
But it was which these guy?

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,100
One of fout! One arrived!

128
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,340
It there with the mouth of a right river in front.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
One will be able to unload here.

130
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,850
You do not believe that one is likely to meet monsters or another thing here, not?

131
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,630
One never knows, that could arrive.

132
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,370
It is Grand Line.

133
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,150
If monsters are crossed, one will have to only draw, not?

134
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,150
Wait a little.

135
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,200
Do not forget that we must remain a certain time on this island.

136
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,700
Why?

137
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,980
The Log Installation must memorize the magnetic field of the island

138
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,920
and then, we will be able to move towards the following island.

139
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,290
Time that it is necessary for this memorizing depends on each island.

140
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,430
For certain islands that will take a few hours,
and for others of the days.

141
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,280
Qu… Qu… What?

142
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,920
Therefore, even if one wanted to draw from this island to the monsters,

143
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,810
one could be obliged to remain days because of the Log?

144
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,840
Exactly.

145
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,480
If that arrives, one will see at the proper time.
One goes there!

146
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,110
Luffy rightly.

147
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,660
On the way. That will lead us to nothing to think of it without stop.

148
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,220
And no matter what it arrives, I will protect Nami-San!

149
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,150
He… the guy, listen to me.

150
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,900
I caught a disease which prevents me from leaving.
Go, one goes there!

151
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,670
Loans?

152
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,530
But, prepare you do not forget to flee or beat you at any time.

153
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,300
Euh… It is… Euh…

154
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,630
And my terrible disease then?

155
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,770
Does nobody listen to me?

156
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,080
I wonder what one will find in their shops.

157
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,750
Please…

158
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,880
It is a pirate boat.

159
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,640
Pirates arrive.

160
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,140
I see movements.

161
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,180
People? There are people on the beach!

162
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,130
Remain all on your guards.

163
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,750
Me… Shit.

164
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,270
I believe that I must prepare in the worst case.

165
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,790
Monsters or no matter what you are…
You show!!!

166
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,370
Welcome on Large Line!

167
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,130
Welcome in our city!

168
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,450
The city of the celebration… Whiskey Peak!

169
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,740
Does the island with the monsters… accommodate us?

170
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,930
Quest this that wants to say?

171
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,100
Pirates! Be welcome!

172
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,350
Long life with the heroes of the seas! Banzaiii!!

173
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,680
Y' has full girls guns here!

174
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,580
They love us.
The pirates are the heroes of everyone!

175
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,470
Bienve…
My my maaa.

176
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,890
Welcome!

177
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,340
I am called Igarappoi.

178
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,460
I am the mayor of Whiskey Peak.

179
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,670
I am called Luffy.
Enchanted!

180
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,370
Ossan, your hair is buckled bloody too much.

181
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,100
The alcohol distilling and the music, it is that, Whiskey Peak.

182
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,950
We are proud of our hospitality.

183
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,300
We have a whole spirit ocean for your good pleasure.

184
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,920
Would you agree to join to you to us to have fun the festival and to share the stories of your adventures?

185
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,050
Us serio…
My my maaa.

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,380
We would be charm to hear them.

187
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,220
With pleasure!!!

188
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,040
Three idiots…

189
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,940
He, say to me…

190
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,440
How long is it necessary for the Log Poses to memorize the magnetic field of this island?

191
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,540
Log?

192
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,390
Now let us not speak about tedious things.

193
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,440
Thus take a rest deserved well after your voyage, I request from you.

194
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,140
, You all go, prepare the feast.

195
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,650
A song for our adventurous guests!

196
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,670
Ouais!!!

197
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,200
And after I said, very calmly…

198
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,070
“Filth of monstre marin, you will not touch a hair of my friends!”

199
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,070
Yaaaa, Usopp Captain!

200
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,060
Bah, when one is escaped of Calm Belt,

201
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,580
I admit that even me I shivered.

202
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,000
Shivers of excitation, of course.

203
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,860
Super!
A cheer for Usopp-San!

204
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,600
Here! Drink as far as you want.

205
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,710
Not, thank you. I do not drink alcohol.

206
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,730
You in fai…
My my maaa.

207
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,390
Of made you not.

208
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,810
It is our finest wine, manufactured with vines of more top quality, our “Special Drink”.

209
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,880
Although it is called the Wine of the Sea,

210
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,900
it is far from alcoholic.

211
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,270
It is true. It is really delicious.

212
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,280
The harvest of vine was exceptional this year.

213
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,710
And to celebrate harvest, our traditional contest of Kampai!

214
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,530
I explain you. It is a contest where everyone drinks without stopping,

215
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,590
and the last upright is the winner.

216
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,120
Everyone can take part.

217
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,710
Not, that will go.

218
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,590
I will not be able to undoubtedly drink as much.

219
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,030
The reward is of… 100000

220
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,680
Fill to me that!

221
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,950
Zoro, you participles too!

222
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,140
Be mown to you, not?

223
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,870
Kampai!

224
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,130
Ouah! It is already with its 10th tankard!

225
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,800
I in…

226
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,780
can more…

227
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,650
But it is already with its 12th tankard!
Oh Yeah!

228
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,380
Still!

229
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,690
The captain ate like 20 people!

230
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,120
The cook disappeared!

231
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,580
… Rest is necessary for me.

232
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,660
And this type picks up 20 girls at the same time!

233
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,690
But what is it that this crew?

234
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,630
Which délici…
My my maaa.

235
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,370
Which delicious evening.

236
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,920
Which joy of seeing that everyone has fun.

237
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,270
Yes, really.

238
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,950
Which joy.

239
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:57,580
“And thus, because of their intervention, our mission of provisioning failed.”

240
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,340
“Nevertheless, we announce you that we attracted them”

241
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,990
“successfully on the island of the cacti.”
B.A.B.Y.

242
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:12,400
Very well. Let us send that to the Boss and we will be out of cause.

243
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,490
You are right. I will deposit it in the box of Unluckies.

244
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,660
They will carry it for us…

245
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,220
With the Boss…

246
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,360
And here. I can about it more.

247
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,250
A small nap.

248
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,300
And after 13 tankards, Oniichan is with the carpet!

249
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,670
Does Bah Zoro, it arrive to you what?
Which chochotte.

250
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,100
There remain only these deux-là.

251
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,290
It is with its 15th tankard.

252
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,540
Its rival is Sister!

253
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,190
You should go perhaps there mollo for your health.

254
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,200
Of no matter what you cause?

255
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,670
I laiss' spoke not to fall before having the reward!

256
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,130
They was too good!

257
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,160
And now, three cooks are with ground!

258
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,810
That pleased to me.

259
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,200
It is too…

260
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,150
I gained!!!!!

261
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,400
Oh, I do not feel well.

262
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,720
And finally, it is with ground.

263
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,390
I adore this city.

264
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,450
I am with the paradise…

265
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,620
Lastly, they are exhausted and they fell asleep.

266
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,750
Made beautiful dreams,

267
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,950
my small adventurers.

268
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,450
This night, the splendid Rock-Cacti resplendissent with the moonlight.

269
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,230
I did not know you poet, Igarappoi!

270
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,230
Or rather, Mr. 8.

271
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,020
It is you.

272
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,620
And them?

273
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,470
They fell.

274
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,810
Right in hell.

275
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,050
Frankly,

276
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,080
which band of heading.

277
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,140
One had to add more and more alcohol in their drinks.

278
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,760
In the contrary case, they would be still debouts to have fun the festival.

279
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,800
And then, was this really necessary to make all this comedy?

280
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,230
For five unhappy kids?

281
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,950
One should have regulated their account with the port to them.

282
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,730
Already before their arrival, the city underwent a shortage of food.

283
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,780
I suspected that these deux-là would not bring back meat for us of whale.

284
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,680
I do not allow you!

285
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,440
We made our better, I announce you!

286
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,460
You calm!

287
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,780
Look at that. I got information about them.

288
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,650
Tren… Thirty million Berrys?
For these types?

289
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,840
Insane which is that judges a pirate on his only appearance,

290
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,860
Miss Mo…
My my maaa.

291
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,330
Monday miss.

292
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,980
I have shame.

293
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,790
But now that their fate is regulated,

294
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
we can send a report/ratio favorable to the Boss.

295
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,230
Let us take all immediately their valuable articles in their boat.

296
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,910
And them?

297
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,400
What does one make some?

298
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,840
If we kill them, we lose 30% of the premium.

299
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,130
The government prefers the public executions.

300
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,440
Go! Capture them alive!

301
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,770
He! Afflicted to stop you.

302
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,810
You could not let them sleep still a little? The voyage tired them.

303
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,510
Mr. 8!
Monday miss!

304
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,210
The type with the katana slipped by!

305
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,210
It is up there.

306
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,820
Dumb!

307
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,870
You should be drunk dead!

308
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,950
No swashbuckler worthy of this name

309
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,090
does not let itself take with the trap of drink.

310
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,640
I include/understand what occurs here.

311
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,640
It is a den of hunters of premium.

312
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,480
You mislead the pirates very glad to arrive on Grand Line,

313
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,540
and then steal you to them all that they have.

314
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,680
There is about a hundred hunters of premium here.

315
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,340
I will deal with you,

316
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,610
Works baroque.

317
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,530
From where do you know the name of our organization??

318
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,540
A few times ago, I were me also trade.
And your organization proposed a place to me,

319
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,630
but I refused, obviously.

320
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,100
The members of the organisaton are unaware of all of the other members,

321
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,620
and they are called by code names.

322
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,100
And of course, the identity and the den of the Boss remain a mystery for everyone.

323
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,600
An criminal organization who obeys the orders well wisely.

324
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,550
Works baroque.

325
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,680
Was Oh, it supposed being a secrecy?

326
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,650
Here are which is very surprising.

327
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,920
Since you know our small secrecy, we thus will have to eliminate you.

328
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,120
This night still…

329
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,050
We will add a new tomb stone on the Rock-Cacti.

330
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,640
Kill it!!!

331
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,270
It… disappeared!

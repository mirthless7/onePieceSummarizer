1
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,774
While attempting to escape from Upper Yard,

2
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:06,195
Nami's team was confronted by God Enel, who displayed his fearsome power.

3
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,450
Meanwhile, the four members of the exploration team,

4
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,450
had become separated on their way to the ancient city.

5
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,164
Luffy later engaged in battle against the Shandian warrior, Wiper.

6
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,248
BAZOOKA!!
BAZOOKA!!

7
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:42,732
Nami's team then faced a new enemy!

8
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,275
Like hell you don't!

9
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:44,400
My name is Hotori!

10
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,442
My name is Hotori!

11
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:44,901
My name is Hotori!

12
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:45,735
My name is Hotori!

13
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:48,321
My name is Kotori!

14
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:52,199
And our third brother was taken out by you guys!

15
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:58,497
And Chopper, after becoming hopelessly lost, found himself face to face with a Priest Gedatsu.

16
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:00,791
Where'd it go!?

17
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,713
SCARY!

18
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:13,888
ORDEAL OF SWAMP!
CHOPPER VS PRIEST GEDATSU!!

19
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,215
This is... a monument to the city.

20
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:57,890
Their ancestors must have erected it after the city fell.

21
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,435
Shandra.

22
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,230
That was the ancient city's name.

23
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:11,779
Year 402 of the Kaien  Calendar.

24
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:16,826
The city was at the peak of its prosperity over 1,100 years ago.

25
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:19,120
And then it fell 800 years ago.

26
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:27,586
The 100 years of history which vanished from the world without a trace...

27
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:31,903
Perhaps this island holds some knowledge,

28
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:36,303
Of the untellable history that cannot be found on the sea below.

29
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,308
This is a complete map of Shandra.

30
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:44,854
Perhaps i'll learn something if i go to the center of the city.

31
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:47,314
Some clue about the untellable history.

32
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:48,566
Who's there?

33
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,485
My, what a lovely young lady.

34
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,655
Are you another one of God's servants?

35
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,115
Servant?

36
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,951
Silence that mouth of yours.

37
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:03,038
I am the Chief Enforcer in God Enel's service, Yama!

38
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,126
And? What is it that you want, Mr. Chief Enforcer?

39
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,878
You will see soon enough.

40
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:23,976
Where did it go!?

41
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,356
A stealth technique, no doubt.

42
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,234
This guy's got his eyes rolled back!

43
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,445
Those white eyes are scary!

44
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:43,329
Gedatsu-sama! If you do not direct your eyes foward, you cannot see your enemy!

45
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,789
How careless!

46
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,459
Is this guy an idiot!?

47
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:50,878
An enemy?

48
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:52,296
I get it now!

49
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:54,465
You must be one of the Priests!

50
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,390
That is correct, heso.

51
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,270
I am the Guardian of the Sky, Gedatsu!

52
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,813
A Priest in the service of the almighty God Enel!

53
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:13,651
I govern the Ordeal of Swamp on Upper Yard.

54
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:17,112
Say something, you dimwit!

55
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,784
Gedatsu-sama! if you do not speak, the enemy cannot hear you!

56
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,661
How careless!

57
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,871
HOW CAN YOU FORGET THAT!?

58
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:36,256
I advise you to watch where you step!

59
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,884
Lying all around us is Swamp Cloud!

60
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:43,931
Once the swamp has seized you, will never reach solid footing again!

61
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:47,518
The survival rate is 50%!

62
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:48,769
How careless...

63
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:49,812
Swamp?

64
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,522
The Ordeal of Swamp!

65
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,483
YOU'RE SINKING!?

66
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,944
Fool, I am not affected by it!

67
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,613
SWAMP CLOUD COUNTERMEASURE!

68
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:03,325
MILKY DIAL!

69
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:12,376
Wow, Cool!

70
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:17,339
Something's blowing out of the bottom of his feet and he's using it to fly!

71
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:20,884
Wow, he looks so awesome!

72
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,432
Something's blowing out of his hands too...

73
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:30,436
One tanuki is hardly worth my trouble.

74
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,563
Eat this!

75
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:36,024
SWAMP CLOUD BURGER!

76
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:39,486
It has the density of a cloud, and the properties of a swamp!

77
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:41,947
Once touched, nothing can escape it!

78
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:45,492
Gedatsu-sama! No! You aren't supposed to aim at me...

79
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:55,752
He can't get it off!

80
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,965
That's right. It's a cloud.

81
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:02,426
If you try to push against it, your hand just passes right through it!

82
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:10,350
The more you struggle, the farther you get sucked in!

83
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:16,440
I've gotta save him!

84
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,108
There you are, tanuki!

85
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:21,236
SWAMP CLOUD BURGER!

86
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:25,949
SCARY!

87
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,493
If that hits me, I'm dead!

88
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,956
Oi! Are you okay?

89
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:34,291
Wake up!

90
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:35,667
Oi!

91
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,087
You've got to breathe!

92
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:41,089
Don't die!

93
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:46,261
Phew, you're alive!

94
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:50,724
You saved my life.

95
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:56,104
Allowing yourself to be saved by the enemy...

96
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:57,564
You have no dignity.

97
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:58,649
He's here!

98
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:04,613
And you dare call yourself one of God's 50 Enforcers of Skypiea?

99
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,950
Call it what you want!

100
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,619
I've had enough! I'll no longer serve you!

101
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:15,290
You will die by my Axe Dials!

102
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:20,003
Yosh, we'll team up and fight him together!

103
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,967
Bring it! We're not scared of you!

104
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,470
Very well.

105
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,430
JET PUNCH!

106
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,450
This is the extinct Jet Dial.

107
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,830
Ising this, I can throw an accelerated punch before my enemy even know he's been defeated!

108
00:09:56,746 --> 00:09:59,751
The only downside is that it tears holes in my clothes.

109
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:02,879
This is a Priest?

110
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,633
If i don't get out of here as fast as i can, I'm dead!

111
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,265
I can't run on the clouds!

112
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:14,975
The Swamp Cloud traps are everywhere!

113
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,087
I have to run on the ruins and get into the forest!

114
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,862
Where do you think you're going, tanuki?

115
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,323
JET PUNCH!

116
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,575
RUMBLE!

117
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,118
JUMPING POINT!

118
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,958
The effect of the Rumble Ball will last for only three minutes.

119
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,587
That means if i don't get out of here in three minutes, I'll be killed!

120
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:46,131
So' you've eaten a Zoan-type Devil's Fruit?

121
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,051
Don't bother running!

122
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:52,053
JET PUNCH!

123
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:52,929
HEAVY POINT!

124
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:53,430
HEAVY POINT!

125
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:53,972
HEAVY POINT!

126
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:58,810
SWAMP CLOUD BURGER!

127
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,520
That again!

128
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:01,146
GUARD POINT!

129
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:01,938
GUARD POINT!

130
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,569
Damn! You little shit!

131
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:07,986
BRAIN POINT!

132
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:08,069
BRAIN POINT!

133
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,111
BRAIN POINT!

134
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,112
BRAIN POINT!

135
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:11,990
SCOPE!

136
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,993
Weak point! He has to have a weak point!

137
00:11:14,993 --> 00:11:16,411
Anything!

138
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,371
I'll find a chance and get out of here!

139
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:21,124
JET PUNCH!

140
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,933
Even with... my Guard...

141
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:57,536
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

142
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,587
Just where do you think you are?

143
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,214
Don't damage these historic structures!

144
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:19,307
Rather than worrying about this rubble, you should be worrying about yourself, miss.

145
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,727
PUNCH MOUNTAIN!

146
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:26,481
Oh no!

147
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,451
You... fool!

148
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:51,881
Does this cave ever end?

149
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:54,509
No matter how far i walk, I can't find a way out.

150
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:58,722
I'm getting hungry.

151
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:01,975
But it doesn't look like there's anything to eat around here.

152
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:05,382
I wonder what Chopper and the others are up too.

153
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:08,982
If i get the chance to get out of here...

154
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,800
His feet.

155
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,555
I see his weak point.

156
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,935
WALK POINT!

157
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,607
Can i get away?

158
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,609
My vision's starting to blur.

159
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,987
He can still move?

160
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:01,367
My legs are shaking.

161
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:06,372
And... the effects of the Rumble Ball will run out soon.

162
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,154
That's right.

163
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm not going to run away.

164
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,160
I'll defeat him!

165
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,666
Hey, dammit!

166
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,292
What do you think you're doing!?

167
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,754
SWAMP CLOUD BURGER!

168
00:14:56,796 --> 00:15:01,177
I'm always the first to run away, so everyone has to protect me!

169
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,515
That's why they can't depend on me!

170
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,562
I'll raise my pirate flag here!

171
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,739
You have chosen an unsightly death.

172
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,908
The air is my territory!

173
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:25,118
Do you still not understand?

174
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,619
Come!

175
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:37,505
Was that it?

176
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:40,591
He took off my boot!?

177
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,224
Damned tanuki!

178
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:49,559
You chekky little shit!

179
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,191
I'm a monster!

180
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:00,486
AND I'M STRONG!

181
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:02,780
The weakest beasts roar the loudest.

182
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,616
JET PUNCH!

183
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:17,003
I let myself get carried away and lost control of my Mantra!

184
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:19,213
He missed!

185
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,465
That was close!

186
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,798
ARM POINT!

187
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:21,591
ARM POINT!

188
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:23,426
I'm alive!

189
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,344
KOKUTEI...

190
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,348
CROSS!

191
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,373
NOW I'M A PIRATE TOO!

192
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,010
He fell right into a patch of swamp.

193
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,470
That's a relief!

194
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,724
Don't come up again!

195
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,648
HE'S MOVING!

196
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,320
He's still alive.

197
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,951
How careless! Losing to a tanuki!

198
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:33,788
When carelessly sinking into a patch swamp, I must escape.

199
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't come up again!

200
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:39,001
Sink! SINK!

201
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,631
Escape, with a Milky Dial!

202
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:46,801
Wow, he sank fast!

203
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,764
HOW CARELESS!

204
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:57,770
YOSH' I BEAT HIM!

205
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:03,359
HOW CARELESS!

206
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,115
Another Priest's voice disappeared.

207
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,660
This is bad! I have to get to the others!

208
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,624
Hey, what's going on?

209
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:21,002
Engine failure at a time like this!?

210
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:23,170
Come on, move! Come on!

211
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:26,841
It's my first time using it, and now i have to repair it?

212
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,884
I can't do that...

213
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,371
HELP!

214
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:08,090
PLEASE, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

215
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,178
Father, please hurry!

216
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:15,431
I know. Please hang on tight!

217
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,808
Conis-san, here we go!

218
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:18,309
Okay!

219
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:27,693
Now, Conis-san!

220
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:28,194
Okay!

221
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,905
Here! Grab my hand!

222
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:44,710
My, that was certainly dangerous.

223
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,796
It's alright now.

224
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:49,131
You're a Shandian child, aren't you?

225
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,762
You don't have to be afraid.

226
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:55,739
We won't...

227
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:57,648
I'm not afraid!

228
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:02,561
I'm a warrior of Shandra!

229
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:11,070
Her name is Suu. It looks like she likes you.

230
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,946
Suu?

231
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,953
My name is Conis.

232
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:23,959
Hello. Please call me Pagaya. I'm sorry.

233
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,459
And what's your name?

234
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,461
I'm Aisa.

235
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:30,461
Hey, I'm sorry to ask after you saved me, but...

236
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,859
Could you take me to Upper
Yard as fast as you can?

237
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:40,516
Even as we speak, everyone's
voices are disappearing.

238
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,017
I'm telling the truth!

239
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:45,187
Even from this far away, I can hear their voices.

240
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,897
So many voices.

241
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,443
Actually, we're already headed to Upper yard.

242
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:58,158
We thought that we should guide the pirates from the Blue Sea out of Skypiea.

243
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,578
You mean the guys who were on that ship?

244
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,204
Yes.

245
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:05,207
They're trying to get out of the forest right now.

246
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,419
Do you know where their ship is?

247
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah.

248
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,171
Father!

249
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:15,467
Yes. I'm sorry, but please take us there.

250
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,011
Sure...

251
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,186
I finally became a pirate!

252
00:21:26,186 --> 00:21:29,106
Instead of looking for everyone, I'll search for the gold!

253
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:30,733
I'll surprise the hell out of them.

254
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:37,156
That place looks suspicious to me.

255
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:42,036
Maybe... everyone's over there.

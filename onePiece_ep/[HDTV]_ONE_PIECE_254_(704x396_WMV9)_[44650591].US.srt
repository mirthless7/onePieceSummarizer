1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,950
One was hot…

2
00:00:19,883 --> 00:00:21,083
Thank you…

3
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:26,550
Look at, even the large table of information which
was anchored on the ground was made carry by the waves.

4
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,483
What a force!

5
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,550
The speed of the waves of this Aqua Laguna…

6
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:35,283
is abnormal!

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,750
I see!

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,383
Thus had Sanji gone to the station?

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:47,482
Before continuing Umi Ressha,
it is necessary at all costs to find Luffy and Zoro.

10
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,016
Yosh, it is included/understood.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,016
Help us, please!

12
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:54,150
The guy! I count on you!

13
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:59,850
JERRY AURORA FLICKER JAB !

14
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:03,050
DROP KICK!

15
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:05,350
Which waste of time.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,250
SKEWER!

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,150
Where are you, Straw hat!?

18
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,483
Please, answer!

19
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:20,950
Hey, look at-look at-looks at!

20
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,082
Ah, the pirate big sister!

21
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,150
Hey, looks by here! Y' has a trick there!

22
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:28,750
A trick?

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,416
Wouldn't this be Straw hat?

24
00:01:42,883 --> 00:01:45,949
Your Lord of the Pirates?

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,883
What?

26
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,283
This imbecile…

27
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:56,016
He, you? Where you like that run?!

28
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,416
Does not go in the low city!

29
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,549
You want to die?!

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,083
Aqua Laguna arrives!

31
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,683
Return!

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,416
It is terrible! The pirate girl descended the staircases!

33
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,083
He, return!

34
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,283
The sea will absorb you!

35
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,015
Wait!

36
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,149
Does not go in the low city!

37
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,550
Do not continue it!

38
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,549
Paulee-san.

39
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,082
Y outward journey with several will not change anything.

40
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,416
But…

41
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,416
It is the sea which faces us.

42
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,483
You would finish drowned.

43
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,950
If it occurs anything, I will intervene.

44
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,616
You, you do not move from here.

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,150
It was thrown in the low city!

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,216
That fout tokens.

47
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:10,350
Then Straw hat is over there.

48
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:25,016
The HEART OF NAMI SHOUTS!
REBIRTH OF LUFFY!

49
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,615
How can it still run?

50
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,149
Which girl…

51
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,283
Imbecile, it is not the moment to be amazed!

52
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,615
Oï! Return immediately!

53
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,883
You will drown you!

54
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,883
A sea anemone…

55
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,483
Sea anemone…

56
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,616
A sea anemone which exceeds of a chimney…

57
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,416
Why a sea anemone?

58
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,383
Sea anemone…

59
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,683
Wait, the reindeer! Remain here!

60
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,483
Zoro!!

61
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:38,283
Nico Robin very dropped to negotiate with the CP9.

62
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:42,883
Because with you, it would not have
ever been able to carry out its dream.

63
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:49,683
I could authorize the 6 members of the crew of the Straw hat, me excluded, to leave this island alive…

64
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,683
even if I must for that awake
the weapon and to destroy the world.

65
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:57,216
Robin, wait!

66
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:01,150
One will fight against no matter whom!

67
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:04,483
Robin!!

68
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:34,616
Be brilliant for you, pirate big sister!

69
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,483
What a unconsciousness!

70
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,483
It is too late!

71
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,816
Look at the sea!

72
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,950
The wave is already there!

73
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,215
Good blood! They will die!

74
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,950
One can nothing any more make!

75
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:01,883
Zoro!

76
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,283
Zoro!

77
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,016
You hear me? It is me!

78
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,683
Chopper?

79
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:18,816
It is useless, I cannot advance more.

80
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,150
LUFFY!!

81
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,083
HEY!! BUT WHAT YOU INSANE?!!

82
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,416
Gnaa- Gnami! It is you there dirrière?!

83
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:24,682
Gnii- Oï! You hear me well?

84
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:28,082
It is standard Li with the pigeon which has me jity until there…

85
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:32,283
Then semi ji am found wedged here!

86
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:46,615
DECREE TO MAKE the IMBECILE
IN ONE SIMILAR MOMENT!!

87
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:50,816
WHILE YOU PENDOUILLAIS,
ROBIN WAS MADE REMOVE!!

88
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:58,150
To save our lives, Robin chose…

89
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,283
to sacrifice his!

90
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,816
While delivering itself to the government, Robin received in
exchange the promise which it will not attack us.

91
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:26,950
I do not have nowhere where to go, and nowhere where to return.

92
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,616
Not, it is finished.

93
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,950
We will be re-examined never again.

94
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,616
It knew very well that it
would be carried out if it were delivered.

95
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,216
Then Robin…

96
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,950
we had lied well…

97
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,616
Oh thank you…

98
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:59,550
Do not worry you!

99
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,550
I will not let Robin die!

100
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,416
Look at! Look at this wave!

101
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,483
Is it is what this delirious!?
It is thousand times larger than usually!

102
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:14,082
He! They is really serious there!

103
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,349
He the pirate! Drop and breaks!

104
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,817
The reindeer!

105
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,882
I do not arrive there!

106
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:29,016
How you found yourself wedged in it Zoro?!

107
00:11:29,017 --> 00:11:30,283
Stop drawing!

108
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,817
What one makes?!
The large wave is too much close!

109
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,550
That exceeds me…

110
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:49,416
He… wait a little… say to me…

111
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,083
Would not have you Kitetsu by chance?

112
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:54,417
Hein? The saber? Yes, I have it!

113
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,016
How you know it?

114
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:57,882
I feel it, only him…

115
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,617
Because it is cursed.

116
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:01,750
Then you had kept it to me.

117
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,883
Thank you… it slips by to me, grouille!

118
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:06,882
Flee quickly!

119
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:10,083
In height! Climb highest possible!

120
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,949
Too much late, they will not arrive there!

121
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,482
He, the pirate!

122
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,017
You will be carried!

123
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,217
AQUA LAGUNA!!

124
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:42,617
It is what that?

125
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,950
Good-bye.

126
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:05,883
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

127
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:12,883
MUGIWARA-TEAM

128
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,950
Aqua Laguna is too much large!

129
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,483
It is what that?

130
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,550
Too much late!

131
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,816
What?!

132
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:07,417
It exploded all the building!

133
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,416
Zoro!

134
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,017
Deviated, Chopper!

135
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:36,150
But it is which these guys?!

136
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,150
One goes there, Nami!

137
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,350
It is what that?

138
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:50,150
Cling, Zoro!

139
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,083
The low city…

140
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:05,617
Shit!

141
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,817
He! Look at!

142
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,217
It is them!

143
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,283
Super! Brilliant!

144
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:42,549
Well, they are in safety here.

145
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,083
The waves cannot go up high any more.

146
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,682
Cheer the guy!

147
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:48,217
You are too strong!

148
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:15,082
THAT ALL BATTERED UP TO NOW!!

149
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,416
And the crew of the Straw hat?!

150
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,617
Would Aqua Laguna have absorbed them?

151
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,617
Not! Look at!

152
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,283
Paulee-san!

153
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,350
Shit!

154
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,882
Not yet, run!

155
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:04,217
Sink at the high city!

156
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,283
Quickly!!

157
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:09,350
The large bridge crumbles!

158
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:42,350
Which monstrous wave…

159
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,683
Incredible! One is in the high city…

160
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,417
and one is not even in safety!

161
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:52,283
Look at, the sea withdraws itself.

162
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,150
Obviously!

163
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,883
It will strike one second time…

164
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,082
then third once…

165
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,683
with the same force!

166
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,083
It is necessary to be put at the higher shelter!

167
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:12,682
Good blood, which band of cracked…

168
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:15,950
Thank you. You saved us, Mister with the cords.

169
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,617
That fout tokens! It is thus that Aqua Laguna?

170
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,750
I still tremble about it…

171
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,183
If the waves were so strong each year,
this island would have disappeared for a long time.

172
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:29,883
This one was exceptional.

173
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:32,617
You are really fantastic!

174
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:35,217
You had chance of you to leave there.

175
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,617
Granny head of shark!

176
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,283
You were also on the island?

177
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:41,017
Of course!

178
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:45,283
If I had been right in the middle of the sea,
I would have died drowned!

179
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:48,350
He, Mister the Pirate!

180
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,250
You super stays! The “Badaboum” too!

181
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,817
Ah yes.

182
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,150
YOU WANT Me TO CHOKE OR WHAT?!

183
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:03,483
Cretin… it disappeared… on my head…

184
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,217
Hein?

185
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:09,617
With the Zoro fact. Why tested you
to escape the waves too you?

186
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,417
You stays in bottom?

187
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,750
Hein? Ben, nothing important…

188
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:15,883
It was wedged in a chimney.

189
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,083
Wedged in a chimney?

190
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,149
Zoro be really too null for you!

191
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,483
But how you ace makes your account?!

192
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,949
It IS NOT the SORROW TO PLAY IT to YOU YOU!!

193
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,683
You are really too idiots you two!

194
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,283
And where are Sanji and U…

195
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,417
Where is Sanji?

196
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,883
It is true. I have many things to say to you.

197
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,483
Also listen, Zoro.

198
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,217
I could not dream of more beautiful occasion.

199
00:19:53,483 --> 00:20:00,283
I have the exceptional authorization to call upon five vice-admirals and ten men-of-war, Buster Call.

200
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:07,683
Thanks to Ao Kiji, the CP9 received the right to make use of it.

201
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,817
Isn't this, Funkfreed?

202
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:17,350
The woman that the government
world sought during 20 years…

203
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:22,217
Nico Robin, fell easily
in the hands of the CP9…

204
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:29,350
Just like the man who holds the plans of Pluto,
the apprentice of Tom, this foutu Cutty Flam!

205
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:36,083
The world is however immense, but both only
people able to awake the old weapon…

206
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:41,283
are on board Umi Ressha, and move towards me.

207
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:46,950
A weapon so powerful that it could
to destroy the world… will fall into my hands.

208
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,417
It is time.

209
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,749
I am there, Robin-chwaaan!!

210
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,483
Your chevalier servant arrives!

211
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,482
Then was Nico Robin sacrificed for us?

212
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:22,683
Yes.

213
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,950
The other cock and Usopp are with it.

214
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:30,017
What does one make, Capitaine?

215
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,817
What good is it to reflect?

216
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,017
One takes a boat and one continues them!

217
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,883
There are not really the choice.

218
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,950
Allons-y.

219
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:02,950
Let us save Robin!

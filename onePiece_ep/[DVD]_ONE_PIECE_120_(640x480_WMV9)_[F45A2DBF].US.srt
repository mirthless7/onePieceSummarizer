1
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:42,940
The battle is finished!

2
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:42,940
Kohza tightens the drapeau blanc

3
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,200
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,860
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,930
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,300
Crocodile, while trying to discover where Ponéglyphe is,

7
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,020
announced that a gun would draw on the palate.

8
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,880
Will Arabasta fall in ruin?

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,310
Or will it reach a durable peace?

10
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,950
The sand glass of the destiny…

11
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,270
… again the countdown started again

12
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,520
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

13
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,660
They… they are there?

14
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,600
Wait, Chaka-Sama!

15
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,360
Who are you?

16
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,890
It is you!

17
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,730
The Tsumegeri guards!

18
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,480
Guards of elite of the kingdom of Arabasta:
The Tsumegeri guards

19
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,010
You stop all!

20
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,830
Do not attack this man!

21
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,290
They made a breach in the doors!
They is the Tsumegeri guards!

22
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,400
Our large warriors of elite!

23
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,540
Save the King and Vivi-Sama!

24
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,520
Your Highness!

25
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,570
We four swore to protect you until death!

26
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,170
We have of another choice only to attack it!

27
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,610
Since we must face one of Shichibukai,

28
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,500
we do not have any hope of an equitable fight.

29
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,920
Us four…

30
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,210
… will put an end to it…

31
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,560
… good once for all.

32
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,740
You seem to be rather popular.

33
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,930
You four.

34
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,170
I will let to you live if you release from there.

35
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,640
We will not do it.

36
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,390
There is a reason with that!

37
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,080
A reason?

38
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,560
If you are in the beginning…

39
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,630
… of this rebellion…

40
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,280
These contusions!

41
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,970
Me known as step…!

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,060
I can?

43
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,460
Not, it is useless.

44
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,640
Unimportant insects.

45
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,250
Impossible…

46
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,860
Chaka, there is something which bell with them.

47
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,040
They…

48
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,480
To obtain a temporary increase in their force,

49
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,950
they drank the water which destroys the life!

50
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,290
They drank prohibited water!

51
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,530
They have nothing any more but a few minutes to live!

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,420
Nothing can any more save them!

53
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,640
Not!

54
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,310
I knew that you would do that.

55
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,780
You sacrificed your lives to fight me.

56
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,980
Chaka-Sama…

57
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,140
Forgive us our selfishness.

58
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,180
But we must show him
… the pain of this country.

59
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,250
Imbeciles…

60
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,220
We must show him…

61
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,850
… the anger of this country!!!!!!!!

62
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,300
GOES IN HELL!!!

63
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,730
It is not malignant of your share.

64
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,110
You should have more regard for your lives.

65
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,820
But I think that it is too late for you to say it!

66
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,950
If you decided to die,

67
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,780
I, isn't this does not even need to fight you?

68
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,390
You will not even fight them?

69
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,160
Cha… ka-Sama…

70
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,510
I never saw such a lamentable table!

71
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,730
Inhuman…

72
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,690
Dumb!

73
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,100
Chaka!

74
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,470
Chaka! Stop!

75
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,920
You should not die!

76
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,420
Oh, Zoan.

77
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,110
Fruit Inu Inu!

78
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,110
Inu = Dog

79
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,710
Model:Jackal!

80
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,800
Thus you also…

81
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,940
… you want to die…

82
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,710
… for the others?

83
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,500
Alubarna:Northern block - Building of the Medi Government:Main street

84
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,090
Shit…

85
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,090
I lost too much blood…

86
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,640
I have chance, the wounds are not too deep.

87
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,880
But… always… wounded…

88
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,440
How they make, the others?

89
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,850
Nobody would have died better…

90
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,200
I want to know what occurred…!

91
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,620
What?!

92
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,090
You had me of a beat of lashes!?

93
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,660
But it is a cha- meau!

94
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,310
Do not underestimate my force!

95
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,530
You ace have a chance with the short straw.

96
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,470
Stop feeling sorry for you.

97
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,740
Perfect! I will do it!

98
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,480
But promise to me a thing!

99
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,190
If I am made have,

100
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,760
come and saves me, please!

101
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,800
Cretin.

102
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,050
I save only the Lady.

103
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,070
Usopp…

104
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,420
He Usopp!

105
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:40,980
You…

106
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,520
What you ace with chialer?

107
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,460
Who cries? I do not cry!

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,940
When somebody says that another cries, it is that it is him which cries!

109
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,250
Anything, that wants nothing to say!

110
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,050
But…

111
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,700
This old witch…

112
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,140
… said…

113
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,930
… how Luffy died!

114
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,580
It is for that…

115
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,090
Was El- it serious???

116
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,900
You will not believe it, the guy?

117
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,200
Of course that not!

118
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,510
Large moron!

119
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,350
Me too!

120
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,400
I did not believe a second there!

121
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,270
I included/understood!

122
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,350
Let us turn over to the palate as quickly as we can it!

123
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,930
Mouchez you!

124
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,450
At least until one finished speaking about this battle.

125
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,630
Do not swallow it!

126
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,290
Thank you you all!

127
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,020
It is a little early for the thanks.

128
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,950
It is true.

129
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,160
If you want to thank the pirates…

130
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,210
show us the goods…

131
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,590
How much do you want to extort from this country!?

132
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,380
Is it well?

133
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,950
Did Nami succeed in fleeing?

134
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,790
Alubarna:Northern block/Building of the Medi Government:Lost lane

135
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,980
I finally removed it.

136
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,020
If it is for that, I can use it only once.

137
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,480
The large one of the rebellious army is here.

138
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,800
The situation changed…

139
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,050
But despite everything, I must arrive at the palate.

140
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,930
And for Vivi?

141
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,850
It would be said that started!

142
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,290
Listen, Vivi-Chan.

143
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,220
Remember that:

144
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,220
After the combat, he eats enormously.

145
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,730
Yes…

146
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,050
WE WILL AWAIT You has ALUBARNA!!!

147
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,080
Ouais!!!

148
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,420
Well, ducks!

149
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,110
One will go there!

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,760
Go!

151
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,280
Appointment with the palate of Alubarna!

152
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,250
CHAKA!

153
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,940
To be so weak…

154
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,950
… is a sin.

155
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,720
Vivi!

156
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,520
Bombardment of the palate
Time remaining:25 minutes

157
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,570
Kohza!

158
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,620
How…

159
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,710
I see, you used the old secret entry.

160
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,500
Do my eyes mislead me?

161
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,260
I came to tell the royal army to capitulate… But…

162
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,630
Chaka…

163
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,940
… and the King…

164
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,180
… die in the hands of the hero of our country.

165
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,530
I cannot believe in it…

166
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,060
Isn't this amusing?

167
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,280
The battle always made there rage.

168
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,610
And the leaders of the two camps meet here.

169
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,420
This war became a fight to the death between two lizards without head!

170
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,300
You seem disturbed.

171
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,540
This reaction appears normal.

172
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,150
It is very simple.

173
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,250
Try to imagine worst scenario, you will not be very far…

174
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,070
Do not doubt him.

175
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,690
Kohza.

176
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,190
Do you like this country?

177
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,940
Yes! It is the country where I was born.

178
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,620
I do my better.

179
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,420
Kohza, listening…

180
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:44,970
Vivi!

181
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,350
Who stole the rain of this country?

182
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,640
It is all…

183
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,610
It was me, Kohza.

184
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,220
All that you believed to do for the King…

185
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,270
… was scheme by my organization.

186
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,940
You nicely worked all for me lasting these two last years.

187
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,810
Even while the royal family and the royal army hopelessly tried to uncover us.

188
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,360
You would be happy death by being unaware of it.

189
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,170
DO NOT LISTEN, KOHZA!!!

190
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,990
Majesty…

191
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,520
You can stop it.

192
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,060
Save as much world than you can!

193
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,320
In less than one half an hour,

194
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,990
the palate will disappear in an enormous explosion!

195
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,270
WHAT!?

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,010
You are still in life?

197
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,520
GROUILLE!!!

198
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,820
NOT!!!

199
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,160
Vivi!

200
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,650
Release me, Vivi!!

201
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,820
What do you make?

202
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,810
The palate will become a battle field!

203
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,960
It will be bombarded!

204
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,390
I will prevent that!

205
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,570
I will not let it become a battle field!

206
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,960
You are still shocked, you do not have the clear ideas.

207
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,920
If you say to everyone that the palate will be bombarded, that do you think that it will arrive?

208
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,470
It will be total panic with the palate!

209
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,220
Then…

210
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,610
It will be a war without end!!!

211
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,350
Nobody will be saved!!!

212
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,260
You do not believe?

213
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,540
Good deduction.

214
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,940
We must make as at the beginning!!!

215
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,850
We must put an end to this rebellion!!!

216
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,870
And now…

217
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,450
… you are the only one with being able to do it!

218
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,650
Vivi…

219
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,800
You believed that I was going to remain there stupidly and to look at to you making?

220
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,260
Chaka!

221
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,060
I…

222
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,710
… am the protective spirit of Arabasta! The jackal!

223
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,880
That which eliminates the enemies from the royal family!

224
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,520
As long as there will remain to me a breath of life,

225
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,010
I will fight!

226
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,190
It is this kind of anybody whom one calls of the idiots.

227
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,330
How you two!

228
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,750
I can retain it a few minutes!

229
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,240
Chaka…

230
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,510
The chief of the clan of Sandy does not seem very courageous.

231
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,760
Eh well! What doesn't go!?

232
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,760
IEA…!

233
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,620
Why you did that?
I am not an adult!

234
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,150
Go ahead gently!

235
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
What doesn't go?

236
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,620
I thought that you wanted that I involve you.

237
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,160
The second division, return at the base!

238
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,390
The second division, return at the base!

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,500
The fourth line was inserted!

240
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,960
The rebellious army crossed the central square and moves towards the Northern block!

241
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,600
They will reach soon the palate!

242
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,960
DEPLOY THE DRAPEAU BLANC!!!

243
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,240
I ORDER TO YOU TO GO!!!

244
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,790
ROYAL ARMY!!!

245
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,780
Vivi-Sama!

246
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,750
What did you say?

247
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,790
To go?

248
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,480
If we do that, that will it occur of the country?

249
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,310
He! Look at!

250
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,670
It is…

251
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,460
It is Kohza!

252
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,650
Why the chief of the rebellious army is here!?

253
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,300
LISTEN TO VIVI!!!

254
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,380
We wish neither the victory nor the war!

255
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,210
The battle must finish!

256
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,120
About what he does speak?
What does he want to say?

257
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,370
I will inform the army rebels…

258
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,890
… how this battle was stripped of direction!

259
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,910
We do not have any reason to beat us more!

260
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,800
To continue the massacre is useless.

261
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,960
Appointment, please!

262
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,510
Please!

263
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,380
KING SE FINDS OVER THERE IN FRONT OF US!!!

264
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,480
Look at! We reached the clock!

265
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,020
We arrive at the palate!

266
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,350
Prepare you to draw!

267
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,770
A- Wait!!!

268
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,990
The drapeau blanc?

269
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,160
The royal army…

270
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,300
The drapeau blanc! They go!

271
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,180
Kohza-San!

272
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,440
It is Kohza-San!

273
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,380
Why is Kohza-San here!?

274
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,890
Kohza-San…

275
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,310
Why…

276
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,280
The battle is finished!

277
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,130
All rebels…

278
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,010
Calm your anger and deposit your weapons!

279
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,790
The royal army does not wish to fight longer!

280
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,600
Stop, please…!

281
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,830
Really, Kohza-San?

282
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,170
Yes!

283
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,160
The war is…

284
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,770
KOHZA!!!

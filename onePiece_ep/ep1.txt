We ask the same question!

He'll catch cold sleeping there.

It's your fault!

Don't you know we're pirates?

We act this way!

Well?

I'm hungry!

Got any food?

Listen to me!

You runt!

Go to hell!

What're you doing?

Who are you?

Me?

I'm Monkey D.

Luffy, at you service!

What?

What happened?

What's the matter with him?

Run!

Quickly!

If they find you here, you'll die!

But I'm hungry.

You're in mortal danger!

They got a g*ng on the deck!

Oh yeah?

It's great!

The most dangerous place might be the most safest.

What should I eat first?

That box!

Yes!

That's right!

Looks good!

I'm Koby!

You're Luffy, aren't you?

You're good!

How did you do it?

This is good!

Isn't this a pirate ship?

No, it isn't.

This ship was h*jacked by Miss Alvida.

So what?

Is there a boat on this ship?

I think so.

My boat got swallowed up.

Oh?

That whirlpool?

You survived it?

Yes!

I was shocked, If you can believe that!

Are you a companion of those pirates?

It's the most miserable day of my life I was on my way fishing, taking a boat offshore Huh?

And somehow, I boarded a pirate ship!

The next year, They didn't k*ll me they kept me as a sl*ve.

You're not only stupid, you're also an idiot!

Don't say it like that.

Why didn't you run away?

It's impossible!

No way!

If I were caught, what will happen?

I'm so afraid to think of that!

You're a wuss!

You make me sick!

Hey!

Don't just stand there!

Move all of those before the navy gets here!

Or you can have the taste of my Iron Mace!

A good haul!

so much fortune on this ship!

Don't fool around!

beware of Miss Alvida's Iron Mace!

It would be painful!

Nobody can take that!

Miss Alvida!

Yes?

Something came up!

What do you mean?

The barrel There is a monster!

What did you say?

Not you!

We mean there is a monster in the barrel!

Maybe a bounty hunter!

What?

I think you're right I wish I have the courage to drift in a barrel.

I would like to do something.

By the way Luffy, why are you traveling?

I want to be the King of Pirates!

Oh!

The King of Pirates?

Yeah!

Is it true?

Of course!

Luffy, are you a pirate too?

Yes!

How about your companion?

No one!

I'm trying to find someone.

The King of Pirates has control of the whole world!

It also means a treasure of fortune, fame and power!

The lucky person with the "One Piece"!

Oh!

"Oh"?

What "oh"?

All the pirates are looking for that treasure!

That's my goal, too!

No way!

No way!

Absolutely No way!

How can it be possible for you to stand on the top?

No way!

No way!

Why did you do that?

I wanted to do it, no reason!

Forget it; I'm used to it.

I don't care if it's possible or not I want to be the King of Pirates.

I've made up my mind If I should fight 'till I die!

It doesn't matter!

Ok!

I'm full!

I should try to find a boat.

Can I have a boat if I sack them?

Hope they're not so stingy!

I never thought of it that way I can do it too!

With the courage If I should die What are you talking about?

Can I join the navy too?

Navy?

That's right!

To catch some bad guys!

The dream I had since I was a kid!

Can I do it?

How should I know?

Yes!

I should try it!

Being a sl*ve like this, it's better to run away!

Catching Miss Alvida!

No!

I want to catch her Who do you want to catch with him?

Tell me!

Koby!

He isn't the "bounty hunter", I think!

"Zoro"!

"Zoro"?

Koby!

Who is the most beautiful person on the sea?

Of course!

That is..

Who is the ugly and old fat woman?

Ugly and old?

What is he talking about?

Damn you!

Let's go!

Damn it!

Oh, there!

att*ck someone from behind, that's dirty!

Kick around with many, that's dirty!

Get a load of this!

GOMU GOMU NO!

ROCKET!

What?

Luffy!

What are you?

Me?

I'm the rubber man!

Rubber man?

What's that?

You've eaten the "devil fruit", haven't you?

That's right!

I've eaten the Rubber Fruit!

You did?

I heard that before I never thought that "devil fruit" really exists.

You got a good hand wanna gain the prize?

I'm a pirate!

Pirate?

You?

All by yourself?

Yes!

I'm alone for now I'll have a companion sooner or later at least 10, I guess!

Is it true?

You're a pirate too?

A competitor of mine, eh?

Luffy!

Run away now!

Huh?

Didn't you see the size of her mace?

The most powerful one on the sea!

I've made up my mind to be the King of Pirates.

If I should fight 'till I die!

It doesn't matter!

What do you call me?

The most..

ugly, old fat woman!

What did you just say?

I want to join the navy!

Then, I'll catch bad guys!

Don't you know what you're talking about?

Yes I do!

I want to do it!

I want to join the navy!

Join the navy!

Then I'll catch you!

You've just dug your grave!

I'm not sorry!

I'm not!

You heard me!

I'm fighting for my dream!

Nicely put, Koby!

It's no use.

What?

I'm a rubber man!

GOMU GOMU NO!

p*stol!

The sky is so blue Hey!

Aye!

Give Koby a boat he wants to join the navy!

Let him go right away!

Aye aye!

Luffy

-san!

That is the navy!

And it's the right time!

Go ahead now!

I'm a pirate!

It's better to slip away now!

Knock it off!

It's not my day!

It would be unlucky if I was caught!

We got away finally.

Yeah!

That's fun!

Hey, Luffy Yeah?

To find the"One Piece" You must go through the "Grand Line" They called it "The Pirate's Graveyard".

Right!

So I must find a good man Who's that guy?

The bounty hunter?

You mean"Zoro"?

I heard that he was caught by the navy.

What?

That bad?

It's not like that!

He is truly a devil!

Why do you ask?

If he is so good, I want him to be my companion!

Huh?

You're thinking the wrong way again!

Maybe he is a good man Bad guys would be caught!

No way!

no way!

Absolutely no way!

Why did you do that?

I wanted to do it, no reason!

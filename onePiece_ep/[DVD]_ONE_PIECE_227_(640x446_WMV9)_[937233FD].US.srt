1
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,650
He Chopper. Did you find plantes médicinales?

2
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:02,079
I found much of it. This island is filled with rare plants.

3
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,070
There is a thing which disturbs me since one moment…

4
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,290
Which is this strange line?

5
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,020
Can it is true, what that be well?

6
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,230
It would seem that a cyclist passed by there.

7
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,960
We found a zone cleared.

8
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,749
A tanuki?
[Tanuki:left raccoon]

9
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,959
I am a reindeer! Look at my horns!

10
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,370
You are well, Chopper?!

11
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,770
Who it is this guy?

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
Doesn't something go, Luffy?

13
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,700
Who are you?

14
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,410
Who you are?!

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,999
It is which this giant?

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,780
Who is this man?

17
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,189
Robin!

18
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:03,200
The admiral of the marine base, Ao Kiji!
The threat of a great power!

19
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,580
To be able to disturb Robin like that…

20
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,010
Who is it?

21
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,370
It is a navy.

22
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,190
The admiral of the marine base, Ao Kiji.

23
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,800
Admiral?!

24
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,480
Admiral? A so high rank?!

25
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,340
There exist only three men who have the title of Admiral

26
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,350
(the red dog)

27
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,750
(the blue pheasant)

28
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,490
(the yellow monkey)

29
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,200
Only the admiral commander-in-chief, Sengoku, can give them orders.

30
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,520
He is one of the three plus great powers of the government!

31
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,649
How is what a guy like does to him here?!

32
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,660
You did not find pirates more famous than us?! See elsewhere if not…

33
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,460
Alalala?

34
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,309
C… It is what?

35
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,750
A novel method of dredger! Hello.

36
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,999
How is what you insane, jerk?!

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,260
Pay attention so that you say!

38
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,070
He, of calm the guy.

39
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,690
Did you listen to what I said?

40
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,570
I said only that I trotted myself. You do not ignite.

41
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,250
Summers you… this… good…

42
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,210
“It”?

43
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,020
“Good”?

44
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,999
I forgot… It is not serious.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,329
Your sentences do not have any direction!

46
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,469
It is which him? He, Robin, be sure for you that you were not mistaken in guy?!

47
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,799
It is impossible that he is admiral of navy!

48
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,340
He He, does not judge people by their appearance.

49
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,189
My currency of navy is “a lazy justice”.

50
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,119
THERE IS ALREADY REMARK!

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,170
In any event… good…

52
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,760
Ah, forgive me.

53
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,949
(Yokkorasho is said when a thing is tiring to make)

54
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,360
Then, why did you sleep upright?

55
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:36,020
To make short… I by no means intend to capture you, are without fear.

56
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,700
I just came to confirm the position of Nico Robin after the incidents of Arabasta.

57
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,320
As envisaged, it is with you.

58
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,860
It is really lazy.

59
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,690
It is at least equipped like an admiral.

60
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,329
I will announce only this to the general headquarters.

61
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,180
Because by adding the settings at price, the total reward increases.

62
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,700
100 million more….

63
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,590
60 million more…

64
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,290
79 million, that made…

65
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,859
I know anything of it… I lose myself in my accounts…

66
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,620
Remade calculation…

67
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,919
GOMU GOMU NO…

68
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,559
He wait! Wait, Luffy!

69
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,130
Stop! Stop!

70
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,029
Come here! It is what your problem…?

71
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,129
What good is it to attack it?!

72
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,049
- It is one of most powerful the navy!
I of insane!

73
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,569
We will let it capture Robin?! Species of bastard!

74
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,350
Aiaa… As I already said, I will not do anything.

75
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,319
I go you botter the bottom!

76
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,739
Stop that, Luffy!

77
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,180
Wait!

78
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
It is a navy? So only they had said it earlier…

79
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,310
Who are these people?

80
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,770
He, did not fear.

81
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Wasn't this island, uninhabited?

82
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,820
Not.

83
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,850
They are probably the passengers of the shipwreck who failed themselves on this island.

84
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,700
I had echoes of a report/ratio mentioning these shipwrecked men in the surroundings.

85
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,140
How are they, Chopper?

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,350
They underwent wounds but their days are not in danger.

87
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,160
They will be left there if they follow my regulations.

88
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,619
But they have not eaten anything for six days. They are very weakened.

89
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,239
Sanji-kun and Ussop went to seek to eat presently.

90
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,530
He! One is there!

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,660
They were really hungry.

92
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,619
Do not eat so quickly.

93
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,309
still let us have we much food.
- Yes, we have much of it

94
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,730
Why do you eat?

95
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,320
Although this island is uninhabited, it is not difficult to find food.

96
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,490
Ca was not to be easy if you did not have any experience.

97
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,069
You were lucky sacrament to survive a shipwreck on Grand Line.

98
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,320
We are the only survivors having been able to reach this island.

99
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,090
What did it occur?

100
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,750
We were of return of a culinary visit to Pucchi, the Greedy City.

101
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,810
Then the boat was struck by an enormous frog which swam the crawl and broke.

102
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,860
A frog which swam the crawl?!

103
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,169
Don't the frogs, usually swim the pitch-stirrer?

104
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,589
Ca must be brilliant! I want to see that!

105
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,779
You are sure?

106
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,989
It is true!

107
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,599
[Yokozuna which is the name of frog means in Japanese:Sumo champion]

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,860
Yokozuna?

109
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,090
We then fought for finally reaching this uninhabited island.

110
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,500
We had awaited our rescue for one month…

111
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,280
But whereas we thought that somebody arrived, we did not believe our eyes of them.

112
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,180
It rolled to bicycle on the ocean.

113
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,499
Could He He, how a bicycle…?

114
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,670
Ah, it was me.

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,620
Arrived then a pirate boat.

116
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,030
It was us.

117
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,900
Then you “this”, isn't this is?

118
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,549
Good… Hum… It…

119
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,220
Express yourself clearly! Clearly!

120
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,780
It is true! I forgot! He, stops you saying conneries!

121
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,119
L… Luffy! Wait, wait!

122
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,129
Calm yourself!

123
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,520
Not, but…

124
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,470
As I already said, I did just one strolls.

125
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,240
What, one strolls?! Then does not remain there! Break!

126
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,060
It is not reasonable.

127
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,430
At all events, Luffy wants some…

128
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,560
Ok, I go there.

129
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,030
I return, but before that…

130
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,950
You all… Prepare you to leave…

131
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,010
By chance, I know an inhabited island not far from here.

132
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,840
It is preferable that you are neat over there.

133
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,420
He! You! Do not listen to it! It is a navy!

134
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,410
Where is the problem?

135
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,720
It is true, the navy are the nice ones
and we, isn't this is the malicious ones?

136
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,180
Do not laugh!

137
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,709
Will it help them?

138
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,449
Does it have a boat initially?

139
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,680
There was no boat in the neighborhoods, except ours.

140
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,239
Without boat, nor log book…

141
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,139
How will they join this close island?

142
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,610
Ah, all is ok.

143
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,440
You are not at all convincing.

144
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,350
It is possible…

145
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,390
Thanks to the capacities of this man.

146
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,959
Here, it is ready.

147
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,109
We sufficiently responsible it for food and water for ten people.

148
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,409
It is not in your practices to make the things with half.

149
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,050
Yes, it is our strong point! You surely realized some.

150
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,799
It is honest after all.

151
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,369
What will you make? Do you hope them to trail, them and the loading, with the stroke?

152
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,130
As if I of it were able.

153
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,670
You move away a little.

154
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,249
It is what?

155
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,470
A monster! Probably the Master of the places!

156
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,239
That?! He! Run away yourself!

157
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,289
Pay to!

158
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,030
GOMU GOMU NO…

159
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,280
OLD ICE

160
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,440
A fruit of the demon?

161
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,750
The sea is… cold.

162
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,920
Here capacity of an Admiral of the marine.

163
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,760
Ca should last one week, I think.

164
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,760
You can walk prudently in this direction.

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,510
You will reach the inhabited island within four days.

166
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,680
The weather will be cold. You equip with warm clothing.

167
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,610
Do I dream?

168
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,060
The sea became solid!

169
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,549
We can now cross the sea! We can leave this island!

170
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,620
Admiral-san! Thank you!

171
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,350
It is a miracle! It is a true miracle.

172
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,049
Here, we are about to leave.

173
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,710
Ah…

174
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,280
You had chance.

175
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
Made good voyage.

176
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,360
All the pirates are not the same ones.

177
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,390
How to thank you?

178
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,209
Not only you looked after us, but moreover, you shared your food.

179
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,160
Do not make any you for that.

180
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,930
To help your next improves your destiny, you know.

181
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,300
Made attention that the children do not catch cold.

182
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,140
Food will be preserved as much as the weather will be so cold.

183
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,129
Thank you very much!

184
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,350
I will not forget your gesture.

185
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,580
Pirate with the straw hat!

186
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,540
Goodbye! Take care of you!

187
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,760
It is brilliant, brilliant.

188
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,900
The weather is cold, very cold…

189
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,580
It is the winter here.

190
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,940
I can make iceskate!

191
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,479
Excel, Chopper!

192
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,840
A winter island, that then!

193
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,670
What is there?

194
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,150
Stop!

195
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,229
I am cold, I am cold!

196
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,620
I am frozen.

197
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,970
What is there?

198
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,540
How would I say…? You are exactly like your grandfather.

199
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,150
Monkey D. Luffy.

200
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,800
I became insane…

201
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,400
Or am I right?

202
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,420
Grandfather?

203
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,140
The grandfather of Luffy?

204
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,289
What doesn't go Luffy? You perspire.

205
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,439
Not… This. it is nothing… really… good…

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,580
A long ago, your grandfather me because much of problems.

207
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,770
I came here for Nico Robin and…

208
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,730
In order to know you.

209
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,970
Perhaps I would have…

210
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,640
To kill you immediately…

211
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,170
The government yet really does not know which you are, but…

212
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,400
By studying your last respective, one realizes danger which you represent.

213
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,550
Although you are little, this gathering of gangsters…

214
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,990
Is tedious.

215
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,010
First setting at price on your crew…

216
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,980
Until your death warrant here…

217
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,780
Your progress was amazing.

218
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,190
Up to now, you were confronted only with criminals, but…

219
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,950
That made to you more dangerous.

220
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,299
Why you say that of a blow?! Presently, you said that you were there to only confirm.

221
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,500
With the result that your crew is regarded as dangerous now…

222
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,870
It is you… Nico Robin.

223
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,949
He you! You tracked Robin! I go you botter the bottom!

224
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,800
Its setting at price does not reveal only its force…

225
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,380
It also represents the threat which it inflicts with the government.

226
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,239
This is why…

227
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,820
Although you were only eight years old, you gained a setting at price of 79 million.

228
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,689
You made certainly well comprise you a such child.

229
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,570
You betrayed your partners…

230
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,200
And be been useful to you of them like toys.

231
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
To survive in a medium of shadies…

232
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,570
Was single only to serve your own interests.

233
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,530
Which blow schemes you in this new team?

234
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,810
He, you!

235
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,450
All that you say tends to irritate me!

236
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,209
What reproaches you in Robin-chan?!

237
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,820
- Stops, Sanji!
I do not have anything in particular to reproach him.

238
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,400
If I do not have any maintaining contact with it…

239
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,140
It is because it slipped to me between the fingers once.

240
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,000
It is an old history.

241
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,860
You will realize there also, a day or the other.

242
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,460
When you have to make with a suspect woman…

243
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,900
The time of the regrets is already far.

244
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,080
And for you to prove it…

245
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,050
All organizations that Nico Robin could infiltrate…

246
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,080
All were destroyed…

247
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,470
Excluded it.

248
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,080
This is not…

249
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,410
Nico Robin?

250
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,949
You, you stop that! The past does not have any more importance!

251
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,559
If the past were not forgotten…

252
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,550
How could we travel with a kind of hunter of pirates and a kind of robber?!

253
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,410
“A kind” was not necessary!

254
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,920
It is not the past, but the present which imports me!

255
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,049
Now, Robin is an invaluable companion!

256
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,700
Do not speak like that about our companions!

257
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,550
I see.

258
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,220
You became very popular in this crew.

259
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,070
What tests you to render comprehensible me?!

260
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,880
If you wish to capture me, then do it!

261
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,760
TREINTA FLEUR

262
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,259
Robin, stops!

263
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,560
Alalala!

264
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,580
In would I have said too much?

265
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Which disappointment… I over-estimated you, I believed you more intelligent.

266
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,640
Clutch

267
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,260
It was crashed to pieces in thousand pieces, it died!

268
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,650
NR. Not! It is impossible!

269
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,270
H.hé! We, everyone save!

270
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,310
To make a so cruel thing…

271
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,990
ICE SABER

272
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,890
I did not intend to kill you, but…

273
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,860
SLICE SHOT!

274
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,310
YOSHAAA!

275
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,579
Blasted cook, you put yourself at it, you too?

276
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,150
What did you believe?

277
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,560
GOMU GOMU NO…

278
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,160
GUN!

279
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,730
It is frozen!

280
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,070
They are frozen!

281
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,280
All three, in only one attack?!

282
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,320
Ca becomes serious! If one does not deal with them…

283
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,370
They will catch engelures, the fabrics will not resist!

284
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,689
What do you make, Ussop?

285
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,739
Quickly help them!

286
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,340
It is not the desire which I miss, but…

287
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,169
My body cannot move any more. I am frozen, me too!

288
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,869
You lie! You are frightened too much to move!

289
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,540
- Ahhh! Luffy!
- Sanji! Zoro!

290
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,640
Robin, runs away himself!

291
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,230
Your companions are very courageous…

292
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,150
But you remained the same one, Nico Robin!

293
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,130
You are mistaken! I am not any more…

294
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,949
Robin! Pay to!

295
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,410
Run away yourself!

296
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,770
I am…

297
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,950
Robin-chan!

298
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,270
Robiiiin!

299
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,240
IT IS NOT FINISHED!!

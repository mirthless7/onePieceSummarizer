1
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,190
The winner of the second
test of this return match is…

2
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,724
The crew of Foxy!!

3
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:58,590
You have just lost your second team-member!

4
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,524
And there remains nothing any more but one sleeve.

5
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:03,890
But, you can gain only one team-member per test.

6
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,990
Thus even if by chance you gained it…

7
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,024
No matter what you do…

8
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:12,191
you will have lost one of your comrades!

9
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:20,375
CONFRONTATION OF THE CAPTAINS!
THE LAST COMBAT!

10
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:22,524
Please, Oyabin…

11
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:26,191
Please choose your new recruit!

12
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,357
I choose the reindeer.

13
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:39,858
Iyan… Choppy, I will release myself never again!

14
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,925
Robin!

15
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,725
Do not cry any more, Doctor.

16
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,324
Whoah! One is in the soup!

17
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,190
What will one make, Luffy?

18
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:57,690
No concern!

19
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,591
One will have only to play another part!

20
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,790
Another part?

21
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,791
I do not prefer.

22
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:08,457
I will explain you why the crew of Foxy…

23
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:12,591
is regarded as most extremely.

24
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,257
'' Most extremely ''.

25
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:17,258
You were beaten twice…

26
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:20,058
Known as step that…

27
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:22,057
Right before meeting you…

28
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:26,858
one played five times at the Three-Corner Range
against Kibagaeru Pirates.

29
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:28,890
We were harshly touched.

30
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:32,257
We thus start to miss resources.

31
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:34,625
We reached our limit.

32
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,457
That you want it or not…

33
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,090
there will not be an other part!

34
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,557
It is necessary to know to give up the good moment.

35
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,324
It is because they are refused
combat whose exit is dubious…

36
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,791
how our crew became so powerful!

37
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,725
Why such a silence?

38
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,790
But which weak…

39
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,390
To regard itself openly as a looser…

40
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:05,324
I cannot blairer that a coward
similar claims to be strongest.

41
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,924
Which strategy of deflated.

42
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,857
How can you remain so calm?!

43
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:14,390
I do not want to have to choose between Chopper and Robin!

44
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:16,590
You are ready to give up one of both of them?

45
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,124
Calm yourself, I will not give up anybody!

46
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,858
And how you intend to make?

47
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,924
It is tiring…

48
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,591
Why not all cut down them?

49
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,925
It is right a play… a play.

50
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:37,058
He Oyabin, I have a proposal.

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,290
And if we bet five team-members,
for the next test?

52
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,390
He! Stop deciding all alone!

53
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,725
Not, lets Nami-san deal with that.

54
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,858
What?

55
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:52,124
The goal of the play is to recover
team-members of the other, not?

56
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,057
We, we want these deux-là.

57
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,791
One must recover them.

58
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,257
Therefore, if we gain the next test…

59
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,857
They will join us.

60
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,124
On the other hand, if you gain…

61
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:09,190
we will integrate all the five your crew.

62
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,724
Then? I think that it is an honest offer.

63
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:16,657
This girl has notch to want to negotiate with me.

64
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:20,658
It is true that these deux-là is particularly powerful.

65
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:24,057
This type with the strange tools could be useful also.

66
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:28,791
And to crown the whole,
this type which is worth 100 million berrys.

67
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,524
Yosh!! It is of agreement!

68
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,325
But I will give you more than two team-members…

69
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,390
It will be a bet of 500 team-members.

70
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:42,858
If you gain, you will receive
500 additional team members.

71
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:46,124
Why 500 people?

72
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,524
How Oyabin?!

73
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:50,124
He wants to bet 500 of his team-members!

74
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,924
You hold the bet, Straw hat?

75
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:53,590
I do not need 500 people.

76
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,791
You are stupid or what?!

77
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,324
It is our chance! Why you do not accept the bet?

78
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,524
But Merry cannot put 500 people!

79
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,257
One of fout since one recovers Chopper and Robin!

80
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,190
It does not matter that there are 5 or 500 of them.

81
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,725
Ah… I see.

82
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,390
You hold the bet?

83
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,257
Yes, of course!

84
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:15,257
With the fact, if one of the crews does not have 500 people…

85
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:18,525
The remaining people will be
taken in their descent.

86
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:21,457
In other words, your children, grandchildren…

87
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,324
and great-grandchildren, will be
enlisted to the 500 promised people.

88
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:28,458
They all will have to swear fidelity
with the crew of Foxy Pirates.

89
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,458
… children?

90
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:35,791
Dad?

91
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,857
Yes! What is there?

92
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,790
This bet appears riskier than envisaged…

93
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,990
Considering the circumstances there are not the choice.

94
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,990
It is necessary absolutely that one gains.

95
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,657
You ace included/understood, Luffy?

96
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,658
Ouais! I undertake some!

97
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,390
Free with you to ignite you…

98
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:57,791
But in the final round, it is impossible to overcome me.

99
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,657
Prepare you to join my crew!

100
00:07:01,658 --> 00:07:05,325
You dreams! I will not lose against you!

101
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:09,590
I repeated it to you thousands of times…

102
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:13,391
a combat and a play, are two quite different things.

103
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,925
Foxy!

104
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,124
It is the hour of the final combat!

105
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,925
We will determine the arena of combat.

106
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:30,391
The two captains make turn the gun together.

107
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,658
it is the boulet de canon which will determine the arena.

108
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:38,991
Wait a little! Y' has a trick which bell!!

109
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,990
The arena is defined!

110
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,524
Which incredible chance…

111
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:47,457
It fell pile on the bridge from Sexy Foxy…

112
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,990
Chance? But it is not true! Be weak for you or what!?

113
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:53,524
I will state you the rules.

114
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,857
The arena extends from the point where
fell the boulet de canon…

115
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,657
until in a radius of 50 meters!

116
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:02,925
In other words, the combat will be held
in a circle 100 meters in diameter.

117
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:06,990
Vous.pourrez to serve to you as all
weapons placed at your disposal.

118
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:10,590
Only two combatants
are authorized in the arena.

119
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,857
The arena also extends
in the airs and under water.

120
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:18,125
To fly away or fall to the sea
is thus not eliminatory.

121
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:22,791
FOXY!

122
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,990
During this interval…

123
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:28,190
Pom Pom Fleurs encourage our Oyabin.

124
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:33,058
While on the boat of Foxy,
a combat-spectacle is held…

125
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:38,257
In the stands, memories of the Davy one
Back Fight limited edition are on sale.

126
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,124
Throw an eye there.

127
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,590
One does not want any!
Dispatch you to begin the combat!

128
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:43,057
Thank you very much!

129
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,390
And here are two pin's Foxy limited edition.

130
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,857
Do not buy these conneries!

131
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,724
Euh… Where is your combatant?

132
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:52,725
It is him! Embark it out of here immediately!

133
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:55,525
What doesn't go?

134
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:58,857
But why don't they take anything with the serious one?

135
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,324
They are caught too much with the play.

136
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:03,657
It is heavy, they behave like this Oyabin.

137
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:08,674
Bah… This type wants just to increase its crew.

138
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,257
It is already sufficiently large like that.

139
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:15,524
In any event, all will be well
since Luffy will not lose, Nami-san!

140
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:19,258
I will seek to drink,
I would join you later!

141
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,590
He you two!

142
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:25,591
Come by here, come!

143
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:29,591
Hold, take this with you.

144
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,590
How much does that cost?

145
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:32,057
No importance… it is offered.

146
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:33,925
Oh… thank you.

147
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,324
It is true. Even if Luffy loses…

148
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:44,258
We will remain all together since
we all will be in this crew.

149
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,190
But if that arrived…

150
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:49,757
our captain would not be any more the captain.

151
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:54,725
Since we all would become of the subordinates of Oyabin.

152
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:58,457
The Lord of the Pirates…

153
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,591
will be me!

154
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,257
The guy, turn over to work!

155
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,258
Ouais…

156
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:10,991
Known as… Will Luffy gain, hein?

157
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:17,058
We will continue our venture, not true?

158
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,591
It should be hoped for.

159
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,324
You joke, I hope!

160
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:31,257
The popcorn and the Coke cannot be also expensive!

161
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,524
You are not obliged to take some.

162
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,790
I want 80% of reduction!

163
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,258
The farm!

164
00:10:39,191 --> 00:10:40,657
Is C what that!?

165
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,590
It is your cloakroom.

166
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:46,257
You can carry all that you will like.

167
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:48,591
Super!!

168
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:53,657
One would say more a cabine d'essayage than a cloakroom.

169
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:57,991
There is full with tricks owls here!
I can put what I want, Usopp!

170
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,524
You think what of it?

171
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,258
Does that suit me well?

172
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,658
It is well it!?

173
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:13,391
The preparations are finished!

174
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:17,258
Afflicted to have made you have patience.
The spectacle of first left is finished.

175
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,392
It is the largest event of the day!

176
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:25,325
The gong soon will resound!

177
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:32,925
How each one hurries to join its place!

178
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,724
What is it?

179
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,725
The sky darkens.

180
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:45,925
Nami-san, where are you? Answeranswer please!

181
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,725
Look at where you steps, cook of shit.

182
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:56,124
Two combatants of the final round…

183
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,792
are the captains of the crews!

184
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:01,657
Descend it, Oyabin!

185
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,524
You are the best!

186
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:08,057
First of all on my left!
And coming from the figure de proue…

187
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:09,391
It is the return of the champion…

188
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:12,324
with the 920 consecutive victories…

189
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,924
The man who gains all his matches!

190
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,658
Oyabin!

191
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,124
Our Oyabin!!

192
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,992
The silver fox… FOXY!!

193
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:28,924
Listen to me Luffy…

194
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:31,591
Prepare with becoming someone else…

195
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:36,524
This haircut will make
to leave the monster which is in you…

196
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:41,257
This is Afro which makes the Champion,
or the Champion who makes Afro…?

197
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:45,124
It is still a question surrounded by mystery…

198
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,591
Luffy… while becoming Afro…

199
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,924
The power of your fists will increase!

200
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,791
Are straw hat, ready for you!?

201
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,125
Good luck with you too!

202
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,192
Allons-y, coach...

203
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:01,392
Oh yeah!

204
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,191
And on my line…

205
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:09,724
Originating in East-Blue, it is the captain
of small but frightening crew…

206
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,657
Its head is worth 100 million berrys…

207
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,857
Called the Straw hat!

208
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:18,392
MONKEY D. LUFFY!!

209
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:27,125
Luffy covered the Afro cut to enter on the scene!

210
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,392
Go ahead Luffy!

211
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,791
It is which him?

212
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:34,858
Luffy! Be too cool for you!!

213
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,524
Isn't this?

214
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,791
The two combatants are
entered on the battle field.

215
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:43,391
The straw hat will succeed it
to expel Oyabin of the boxing ring?

216
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:47,191
To recover his/her friends and to preserve his pride…

217
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:51,924
or our Oyabin will put
the hand on all that is expensive to him?

218
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:55,324
Davy Back Fight… a combat for the destiny…

219
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:57,057
will start!

220
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,024
Just after the advertizing.

221
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:06,058
CYB3RF34K-ISO

222
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:13,058
MUGIWARA-TEAM

223
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:24,725
He Straw hat! I like too your style!

224
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:27,457
Burn in hell!

225
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:32,058
I am his coach! Show them your gold line!

226
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:36,591
You can arrive there! Brother Soul runs in you!

227
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:40,057
One does not should have let Usopp be his second.

228
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:42,592
I would have preferred that it goes there seriously.

229
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:47,458
Oï Oï, I am impressed!
It is a really wild style!

230
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,992
Not badly of the whole look!

231
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,924
You would not be played it a little too relaxed, champion!?

232
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:58,324
Take guard with you or you will regret it!

233
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:01,591
The second, you are on
battle field, leave from here!

234
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:04,591
What!? My role of second is already finished?!

235
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,392
Second, outside!

236
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:08,924
Begin the combat!

237
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,391
The arena must be free…

238
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,925
it is thus in my turn to leave from here!

239
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,524
What?

240
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,325
Platforms…

241
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:22,991
Super!

242
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:25,458
They must have too cool machines.

243
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,524
Eh well Luffy with the Straw hat…

244
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,857
Let us have fun, now!

245
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,524
This entire boat is the battle field.

246
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:37,458
You can demolish all that sings you.

247
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:41,925
I have full talented naval engineers.

248
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:49,191
I ask for myself which kind of combat
will take place on Sexy Foxy…

249
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:52,392
who by chance became the arena of combat.

250
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:56,724
Only the two pirates are
remained on the battle field.

251
00:15:56,725 --> 00:15:57,991
Go!

252
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,457
Throw it outside!

253
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,257
Go ahead Luffy! Arrange to overcome it!

254
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:05,857
Pay attention to its ray, its ray!

255
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:09,191
Crowd is into full is delirious!

256
00:16:09,192 --> 00:16:11,257
Will it will recover his/her friends or lose them!?

257
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:11,857
The final combat of Davy Back Fight,
for the profit of 500 people!

258
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:14,524
The final combat of Davy Back Fight,
for the profit of 500 people!

259
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:17,391
A match in a round and without time limits!!

260
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,857
Luffy!

261
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,457
Oyabin!

262
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,524
Foxy the silver fox versus…

263
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:23,924
Luffy with the Straw hat!

264
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:27,657
The destiny of their crew is between their hands!

265
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:30,124
They bet both their destiny!

266
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,925
And now…

267
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,058
The gong sounded!

268
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:37,592
Here me is!

269
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,725
Y' has that my hand which is slowed down.

270
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:54,392
I suspected well that you would choose the force.

271
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,325
Whore!

272
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,325
Danger!

273
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,992
I joke!

274
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:12,658
Luffy!

275
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:19,524
It floats! Even its fall is slowed down…

276
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:23,325
It is for that I said to him to pay attention.

277
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,257
Drop!

278
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:28,258
Beat it, Oyabin quickly!

279
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:34,658
Ooh~ non~…

280
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,857
A problem, Straw hat?

281
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,991
I can finish some, now?

282
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:46,725
Je~ ne~ perdrais~ pas~...

283
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,991
Oyabin began its terrible attack!

284
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,392
Straw hat cannot be defended!

285
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,924
What? He does not even stumble?

286
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:06,792
It is because its reactions are also slowed down.

287
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,724
It was right before taste.

288
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:21,992
My blows do not do many damage.

289
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,724
I know it well, rubber-man.

290
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:28,391
Merde~…

291
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:31,325
Oh, the 30 seconds are past.

292
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,524
Any share of a blow!

293
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,724
Thin, it falls to the sea!

294
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,725
Luffy!

295
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:51,925
Shit, this Noro Noro Beam is more
shitting that what I thought.

296
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,791
But it is what this ray?

297
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:58,125
I would take better step to too much lengthen my members.

298
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:01,125
Where it passed this bastard?

299
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:06,058
Refuse! I will not be made any more have!

300
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:10,124
Show yourself, head of puzzle!

301
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,658
Please, do not take any to you with these ears…

302
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,725
They are slowed down?

303
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:26,191
Welcome on my boat!

304
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,657
This type…

305
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:30,392
Aaaah!! I am touched!

306
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,324
Thus calm yourself…

307
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:37,592
I was going just to make you discover this.

308
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,258
Boulets de canon slowed down?

309
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,924
If you can hold above, then I can it too!

310
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:47,258
I would not do that in your place!

311
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,125
That there either.

312
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:58,392
I had warned you.

313
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,658
Hein?

314
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,325
What occurs?

315
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:15,591
He Robin! Manage to you to see something?

316
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:18,058
I see only smoke!

317
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:27,391
Shit… This type…

318
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,725
It is really botching its boat.

319
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,392
It is only the beginning!

320
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:41,858
They is alarming!

321
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,391
Hein? Pin's?

322
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:46,724
They are larger than that which I bought.

323
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:50,057
Of course! They are larger
because they are bombs!

324
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,525
I see… but then they is dangerous!

325
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:54,925
A bomb which speaks!

326
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:57,992
And now, truth!

327
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,592
Afflicted, Straw hat.

328
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,724
I reinforced my gloves.

329
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:08,125
Moreover, the bombs will explode in 30 seconds.

330
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:14,657
Ooh Yeah! Luffy, works it with the body!

331
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,325
Usopp…

332
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,857
What does it occur?

333
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,057
Sorry, ch' do not know…

334
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:22,792
Stop this comedy!

335
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:38,192
Luffy…

336
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,525
It is not possible…

1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Say a spell in your chest

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,440
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,750
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Singing from our hearts.

18
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

19
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
Negai nara chiisana mune no naka

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Kibou de jumon o

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
Kakereba...

24
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Kasoku shita yokan

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Nanairo no onpukana de

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Issho ni konai ka?

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
Bokura datenshi

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
Yume ni ya o hanatsu no sa

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
Kobaruto buruu ni

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,440
Naniiro o kasanete ikou?

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
Hitomi ni utsutta kanashii riaru o kowase

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,750
Nukumori tsuki no hane o ageyou

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Shuuru na datenshi

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Kokoro kara utau no sa

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,920
Wealth.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Fame.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,180
Power.

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,530
The man who once owned everything,

39
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,110
The Pirate King,

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,410
Gold Roger.

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,440
The words he said before his death

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,350
sent all the people of the world

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,870
out to the seas.

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,750
My treasure?

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,540
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,240
Find it!

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,840
I left everything in that place.

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,890
Men, searching for romance,

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,810
pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,610
The world is now

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,940
in the Grand Age of Pirates!

52
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,140
Just like I promised...

53
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,760
I'll kill you fast.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,490
It won't hurt.

55
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,360
You were safer when you were still stuck to your shepard.

56
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,640
This is it!

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,150
Don't kill him! Please!

58
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,450
We don't need your key!

59
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,080
Now die!

60
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,160
USOPP!

61
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,350
Who the hell are you?!

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,860
The hunter.

63
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,580
I-I'm sorry, Sanji-kun...

64
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,300
I...

65
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,990
I should...

66
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,270
As long as you're alive, it's fine.

67
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
Everyone has things they can and can't do.

68
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,940
Sanji...

69
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,160
You two, look outside.

70
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,070
No...

71
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,930
The Gate of Justice... is opening.

72
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,600
Robin...

73
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,330
If that gate opens and Robin-chan goes through it...

74
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,570
We can't cross the sea through it because of the Sea King nests,

75
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,250
And past that is the Undersea Prison and the Marine Headquarters.

76
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,960
Robin-chan will be completely taken away from us.

77
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,880
No...

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,870
Luffy didn't make it in time?

79
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,290
Let's show her, Funkfreed!

80
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,380
Just up there is Luffy...

81
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,760
Don't kill her...

82
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,740
Ivory Dart!

83
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,830
You can't escape, idiot!

84
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't mess with me!

85
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,710
Now let's go together...

86
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,960
To the gate of dreams.

87
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Leave this guy's key to me.

88
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,880
Changing fighters?

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,340
Doesn't matter to me.

90
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,300
I'll do what you can't do,

91
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,060
You do what I can't do.

92
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,610
Think carefully!

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,270
Read the situation.

94
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,200
If you're here...

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,450
There's gotta be a way Robin-chan can be saved!

96
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,200
Usopp!

97
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,580
I want to live!

98
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,620
What I... can do?

99
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,160
The Scorching Kick!

100
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,630
Sanji's Full-Course of Footwork

101
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,150
If I'm here... we can save Robin?

102
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,540
What?

103
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,940
What do you mean?

104
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,030
Soru.

105
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,360
Go!

106
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,580
Y-yeah! Usopp!

107
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,670
O-ow! My wounds...

108
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,720
Just put up with it!

109
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,540
Isn't this better than getting killed?

110
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,750
You're right!

111
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,570
Tekkai Kenpo!

112
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,570
Kenpo: Style of martial arts

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,490
Ookami Hajiki!

114
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,490
Ookami Hajiki: Wolf Bullet

115
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,740
You're not really that great...

116
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,000
Not worth my time!

117
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,820
Oh, I've got it!

118
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,630
What?

119
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,410
We can...

120
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,280
If I'm here, we can save Robin!

121
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,260
Dammit!

122
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,080
"Dammit?" Can't you do this without getting worked up?

123
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,330
Let's hurry, Nami-kun!

124
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,770
Wait a second!

125
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,150
I've got it, I've got it!

126
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,900
Hey, be quiet!

127
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,090
You'll make the wolf come after us!

128
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,200
Maybe I'll go kill them!

129
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,980
Man, he got me...

130
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,090
Jusshigan!

131
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,430

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,610
Tekkai!

134
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,780
You think that hurt, idiot?

135
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,930
What's with this guy's kicks?

136
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,850
That power where you guys turn to steel is pretty bad...

137
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,070
Rankyaku "Korou"!

138
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,070
Korou: Lonely Wolf

139
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,400

150
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,230
Queue: Tail

151
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,750

Tekkai Kenpo!

158
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,020
Didn't I already tell you...

159
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,870
That your kicks don't hurt me, rouga?

160
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,870
Rouga: Wolf Fang, as well as being a pun with the way Jyabura speaks

161
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,530
Did that hurt, rouga?

162
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,170
Tekkai Kenpo "Rouga no Kamae!"

163
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,170

164
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm the only rokushiki master who can move while my whole body's using tekkai!

165
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,070
Shut up already!

166
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,040
Deuxième Haché!

167
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,040
Deuxième Haché: Second-Rate Mincemeat

168
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,680
It looks like it hurt, but it didn't?

169
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,650
How is it?

170
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,250
I'm impressed...

171
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,750
I've waited to fight a guy like you.

172
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,400
Could you go and save Robin for me?

173
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,740
What are you talking about?

174
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,140
I didn't mention this earlier, but...

175
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,250
Robin is...

176
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,180
My long-lost little sister.

177
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,640
What? Really?

178
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,730
I didn't know, she's never mentioned it before...

179
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,630
Of course she didn't...

180
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,760
But it's the truth.

181
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,550
It happened more than 20 years ago.

182
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
I'll never forget it...

183
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,250
On an island in West Blue, on a nice summer day,

184
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,000
Me and Robin were playing together.

185
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Oniichan!

186
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Oniichan: Big brother

187
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,250
We were really close.

188
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,110
Robin!

189
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,130
We always played together.

190
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,450
How's this?

191
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,060
We were really happy that day.

192
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,430
Until they came...

193
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,610
When I wasn't looking,

194
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,120
Pirates came and took Robin!

195
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Robin!

196
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,070
Bring Robin back!

197
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,350
I never saw her again...

198
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,270
When she finally managed to get away from the pirates,

199
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,480
It was too late.

200
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,200
It's all my fault...

201
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,040
No matter what, I want her to be saved...

202
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,240
But... I can't do it myself...

203
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,160
So...

204
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,660
I'll leave it to you...

205
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,370
Please save Robin!

206
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,210
Yosh, just leave it to me!

207
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,680
I'll take this key and go save...

208
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
Like I'd believe that, rouga!

209
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,980
Robin-chan is your sister?

210
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,940
Idiot, tell a more believable lie!

211
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,620
Damn, you're a lot of trouble, you stupid woman!

212
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,170
Stupid stupid stupid stupid woman!

213
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,610
You're making me tired!

214
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,890
Walk on your own!

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,650
How many times have I told you?

216
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,160
You don't even have a shred of hope left!

217
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,090
We heard a voice earlier, but nobody's gonna come!

218
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,130
Lucci's taking that guy down right now!

219
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,530
It's your fault I started coughing!

220
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,490
You stupid stupid stupid woman!

221
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,540
Stupid stupid stupid stupid woman!

222
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,460
You should understand now.

223
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,190
No matter what you do, you won't be able to go through that door.

224
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,240
No.

225
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,370
I don't care what I have to do, I'm going through!

226
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,540
It seems we don't agree.

227
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,290
It doesn't matter what you do.

228
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,640
I don't have time for this...

229
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,130
Gomu gomu no gatling!

230
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,120
Stamp!

231
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,640
Muchi!

232
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,640
Muchi: Whip

233
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,220
Yari!

234
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,220
Yari: Spear

235
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,050
Did I finally hurt you, ookami-kun?

236
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,050
Ookami: Wolf

237
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,240
Bastard, my key!

238
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,040
You did give it to me.

239
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,540
Bastard...

240
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,500
You still don't get it?

241
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,960
Tekkai-

242
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,840
Bye!

243
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,800
WAIT!

244
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm the one who's supposed to trick people!

245
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
Making fun of me...

246
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
Soru!

247
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,410
Party Table...

248
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,090
Tekkai Kenpo-

249
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,800
Cuisseau Shoot!

250
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,830
Brochette!

251
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,830
Brochette: Skewer

252
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,060
Damn, now I'm pissed...

253
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,320
If you really wanna get hurt that badly...

254
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,310
Fine. How about I show you...

255
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,930
The true power of Tekkai Kenpo!

256
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,140
Tekkai Kenpo "Rouba no Kamae!"

257
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,140
Rouba no Kamae: Wolf-Banana Stance

258
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,320
Roukaru Area Network!

259
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,320
Roukaru Area Network: Wolf-Hunt Area Network, as well as a pun with "Local Area Network"

260
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,440
He sliced the air?!

261
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,120
Don Po Rou!

262
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,120
Don Po Rou: Important Wolf Step

263
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,120
How's the power of a tekkai punch?

264
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,040
It must've hurt!

265
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,970
Geppou!

266
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,390
Rankyaku "Lupus Four!"

267
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,370
Trying to steal my key and run was pretty stupid of you!

268
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm a wolf!

269
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,920
I'll chase you down 'till I catch you and eat you!

270
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,650
What, you were alive?

271
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,380
I don't intend to run...

272
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,140
I don't intend to be killed...

273
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,850
I don't intend to forgive you.

274
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,600
Forgive me?

275
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,130
You're doing that for Nico Robin?

276
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,940
That kind of feeling's only gonna get in your way in a fight.

277
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,340
If you've got the time to pity that stupid, hopeless woman,

278
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,660
You should think of a way to get out of here alive!

279
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,950
Be careful what you say...

280
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,960
When I get mad, I heat up...

281
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,570
You're not even trying, there's no way you can win!

282
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,940
You should be in a lot of pain by now...

283
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,310
If that's not enough for you...

284
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,750
Tekkai Kenpo "Matenrou!"

285
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,750
Matenrou: Devil-Heaven Wolf

286
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,370
If you're gonna laugh, now's the time to do it.

287
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,840
I dunno why you're spinning around like that, but...

288
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,890
What? His leg is red?

289
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,750
The leg of the devil...

290
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,850
Diable Jambe.

291
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,850
Diable Jambe: Devil Leg

292
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,310
A heated-up leg...

293
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,170
Hitting with high speed...

294
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,400
Light?!

295
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,820
HOT!

296
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,590
Has the same power as the devil.

297
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,730
HOT HOT HOT!

298
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,130
I-I'm burnt!

299
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,150
I'm hot all the way down to my bones!

300
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,190
Tekkai didn't even work!

301
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,980
What the hell's up with that kick?!

302
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,040
Idiot, jumping into the air when you're fighting a rokushiki master...

303
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,980
Diable Jambe

304
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,880
Premier Haché!

305
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,880
Premier Haché: First-Rate Mincemeat

306
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,720
Idiot! You're such an idiot!

307
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,540
If you get too cocky, you lose the fight!

308
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,530
It's my win!

309
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,600
Gekkou Jusshigan!

310
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,600
Gekkou Jusshigan: Moonlight Ten Shigan

311
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,330
You stopped one hand?

312
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,400
Too bad.

313
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,370
If you'd gotten in another kick you could've stopped all the shigan!

314
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,570
No, I had no choice...

315
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,950
The last kick...

316
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,330
Is the finishing blow.

317
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,760
Diable Jambe...

318
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,420
W-wait!

319
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,720
Flambage...

320
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,720
Flambage: Flaming

321
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,810
Shot!

322
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,440
Cooking is a gift from the gods...

323
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,380
Spices are a gift from the devil.

324
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,650
Looks like it was a little too spicy for you.

325
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,520
Fine, show me...

326
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,350
The full fighting potential of a giraffe!

327
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,590
Next time on One Piece:

328
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,130
A Furious Attack of Drawn Swords!

329
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,740
Zoro vs. Kaku: Powerful Slashing Duel

330
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

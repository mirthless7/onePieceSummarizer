1
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,560
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,850
The man who had acquired everything in this
 world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,590
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,790
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,280
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,470
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,960
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,140
Those are...

10
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,930
You couldn't possibly...

11
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,570
The blueprints of the ancient weapon, Pluton.

12
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,490
It's the real thing.

13
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,220
Do you believe me?

14
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,250
Hey, Spanda.

15
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,860
What Tom-san and Iceburg tried to protect with their lives is...

16
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,980
Hurry up and give it to me!

17
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,970
If the ancient weapon were to fall into the hands of an idiot like you and let loose,

18
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,700
then a weapon would be needed to be built in order to resist that.

19
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,070
To contain a reckless outbreak is this designer's wish.

20
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,730
It's true...

21
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,860
If you use Nico Robin, then you could revive the ancient weapon.

22
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,410
Even if it's not her intention,

23
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,740
as long as there's a chance that she could be used to do so, then she's a dangerous woman.

24
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,870
But for her, she has nakama that don't hesitate when looking into the face of death.

25
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,690
That's why I'm...

26
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,260
...gonna make a bet.

27
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,520
What are you doing?!

28
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,890
It's burnt to a crisp!

29
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,120
Now, there's no power to resist the ancient weapon.

30
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,820
If Nico Robin is to be taken by you now, the world will end.

31
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,570
But if the Straw Hats win...

32
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,240
What you'll have left, is absolutely nothing at all.

33
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,250
Personally, I'm betting on their victory.

34
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,830
Cutty Flam.

35
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,840
How dare you...

36
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,750
...to my blueprints?

37
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,010
ANIKI!!

38
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,640
ANIKI'S FALLING INTO THE WATERFALL~!!

39
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,300
FRANKY!!

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,110
Oi, you pirates!

41
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,850
Jump into the waterfall with all you've got!

42
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,140
Rocketman?!

43
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,330
IT FLEW!!

44
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,300
Seems like the old times, Tom-san!

45
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,550
I did indeed help a man named Roger...

46
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,960
AND I'M MIGHTY PROUD OF IT!!

47
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm Luffy.

48
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,330
I'm the man who's gonna be the Pirate King.

49
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,900
Really?

50
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,410
Yeah.

51
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,490
That guy Roger was also...

52
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,410
He was an idiot too, wasn't he?

53
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,380
And you helped him out, didn't you?

54
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,630
Outrageously,

55
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,980
the entire Tom's Workers' family are helping the Straw Hat now.

56
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,390
You would've done the same, wouldn't you?

57
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,550
Tom-san?

58
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,460
WE'RE GONNA HIT IT!!

59
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,540
WE'RE GONNA CRASH!!

60
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:06,150
Capture The 5 Keys! The Straw Hats Verses CP9

61
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,030
They came...

62
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,370
Yoyoi!

63
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,170
THEY CAME!!

64
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,510
DAMN IT!!

65
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Come on, you!

66
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,420
If only I could unlock these Sea Stone handcuffs.

67
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,260
Now, I'm setting you guys loose!

68
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,520
CP9!

69
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,820
Pulverize them on this Tower of Justice!

70
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,840
I give you permission to butcher them!

71
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,410
Lucci!

72
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,730
You come with me!

73
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,380
Besides everything else, you need to protect me first!

74
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,230
You got that?!

75
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,170
FUNKFREED!!

76
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,310
That's a good boy!

77
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,860
A Devil's Fruit?

78
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,460
An elephant with a sword's ability?

79
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,850
Nope, exactly the opposite.

80
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,030
It's a sword that swallowed the elephant fruit.

81
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,760
Therefore, it's an Elephant Sword!

82
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,690
Along with the CP9, I have this especially reserved sword.

83
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,300
If I think about it calmly, I have nothing to fear.

84
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,800
Now, let's head to the Gates of Justice.

85
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,650
If you think you can take this woman back, then just try it, Straw Hat!

86
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,600
Franky aniki is okay!

87
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,140
The Straw Hat-san's have finally reached the Tower of Justice!

88
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,310
Aniki's no longer captured!

89
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,150
Looks like he's joining the battle!

90
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,600
That's right, that's the kind of guy he is!

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
Go get 'em!

92
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,870
Aniki!!

93
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,520
Straw Hat, do your best!!

94
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,520
We'll leave it up to you now, Straw Hat.

95
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,780
Oi, are you okay?

96
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,810
Old lady Kokoro? Little ones?

97
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,680
Why the hell are you here?

98
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,110
To have brought something as dangerous as the Rocketman...

99
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,590
Though we were saved thanks to it...

100
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,320
Hey! Oi, old lady!

101
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,250
Pull yourself together!

102
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,730
Oi, please! Don't die, okay?!

103
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,610
DON'T DIE~!!

104
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,630
We got bloody noses...

105
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
You should have more than just bloody noses!

106
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,430
WE'RE HERE!!

107
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,860
Straw Hat!

108
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,520
Oi~!

109
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Monster baasan!

110
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,620
Thank you!

111
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Oi, you guys!

112
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
Hurry and get up!

113
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,800
That was nothing!

114
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,370
Don't compare us to a rubber guy like you...

115
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,890
For people of flesh and blood like us to make an entrance like that...

116
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,810
...there's no way we could be okay.

117
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,770
Everyone's okay.

118
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,740
You guys are a bit strange, too!

119
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,670
Just so you know...

120
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,170
There are some stairs over there!

121
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,170
Let's hurry and get to Robin!

122
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,720
Wait.

123
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,250
What the hell is that?!

124
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,780
Chapapapa!

125
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,430
We've been invaded!

126
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,590
Even if you get to that last room, Nico Robin's no longer there.

127
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,490
Lucci already took her to the Gates of Justice.

128
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,650
Oh, and the Chief, too.

129
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,430
Is that right?

130
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,430
Thank you for that valid piece of information.

131
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,250
Chapapa...

132
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,040
I told them...

133
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,300
What an odd guy...

134
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,680
That's okay.

135
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,830
Where they're headed now...

136
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,890
I'm not gonna tell you how to get there,

137
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,700
nor will we of CP9 allow you to get there.

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,440
We've been given orders to eliminate you guys, chapapa.

139
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,660
Orders of elimination?

140
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,860
You guys will all have to get through us in order to free Nico Robin.

141
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,680
Yeah!

142
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,370
We don't need you to tell us that, that's our intention.

143
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,570
Chapapa.

144
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,390
You have such good spirit!

145
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,050
But, let me just tell you one more thing.

146
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,830
What is it?!

147
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,900
Do what you want.

148
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,150
Thank you.

149
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,960
Then, frankly speaking...

150
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,610
Look at this!

151
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,900
A key?

152
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,440
What's that for?

153
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,630
It's the key needed to unlock Nico Robin's Sea Stone handcuffs!

154
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,080
Sea Stone?

155
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,410
It's a stone that nullifies the Devil's Fruit abilities.

156
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,210
It has the same effect as falling into the ocean.

157
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,780
So that's why Robin was being so timid...

158
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,780
When she's really so strong...

159
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,740
Yeah...

160
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,130
The usual Robin-chan wouldn't be so weak as to be kept captive by these assholes.

161
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,160
It must be eating her up...

162
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,130
I see.

163
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,430
Just in case you guys are able to save Nico Robin,

164
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,030
the Sea Stone is as hard as a diamond.

165
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,030
Those handcuffs can never be taken off.

166
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,380
Chapapa...

167
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,240
I told them again...

168
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,240
He really is an oddball.

169
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,500
If you're still okay with that, then keep going and save Nico Robin.

170
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,670
Chapapapapa!

171
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,430
Then...

172
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,350
GIVE IT HERE!!

173
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,720
Looks like he can use that technique, too.

174
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,730
Don't panic.

175
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,370
I haven't said whether or not this is the real key yet.

176
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,750
WHAT THE HELL?!

177
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,420
j& It may be a key to some other handcuffs~! j&

178
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,530
j& Chapapapa~! j&

179
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,590
...may not be real?

180
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,700
j& In this tower... j&

181
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,500
j& Including me, there are five CP9 members! j&

182
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,280
j& Each one of us has a key, j&

183
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,010
One, two! Come on!

184
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,030
One, two! Dance!

185
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,470
j& and we're waiting for you guys! j&

186
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,350
Then if we don't capture you, take your key and try it out on Robin's handcuffs,

187
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,060
we won't know if it's real or not?

188
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,920
What a stupid way to gain time...

189
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,010
And while we're doing that,

190
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,460
you're planning on taking Robin-chan in, aren't you?

191
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,990
j& Exactly~! j&

192
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,180
I told them again...

193
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,370
In this situation, Robin comes first.

194
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,120
We have to get Robin herself first.

195
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,400
The key can come later.

196
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,080
Just leave that idiot and hurry on.

197
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,990
Chapa!

198
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,940
Chapapa...

199
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,730
You're a smart one!

200
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,090
But if you do that,

201
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,240
then I'll just have to...

202
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,330
...throw this key into the ocean, chapapa!

203
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,230
We're giving you a chance.

204
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,960
See ya.

205
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,290
Hey!

206
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,760
Hold on a second!

207
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,500
Oi, wait up!

208
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,510
Why don't you  wait?!

209
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,380
Just hold up a bit!

210
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,370
Just wait until we decide what we're each gonna do individually!

211
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,920
Let me go! Just let me go!

212
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,810
Calm down, Straw Hat-kun.

213
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,830
Is Lucci that pigeon guy?

214
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,470
Yeah, that's right.

215
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,890
If that guy and Robin-chan are together,

216
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,600
then we should send Luffy ahead after them.

217
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,120
Luffy.

218
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,960
You go ahead and blast that pigeon guy away.

219
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,450
Let me go! Let me go!

220
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,780
Excluding Luffy, there are the six of us here.

221
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,850
From the five CP9 that are here,

222
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,820
we'll grab the five keys that can unlock Robin-chan's handcuffs,

223
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,830
then follow Luffy.

224
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,680
five keys which include the one that will unlock Robin-chan's handcuffs.

225
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,670
Yeah.

226
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,990
If Robin-kun crosses the gates, then everything is over!

227
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,350
Everything is a race against time!

228
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,870
Losing is a waste of time!

229
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,850
Everyone must win, even if you die trying!

230
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,770
Yeah!

231
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,380
Do your best!!

232
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,030
Let me go, Zoro!

233
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,490
Excluding Luffy, there are the six of us here.

234
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,540
From the five CP9 that are here,

235
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,500
we'll grab the five keys that can unlock Robin-chan's handcuffs,

236
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,510
then follow Luffy.

237
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,010
If Robin-kun crosses the gates, then everything is over!

238
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,460
Losing is a waste of time!

239
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
Everyone must win, even if you die trying!

240
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,560
Yeah!

241
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,670
Do your best!!

242
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,470
Go, pirate niichans!

243
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,260
Chimney?

244
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,210
Gonbe?

245
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
Where did they go?

246
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,130
They were just there!

247
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm bound to run into them somewhere!

248
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm not letting you get to the Gates of Justice!

249
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,350
ROBIN!!

250
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,510
A secret passage way!

251
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,410
A secret passage way!

252
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,780
A secret passage way!

253
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,040
A secret passage way!

254
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,950
A passage way!

255
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,130
A bucket!

256
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,200
A block!

257
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,440
A mushroom!

258
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,610
Bats?

259
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,270
I... I wonder how far this thing goes.

260
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,260
I can hear something.

261
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,740
I have nothing to fear!

262
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,220
Let's go!

263
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,310
Help isn't coming for you, Nico Robin.

264
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,090
First of all, they don't even know how to get to the Gates of Justice.

265
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,660
Come out!

266
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,340
Pigeon bastard!

267
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,680
Is it this way?!

268
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,250
Is it that way?!

269
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,520
Which way is it?!

270
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,190
It's that way!

271
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,600
Is it that way?!

272
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,530
It's this way!

273
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,430
Which way is it?!

274
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,070
Is it this way?!

275
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,700
It's this way!

276
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,170
Robin!

277
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,480
Even those guys can't make it here.

278
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,130
What a weird room.

279
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,160
Do this here, that there, then this...

280
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,280
I wonder what they're doing.

281
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,520
Door! Open up!

282
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,630
Awesome!

283
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,130
This is bad!

284
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,270
Before I fight...

285
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,370
Where's the kitchen?

286
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,880
Coup de Boo!

287
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,560
'Coup de Boo' uses up a bottle and a half of cola,

288
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,530
so I've already used up over two bottles today.

289
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,330
I need to have the max amount of three, or I can't fight the CP9!

290
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,120
That room! It seems like a kitchen!

291
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,370
CHAPAPAPAPAPAPAPAPA!!

292
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,350
Fukurou = Owl

293
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,350
I'm the gossip loving 'Silent Owl'.

294
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,470
Do you want my key?

295
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,010
Shit!

296
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,770
Not before I refill my cola!

297
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,470
Chapa.

298
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,620
I wonder what it is?

299
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,800
This dungeon like corridor...

300
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,890
YOYOI!

301
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,800
You damn pirate!

302
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,580
We finally meet, here in the hundredth year!

303
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,730
Hey now, hey now!

304
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,920
Hold on right there!

305
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,740
YOYOI!

306
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
He's so loud...

307
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,850
Wasn't in there...

308
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,370
Not there.

309
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,370
Not in there.

310
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,270
Good, not there.

311
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,380
What's this?

312
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,270
There isn't anybody anywhere.

313
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,450
Well, it's okay that they're not, but...

314
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
I see, so you're afraid of me!

315
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,130
Someone's here!

316
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,280
He's sleeping?

317
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,940
Is he a CP9 member too?

318
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,050
H-He's sleeping with the key out!

319
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,470
Could I possibly be so  lucky!?

320
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,430
A huge chance, perhaps?!

321
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,350
How about here?!

322
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,490
Shit!

323
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,110
No one's here, either...

324
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,950
Please, relax and enjoy yourself.

325
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,390
How about...

326
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,460
...I put on some tea?

327
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,030
e& Yes, please~! e&

328
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,500
You've already drawn your swords?

329
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,300
They're groaning that they wanna taste some blood, so...

330
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,630
Where the hell did you fall from, Zoro?!

331
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,850
Why the hell are you with a werewolf?!

332
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,630
But you're with a giraffe...

333
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,120
I guess they both have Devil's Fruit abilities, huh?

334
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,200
What the hell is going on with the CP9?!

335
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,570
Oi, oi!

336
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,540
Is this place a zoo?!

337
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,060
Next time, One Piece: The Power of The Devil's Fruit!
Kaku and Jyabura's Transformation.

338
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,390
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

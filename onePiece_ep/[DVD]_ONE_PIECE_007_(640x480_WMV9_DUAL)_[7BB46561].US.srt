3
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:03,297
I will chew up his head this time.

4
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,533
GOMU GOMU NO!...

5
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:08,232
Gavel!

6
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:18,446
Be my partner, Nami.

7
00:02:20,383 --> 00:02:24,285
Let's do it for our own
purpose. Let's do it together.

8
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,916
OK. Fire!

9
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:33,755
Here it comes... ack!

10
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,331
(Episode 7) "Grand Duel! Zoro the
Swordsman vs. Cabaji the Acrobat!"

11
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:42,063
(Episode 7) "Souzetsukettou!
Kengou Zoro VS Kyokugei no Cabaji!"

12
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,174
I kept my promise...

13
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:49,066
to come here to clobber you.

14
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:05,760
Straw-hat kid!

15
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:08,763
How dare you come back again...

16
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:12,100
to be here facing me!

17
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,767
Listen!

18
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,404
I just want the map and
the treasure. Nothing else!

19
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,602
Whatever.

20
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,508
You three kids.

21
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:25,312
What are you doing
here? Stay out of this.

22
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,082
This is my fight.

23
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,384
I am protecting my home town.

24
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,457
You guys stay out of this!

25
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,301
How could you do that?

26
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:49,104
How could you
do that to the mayor?

27
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,650
He's in the way!

28
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,408
Good idea.

29
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,811
If you hadn't punched him, he
would've got himself killed.

30
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:59,009
He's better off unconscious.

31
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,115
Don't be stupid!

32
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,036
There must be some other way!

33
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,091
Here goes!

34
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:15,960
Super big nose!

35
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,217
Don't ever say it!

36
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,871
Damn idiot!

37
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:25,673
How dare you say that to me!

38
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,717
Give him the Buggy Ball!

39
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,446
Don't you know when to shut up?

40
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:33,114
Luffy! Watch out!

41
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,349
That little bomb...

42
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,495
Blow him up!

43
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:37,907
...not gonna work on me!

44
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:40,708
GOMU GOMU NO!...

45
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,049
Balloon!

46
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:47,795
Who he hell is that guy?

47
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:50,061
He is not trying to bounce the bomb...

48
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,126
back to us, is he?

49
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,670
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

50
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,514
That evens the odds the little!

51
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,449
Who the hell are you?

52
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,915
What a showoff.

53
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:22,330
Since you fought with the lion,
I had a strange feeling about you!

54
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,132
You're not a normal human thing!

55
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,800
Explain yourself!

56
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:29,370
The air balloon belly
thing! How did you do that?

57
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,306
It's like my belly is made of rubber.

58
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,479
That's what I'm talking about!

59
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:36,135
Are you a monster or something?

60
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:41,874
You got some nerve.

61
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,788
He's using his crewmen as human shields.

62
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,086
I am so stuffed.

63
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,321
What happened?

64
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,236
You are...

65
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,437
Hi.

66
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,175
It's the hat kid!

67
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,577
Captain Buggy. Watch out for this guy.

68
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,579
He has the devil fruit power too.

69
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,681
He is a rubber man.

70
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,849
What?

71
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,808
Rubber man? >> Right.

72
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,788
He ate the devil fruit, too.

73
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,625
No wonder he could bounce back the bomb.

74
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:31,031
This is the most embarassing time
ever in the history of piracy.

75
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,807
Captain.

76
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:35,367
It's too humiliating.

77
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:38,006
I am too angry to talk.

78
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:41,376
Cabaji! What have you done to Richie?

79
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:43,011
The kitty?

80
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,400
I was afraid my clothes would get
dirty, so I used him as a shield.

81
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:48,981
Richie!

82
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,748
Hang on, Richie. Are you alright?

83
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,395
Richie!

84
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,594
Why you little...

85
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,934
Get away!

86
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,530
You get away!

87
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,372
Captain Buggy.

88
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:18,246
What, Cabaji?

89
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,748
Let me handle this.

90
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:23,627
Show them how bad we are.

91
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,894
I am Second Mate, Cabaji.

92
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:34,896
I will get you back...

93
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:37,061
for our captain!

94
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:42,362
If it's a sword flight, I will take it.

95
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,940
It's my honor, Roronoa Zoro.

96
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:49,355
I can chop up a famous
swordman like you.

97
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:55,783
Zoro, you get some
rest. I will handle it.

98
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,985
Keep out of this.

99
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:01,036
<i>Hurt by the captain, right? Stupid.</i>

100
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,459
The Breath Of Death!

101
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,169
What's up?

102
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,805
I didn't think I kicked that hard.

103
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:20,258
That mean guy! He aimed for his wound!

104
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,384
Murder At The Steam Bath!

105
00:08:29,284 --> 00:08:30,918
What kind of circus trick is that?

106
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,230
You're just kicking up dust!

107
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:39,429
He did it again!

108
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,697
What?

109
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:45,197
You are a man. Don't act like a wuss.

110
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,303
Now you know how scary I am, huh?

111
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:54,266
It's too stupid of you to be against us.

112
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:00,063
Is he out of his mind?
He is wounded seriously.

113
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,247
It's a miracle for him to
be alive with that wound.

114
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,561
What are you doing here?
He is going to be killed!

115
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,986
Roronoa Zoro...

116
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,684
Go to hell!

117
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,632
Damn you!

118
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,414
You like to attack my wound?

119
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,693
Then you're gonna love this!

120
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,921
Why didn't you avoid him?

121
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,186
That's enough. Stop
hitting below the belt.

122
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,788
Now I'll show you some real swordsplay.

123
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,329
Cool!

124
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,544
So, Roronoa Zoro...
I underestimated you.

125
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:02,710
My ambition is to be the
greatest swordfighter.

126
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:08,049
I will never lose to anyone.

127
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,917
I got it.

128
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:13,421
It's you dream and
you are trying so hard.

129
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,857
But don't worry.

130
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:20,027
You are severely wounded
and I am your enemy.

131
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,258
It's reasonable for you to lose.

132
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,659
It's the other way around

133
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:29,570
If I lose just because of a small wound,

134
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,039
I might as well give up on my dream.

135
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,204
You scurvy dog!

136
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,705
Go, Zoro.

137
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:41,682
I am out of here.

138
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:46,020
I don't care. Do
whatever you want.

139
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:50,725
What you do is none of my business.

140
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:54,391
I'm gonna get the treasure now.

141
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:59,333
Let's be partners next time.

142
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,502
Bye, good luck on the fight.

143
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,706
Thank you.

144
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:07,403
Let me show you my circus trick.

145
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,969
The Dance of a Hundred Kamakaze Tops!

146
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:21,422
Luffy and Zoro are both freaks.

147
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:24,321
It's always bad luck being around them.

148
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:36,588
Here it is.

149
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:41,071
I will take the map and
treasure and sneak away.

150
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:46,609
And now...

151
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,034
A Hike In The Mountains!

152
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,888
And now, Fireworks In
The Cool Summer Breeze.

153
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,838
Wow! He's way up there!

154
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,501
Sting Of The Unicycle!

155
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:01,496
Chop Chop, Low
Flying Cannon!

156
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,669
Cabaji! I will trap Zoro!

157
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,401
Thanks.

158
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,712
Why you...

159
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:19,590
Luffy.

160
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,651
Damn you!

161
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,871
When Zoro is fighting...

162
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:26,950
keep your hands off.

163
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:55,879
Look at all that treasure!

164
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,748
They are all mine.

165
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,957
What are you doing to my treasure?

166
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:10,797
<i>Soneone found me!</i>

167
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:16,470
Buggy said, anyone
who comes near here...

168
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:20,136
It's empty.

169
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,511
It hurts!

170
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,246
What's wrong?

171
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,882
My chest hurts!

172
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,148
What chest?

173
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,323
Checkmate!

174
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,232
The map of the Grand Line!

175
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:08,755
I don't need the
Captain's help to kill you.

176
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:12,523
Enough. I am tired.

177
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,324
You finally gave up.

178
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:22,633
It's amazing for you to hang on
for so long with a serious wound.

179
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:28,316
I am tired... of your
stupid circus tricks.

180
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,784
No more tricks I'll finish you now...

181
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:37,352
...with real swordsmanship!

182
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:40,388
Go to hell!

183
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:45,481
<i>Oni-giri!
"Onigiri" = Demon Slash</i>

184
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:50,496
Cabaji!

185
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,268
I can't believe we pirates...

186
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,036
...lost to these thieves!

187
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:03,976
We are not thieves.

188
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,318
We are pirates!

189
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:13,052
I'm going to sleep, Luffy.

190
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,927
Ok, leave the rest to me.

191
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,365
It's so much treasure. No
wonder they are notorious.

192
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:28,634
It's making me tired.

193
00:15:28,635 --> 00:15:31,765
But with so much treasure...

194
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:40,571
We gotta get out here!

195
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,528
You said you are pirates.

196
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,764
Yes. We are going to the Grand Line!

197
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:04,703
It's not a place idiots like you
can just go because you want to go.

198
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,941
Why do you want to go to the Grand Line?

199
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,902
And don't tell me for sightseeing.

200
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,014
I wanna be the pirate king!

201
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,920
Don't be a fool!

202
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:24,624
If you were pirate king,
would I be God of the pirates?

203
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,828
Only I can be the pirate king and
get all the treasure in the world.

204
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,863
So forget it!

205
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,213
Shut up.

206
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,821
Come on! Show me what you got!

207
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:44,644
Seeing your hat reminds me
of that man. It's annoying.

208
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:49,149
That stupid red hair man
is a real pain in the butt.

209
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,926
Red hair?

210
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:52,757
You said "red hair"?

211
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,274
You mean you know Shanks?

212
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,591
So? So what if I now him?

213
00:16:58,592 --> 00:16:59,992
Where is he now?

214
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,829
Well, If I know where he
is, I know where he is...

215
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,891
But if I don't know where he is,
so I don't know where he is...

216
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:08,835
What are you talking
about? Are you a moron?

217
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:11,170
Hey! Watch your mouth!

218
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:17,143
I am not a good man and
don't think I will tell you.

219
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:19,184
Then I will make you tell me.

220
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,581
You'll be dead before I tell you.

221
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:26,887
Rubber won't bounce back a razor blade!

222
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,621
It sure can't.

223
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:34,394
Chop Chop

224
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:35,343
Buzz Saw!

225
00:17:37,998 --> 00:17:39,499
You can't escape in the air...

226
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,926
Now you can't get away.

227
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,098
Sure I can.

228
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:51,471
This is getting interesting!

229
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:53,947
Same here.

230
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,622
GOMU GOMU NO! PISTOLET!

231
00:17:57,851 --> 00:17:59,752
What an interesting skill.

232
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,248
It's not quite perfect.

233
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,351
I will chop you up!

234
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,469
GOMU GOMU NO!...

235
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,194
Chop Chop Quick Dodge!

236
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:09,269
...Sickle!

237
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,314
You underestimate me, Gummy Boy!

238
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,569
Damn, you're no fun.

239
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:31,417
What kind of fight is this?

240
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:32,822
I am like dreaming.

241
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,422
Hey, did you see that?

242
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:39,559
Shut up and stay still!

243
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,635
If we get involved, we're mincemeat!

244
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,700
Chop Chop Harpoon!

245
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:49,955
Separate!

246
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,943
Now you know how good I am, kid. Huh?

247
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,125
You bastard!

248
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:11,607
What? You're upset
because I hurt your face?

249
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:17,202
You hellspawn! How dare you ruin my hat!

250
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,616
So?

251
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,000
This is my treasure!

252
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,093
I will never forgive
anyone who ruins my hat!

253
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:30,209
I swore to the man who gave me the hat.

254
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,480
I told him I would become a pirate.

255
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,109
I thought nothing fazed this guy...

256
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:41,322
...but he looks pretty mad.

257
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:48,361
That hat must be important to you.

258
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:49,283
Yes.

259
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,113
That hat is very precious?

260
00:19:58,205 --> 00:19:59,839
Since it's your treasure...

261
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,804
...then protect it well!

262
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:22,359
Shanks.

263
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,396
Your arm!

264
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,512
Keep my hat with you.

265
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:38,940
It's my best hat. Please
take good care of it.

266
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:48,953
<i>You must return my hat someday...</i>

267
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,690
<i>...when you become a pirate king.</i>

268
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:57,127
<i>Promise, Luffy?</i>

269
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:09,836
What kind of "treasure"
is this ugly hat?

270
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:16,049
A treasure is supposed to
be like gold or something.

271
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,085
It should be valuable to
represent the owner's reputation.

272
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:22,855
You said this beat up
old thing is "treasure".

273
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,089
Don't be ridiculous.

274
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,579
That hat represents
my promise with Shanks!

275
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,937
What?

276
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,992
It's Shanks's hat?

277
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:37,637
That's why it looks familiar.

278
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:41,207
He always wears the
hat when I was with him.

279
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,210
You used to sail on the same boat?

280
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:47,914
Yes. When I was an apprentice pirate.

281
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,049
We were pals.

282
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,746
That damn red hair guy!

283
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:57,991
Shanks is a great man!

284
00:21:57,992 --> 00:21:59,892
You were pals?

285
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:02,062
Don't flatter yourself!

286
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:04,798
Chop Chop Quick Escape!

287
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,871
Don't say you are Shanks's pal!

288
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,609
It's none of your business.

289
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,715
Tell me what happened
between you and Shanks!

290
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,918
Damn.

291
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:33,686
What have you done to my treasure?

292
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,731
You really wanna know?

293
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:44,866
I will never forgive him.

294
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,875
I will curse him to death.

295
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:51,284
I will never forgive him!

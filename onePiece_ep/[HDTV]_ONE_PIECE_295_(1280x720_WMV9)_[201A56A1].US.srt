1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Cast a spell in your heart

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,829
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

19
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
Negai nara chiisana mune no naka

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Kibou de jumon o

22
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
Kakereba...

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Kasoku shita yokan

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Nanairo no onpukana de

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Issho ni konai ka?

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
Bokura datenshi

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
Yume ni ya o hanatsu no sa

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649
Kobaruto buruu ni

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Naniiro o kasanete ikou?

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Hitomi ni utsutta kanashii riaru o kowase

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,829
Nukumori tsuki no hane o ageyou

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Shuuru na datenshi

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,990
Kokoro kara utau no sa

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,949
Wealth. Fame. Power.

35
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,229
Wealth. Fame. Power.

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,980
Wealth. Fame. Power.

37
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,959
The man who once owned everything,
The Pirate King, Gold Roger.

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,139
The man who once owned everything,
The Pirate King, Gold Roger.

39
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,820
The man who once owned everything,
The Pirate King, Gold Roger.

40
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,449
The words he said before his death

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,369
sent all the people of the world

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,280
out to the seas.

43
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,120
My treasure?

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,549
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,740
Find it!

46
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,250
I left everything in that place.

47
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,909
Men, searching for romance,

48
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,870
pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

49
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,579
The world is now

50
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,350
in the Grand Age of Pirates!

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,020
Wait!

52
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,640
You... that's...!

53
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,690
The Silver Denden Mushi has received a signal!

54
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,150
A Buster Call has been requested!

55
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,740
A Buster Call has been requested by Admiral Aokiji!

56
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,360
Where?

57
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,880
Enies Lobby.

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,960
Call the five Vice-Admirals closest to our destination.

59
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,109
At this distance, it's quickest to leave from the headquarters.

60
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,340
How long will it take?

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
We can arrive in 30 minutes.

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,770
Prepare ten battleships immediately.

63
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,590
Call in five Vice-Admirals.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,990
Quickly!

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes, sir!

66
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,340
A Buster Call has been requested!

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,680
Our destination is Enies Lobby!

68
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,790
Prepare ten battleships immediately!

69
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,660
Oi! Oi!

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,539
Yes, Director?

71
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,619
Dammit, this is the hand with the little Denden Mushi...

72
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,950
Damn, I was too careless.

73
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,280
Why'd I have to push the Golden Denden Mushi?

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,440
And I just had...

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,250
To call the Buster Call!

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,250
Everyone, leave the island!

77
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,220
A Buster Call is headed towards Enies Lobby!

78
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,180
Nobody on the island will be safe!

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,260
Don't say those things!

80
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,100
A Buster Call was called!

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,730
Battleships are coming!

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,910
Get outta Enies Lobby!

83
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,760
What was that?

84
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,500
Where was Robin talking from?

85
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,000
The other side of this door.

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,970
I'm not going to let you through.

87
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,240
Move.

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Robin's gotta be through that door!

89
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,970
She's there.

90
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,000
You're not seeing her.

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,890
Ever again.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,270
No.

93
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,370
I'm gonna go see her!

94
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,299
I'm going now!

95
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,130
Robin!

96
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:20,530
Counter-attack with Mirages!

97
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,859
Stand up, Nico Robin.

98
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,960
Hurry and stand up!

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,130
What's with that look?

100
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,010
Call off the Buster Call immediately.

101
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,340
It should still be possible!

102
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,429
Shut up!

103
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,600
You're still going on about that?

104
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,620
You expect me, the director of CP9, to say,

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,000
"Oh, sorry I accidentally called the Buster Call!"

106
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,650
Idiot!

107
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,450
Whatever happens, I know one thing...

108
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,609
If I bring you to the World Government...

109
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,619
My future will be great!

110
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,620
Isn't that great?

111
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,440
That will never happen.

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
What?

113
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,750
Everybody is... Luffy is coming.

114
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,800
Soon.

115
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,029
No, you're wrong.

116
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,530
You don't have any reason to hold onto those hopes any longer!

117
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:37,910
Right now, the one fighting that Strawhat is CP9's strongest, with a douriki of 4000, Rob Lucci.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,420
Do you really think that brat has any chance of winning?!

119
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,189
Even if the Buster Call comes, even if Strawhat wins,

120
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,060
Nothing will change!

121
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,430
Do you get it?!

122
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,619
Luffy... Everyone...

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,770
Luffy... Everyone...

124
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,670
ROBIN!

125
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,419
It's a Buster Call!

126
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,250
Battleships are coming!

127
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,120
If we stay here, they're even gonna take us out!

128
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,790
Run!

129
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,230
It looks funny!

130
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,430
But... is nobody coming?

131
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,810
I thought big nose would've been here by now...

132
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,690
It seems like lots of fun...

133
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,110
Chimney and Gonbe...

134
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,130
What are you up to?

135
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,850
Baachan: Grandma

136
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,579
Well...

137
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,439
We found this weird hole,

138
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,549
Niichan: Older brother, or a close older male friend

139
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,049
And then, and then,

140
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,330
Pirate-niichan got really tiny!

141
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,980
Tiny?

142
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,000
But, but, then it went "boom!"

143
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,210
Boom?

144
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,550
Right?

145
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,660
That pirate kid...

146
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,479
I don't have a clue about what's going on,

147
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,490
But it seems like things are getting pretty interesting!

148
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,250
Things are picking up now.

149
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,370
It seems that if we stay in the tower for long, we'll die.

150
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,290
If you're running away, leave your key.

151
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,380
Soru: Shave

152
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,800
I wanted to play for longer...

154
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,410
Crap...

155
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,900
But we have to hurry and escape as well.

156
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,080
Golden Awa: Golden bubble, "awa" is also a pun with "hour"

157
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,500
The attack that got Sanji-kun...

158
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,970
I even knew what to avoid...

159
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,230
I can't hold the Clima Tact...

160
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,549
My whole body's smooth, so...

161
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,160
I can't stand too well!

162
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,490
What did you do to my body?!

163
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,950
Unfortunately, it smooths out your body's curves as well,

164
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,630
But it's the most beautiful skin.

165
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,620
I'm jealous.

166
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,640
On the other hand, your strength is reduced by half.

167
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,090
It's best if you give up on my key.

168
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,640
I-I can't do that!

169
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,150
Cool Charge!

170
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,140
It's no use.

171
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,510
Our playtime is over.

172
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,350
Rankyaku: Storm leg

173
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,520
Mirage Tempo!

174
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,360
I'm over here.

175
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,580
When did you-

176
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,750
How can this be?

177
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,070
Shigan: Finger gun

178
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,940
Another fake?

179
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,330
Where are you now?

180
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,830
Over here, over here!

181
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,170
What is that?

182
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,960
S-she grew larger?

183
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,600
You were also a devil fruit user?

184
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,770
Dumb blonde.

185
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,460
The Buster Call was called!

186
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,760
Hurry!

187
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,140
Meitou: Named Sword

188
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,470
Rankyaku!

189
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,970
Shigan!

190
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,520
Yosh, well done.

191
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,869
Rankyaku!

192
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,760
Shigan!

193
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,470
Again?

194
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,720
Zoro-kun, this plan isn't going to work.

195
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,420
How about I give you advice on a different plan?

196
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,800
No, wait.

197
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,620
The enemy's about to finally get a taste...

198
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,570
Of Hana-Arashi's true power.

199
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,270
R-really?

200
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,110
Using your nakama as a katana...

201
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,090
What a foolish way to attack.

202
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,490
After all, we don't care if he gets hurt.

203
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,380
Zoro-kun, I have prepared myself!

204
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,710
Shall we do this?

205
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,170
This is the turning point, with a new plan!

206
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,830
Go, without hesitation!

207
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,300
Well said.

208
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,059
Meitou Hana-Arashi.

209
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,970
Hissatsu: Sure kill

210
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,240
Makie: Lacquer decoration

211
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,050
A name that brings out the beauty in Hana-Arashi perfectly!

212
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,230
I like it, Zoro-kun!

213
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,770
U-um...

214
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,969
What?

215
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,600
It looks like he wants us to go beat him...

216
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,149
Z-Zoro-kun, what exactly...

217
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,669
I'm gonna go first!

218
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,130
I'm first!

219
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,330
Soru!

220
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,689
Shit!

221
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,060
To think you were just baiting us...

222
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,020
That was pretty dangerous.

223
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,999
Makie: Animal feed, or animal bait

224
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,949
I don't taste good!

225
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,399
You mean I was just a decoy?

226
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,130
What's up with you?

227
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,319
One more time.

228
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Hissatsu Makie

229
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,160
You're abusing me again?

230
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,910
You've got that "hissatsu" all wrong!

231
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,960
I'm the one who's gonna die...

232
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,119
A zoan fruit...

233
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,340
Was that your secret weapon?

234
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,120
I told you that's not me!

235
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,940
But... that thing...

236
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,060
It looks like a reindeer...

237
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,160
And it has that hat, and the symbol...

238
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,960
But, it can't really be Chopper!

239
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,240
Some type of wild-beast fruit?

240
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,320
Geppou: Moonwalk

241
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,040
Rankyaku!

242
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,290
Wait! Stop!

243
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,510
Chopper!

244
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,410
Hey, you are Chopper, right?

245
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,020
How did you get like that...?

246
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,740
You don't recognize me because of my body?

247
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,860
Aren't you Chopper?

248
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,940
Listen, I never thought that thing was you!

249
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,780
Chopper!

250
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,990
She's ignoring me!

251
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,330
Insolent girl!

252
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,330
Chopper!

253
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,539
What's wrong?

254
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,449
Look closely, it's me!

255
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,250
Nami!

256
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,420
Chopper!

257
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,560
Chopper, stop it!

258
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,160
Sanji-kun was at the bottom of the stairs...

259
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,670
I wonder where this creature wandered in from...

260
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,620
Don't touch him!

261
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,250
He's my nakama!

262
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,820
What happened to Chopper?

263
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,490
This is bad, I need to hurry and stop him!

264
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,870
That's your nakama?

265
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,170
Pirates keep very disturbing pets.

266
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,610
Chopper!

267
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,610
Ignoring me again?

268
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,340
Insolent girl!

269
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,260
It's fine if you go to stop that monster,

270
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,500
But I've been ordered to stop you.

271
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,250
It's time for me to finish this.

272
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,760
Rankyaku!

273
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,200
No!

274
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,640
I can't dodge when my whole body's like this!

275
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,290
I dodged?

276
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,290
One of my legs is back to normal!

277
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,180
Why? What happened?

278
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,740
It's wet...

279
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,790
In all the confusion before... Yes!

280
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,200
Water!

281
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,490
The soap power can be washed away with water!

282
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,590
Aren't you underestimating me?

283
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,140
Now that you know how to get rid of the effects of "golden awa",

284
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,640
Do you really think I'll let you do it?

285
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,150
Hitsuji-Gumo Relax Awa: Sheep-cloud relax bubbles, as well as "awa" being a pun with "hour"

286
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,400
I'll blow those bubbles away with wind!

287
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,710
Cyclone-

288
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,100
Damn!

289
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,790
No, my strength is...

290
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,230
Shinaru: Bending

291
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,300
The Tact...

292
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,180
Whip!

293
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,060
I'm saved...

294
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,530
Saved?

295
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,370
When you send me flying,

296
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,080
You also get rid of the other bubbles.

297
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,020
If you like,

298
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,540
I can continue to send you flying until you die.

299
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,170
The weather is cloudy!

300
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,630
Cloudy Tempo!

301
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,680
It's not a magic show like it used to be!

302
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,780
Clouds... More lightning?

303
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,010
Lightning doesn't come from thin clouds like this.

304
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,190
Instead, they'll do something else.

305
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,320
You wouldn't... No, you would!

306
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,060
The weather is rainy!

307
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,499
Cool Ball!

308
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,450
Soru!

309
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,379
Rain!

310
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,980
Rain Tempo!

311
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,630
That's not very nice, after I'd made you so beautiful.

312
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,660
If giving in is nice, then I have to refuse.

313
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,610
Cool Charge!

314
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,860
Mirage Tempo!

315
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,720
She's gone?

316
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,910
I understand your powers,

317
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,580
And CP9's strength.

318
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,270
What is this?

319
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,330
Mirage Tempo

320
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,350
Fata Morgana!

321
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,019
Franky!

322
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,290
What the hell are you doing?!

323
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,300
Stop being stupid!

324
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,620
Next time on One Piece:

325
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,929
Nami's Determination!

326
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,720
Shoot the Rampaging Chopper!

327
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,880
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

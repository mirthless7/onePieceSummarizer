1
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:17,500
FOXY THE SILVER FOX!
AN INTERVENTION FORCES

2
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:23,816
The race was tightened!

3
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:26,483
The coral barrier is right in front!

4
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:29,816
At the head, we find Cutie Wagon of Porch-chan.

5
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,083
Barrel Tiger of the crew of the hat
of straw and My-iikada are behind.

6
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:34,616
Impressing!

7
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:36,283
Ca resembles the horns of Chopper.

8
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:40,150
Which are these long projecting corals?

9
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:43,550
It does not matter their length, the corals cannot
not to be with the top of the sea level, not?

10
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:45,016
Look at!

11
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,883
Ca created a strange current.

12
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:50,816
One must go there calmly.

13
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,683
I would never have thought that the race would go also far.

14
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:56,816
Cleaned, I count on you!

15
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,616
We cannot forget…

16
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:04,816
Come from the right-hand side, our Oyabi, Foxy the Fox
Silver plated, which awaits its chance to intervene.

17
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,950
I wonder what it will do.

18
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,883
Massacre them, Oyabi!

19
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:15,083
Assigned time is almost past!

20
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,416
The boat of the crew of
straw hat loses speed.

21
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,550
Allons-y Nami! Let us row!

22
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:22,283
Not yet!

23
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,283
They widen the gap more!

24
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,550
It is too early!

25
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,483
It is too early for you also Sanji-kun!

26
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,216
How you will want!

27
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,483
Cutie Wagon is digging
an increasingly consequent variation.

28
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,283
Allons-y, Monda!

29
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:39,750
Hey.

30
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:42,150
What doesn't go?

31
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:42,950
Cleaned!

32
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,416
They return.

33
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,283
Cutie Wagon goes in the bad direction!

34
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,616
But why thus?

35
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,283
Why?!

36
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,816
I was on!

37
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,883
I knew that this current was suspect.

38
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:59,283
Let us increase speed!

39
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,083
Follow us!

40
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,550
IEA aïïe, Sir!

41
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,883
Test once again, Monda!

42
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,216
The team of the straw hat increased her pace!

43
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,016
From now on, the participants move
together towards the long corals.

44
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:22,616
Barrel Tiger and My-iikida
can return more behind!

45
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,083
It is what that?

46
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,416
Finally, here it is!

47
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,750
The démoniaque intervention of Foxy!

48
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,950
Can one escape that?

49
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,750
What does he want this dumb?

50
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,683
Impossible to see what occurs in front.

51
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:50,550
They is too dangerous for the team of the hat
of straw to advance, even inch.

52
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:56,283
Operation “Cloud of successful White Snow”!

53
00:04:56,816 --> 00:05:00,016
Let us see seeing, how you will cross
this coral labyrinth while being blind!

54
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,416
Succeeded, hein?

55
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,350
Wait!!

56
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,816
They are escaped!

57
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:11,016
They left the cloud with facility!

58
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,550
I would have suspected it…

59
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:18,283
The crew of the straw hat sails
quietly among the corals!

60
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,283
While waiting, Cutie Wagon is…

61
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,616
… still being made push back!

62
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,216
The boat moves all alone forwards.

63
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,416
What occurs?

64
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:29,216
There is a labyrinth of currents.

65
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,416
Labyrinth of currents?

66
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,350
Ouais.

67
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,350
Because of the swirl which is in front.

68
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,416
There is a series of small swirls in the barrier.

69
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,150
It was not the sorrow to be concerned with visibility.

70
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:45,216
Once the entry passed, the current
we will take along out of the barrier.

71
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,616
Brilliant!

72
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:50,550
Did you see that?!
The talent of our navigatrice!

73
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,283
As always, you are incredible!

74
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:55,350
Nami-swan!

75
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:57,683
Shit!

76
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,150
But their joy is of short duration.

77
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:05,616
Once they will have passed the forest of
corals, they will be on the “Long Boxing ring”!

78
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,416
This swirl will carry out us right in hell!

79
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:11,416
Ussop!

80
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,883
Stop howling and uses your gadget!

81
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,816
Which gadget?

82
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:15,083
Impact!

83
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,883
Hein? This trick there?

84
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,616
Impossible, nan. nan. nan. nan.

85
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,150
Go! Use it!
Impossible, nan. nan. nan. nan.

86
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:21,616
Hey.

87
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:22,883
When you have…

88
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,150
Hurry!

89
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,083
If you dispatches not, us
will be swallowed by the swirl.

90
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,683
Since when you carried that with you?

91
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:32,150
I did it front, but when I use it, my shoulder…

92
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,216
I do not worry of what will arrive at your shoulder.

93
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,083
It IS OF MY SHOULDER about WHICH YOU SPEAK!!!

94
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,416
Go ahead Ussop!

95
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,350
We do not have any more time!

96
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,950
Zut! Just when I thought that them
things were going to be calmed for good.

97
00:06:44,216 --> 00:06:46,683
It was a bad idea of
to take part in this competition.

98
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,350
I feel terrified only by looking at that…

99
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,350
All is regulated, Long Conk…

100
00:06:58,483 --> 00:06:59,550
I would be never…

101
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,616
Look at to me that, Barrel Tiger!

102
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:06,483
They passed over
swirl in company of My-iikida.

103
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,150
It is perhaps better to fly than to sail.

104
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:12,816
They also pass the Long one Wraps.

105
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,150
Will they land on water now? Not…

106
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:27,683
Ca broke…

107
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:37,016
My-iikada landed on Length
Wrap and received large damage.

108
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,816
From now on, they cannot
to continue the race, impossible!

109
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,083
My-iikada is disqualified!

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,666
I am afflicted, Nami-san!

111
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,600
Do not make any you for us and sinks right in front!

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,133
Ok, does not worry you!

113
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,400
Barrel Tiger is at the head with a broad advance.

114
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,666
Invincible Cutie Wagon T he will know the defeat?

115
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,866
I think that you took to us a little too with the light one.

116
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,133
Porch-chan, hold of all your forces.

117
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:04,600
I count on you!

118
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,200
Combination.

119
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,066
“Driving Poisson Double”

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,066
Wait, they did not lose yet!

121
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,466
They created a combining engine
a man-fish and a shark!

122
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:21,400
They leave in hunting, while passing through the corals!

123
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:28,466
From now on, the race in is already with its half.
Barrel Tiger, which fights, is always at the head of race!

124
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,866
Ussop, rises!

125
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,000
Impossible!

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Hurry and rows!

127
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,933
The boat moves towards a strange direction.

128
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:40,800
Direction of the race!

129
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:41,800
On the right…

130
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,066
It is that, turn right!

131
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,133
You really believe that one was going to fall in it?!

132
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,800
It was destroyed!

133
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:52,466
The false control panel
of Oyabi did not function!

134
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,800
Doesn't this girl thus believe of anything the whole?

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
The farm up there!!

136
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,066
It is also coarse!

137
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,666
The race continues!

138
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,266
And Barrel Tiger goes
to confront with the next obstacles!

139
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,933
It is what these water pillars?

140
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:16,000
While being high towards the skies, they
pass through long the jets d'eau.

141
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,333
Is this really a natural phenomenon?

142
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:18,866
Grandmother.

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Oyabi!

144
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,600
Nan… Grandmother.

145
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,800
I drop… I am useless.

146
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:28,200
I never knew but Mikabi Ozon
was the small son of Oyabi.

147
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,533
Eh you, on the boat.

148
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,533
Can you stop and come to help me?

149
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,133
What all does that mean?

150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,666
They completely ignored the old patient and a child!
Either they do not have any sympathy or they are egoistic!

151
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,866
Nami, the navigatrice in the middle of ice!

152
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,066
Hey you, I said to you to close it!

153
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,066
Who would be enough stupid to be made trap by that?!

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,933
It is also coarse!

155
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,866
Here is the arrival!

156
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,266
How one small moment before the victory!

157
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:00,333
Allons-y!

158
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,066
Cutie Wagon is catching up with the leader.
It is the first stage, Donut Race!

159
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,066
Who will be…

160
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,733
The winner?!

161
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:17,866
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

162
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:25,333
MUGIWARA-TEAM

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,333
Who will be…

164
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,133
The winner?!

165
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,133
I said to you…

166
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,533
To buckle it!

167
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,266
She saw trickery!

168
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,333
The false finishing line did not function!

169
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:41,600
It is too strong!

170
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:46,800
Do you know what is a “pure heart”?

171
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,000
I of insane!

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Not well! My words do not affect it!

173
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,133
The true finishing line is probably close.

174
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,466
I cannot use impact any more!

175
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,733
I know!

176
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,933
And at the same time, a tragedy occurs!

177
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:02,933
The team of Porch-chan is
stopped with the false finishing line!

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,666
Did one gain?

179
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,800
Hey! Where did they go?

180
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,600
Its innocence is so touching!

181
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,933
But go counts of your error, Porch-chan!

182
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,933
It is right a delay!

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,666
If one loses against these gugusses,

184
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,333
I would have shame all my life!

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,000
And over all, they want
to take one of our companions!

186
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,466
Oh not! It is not the true finishing line.

187
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,466
What?! Who would make a similar thing

188
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:31,000
In this moment, Barrel Tiger is in front of,
and skirts the long coast of bamboo!

189
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:34,533
It is the last stage before the arrival!

190
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
It is true, I can see the arrival!

191
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,000
Wait!

192
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,533
Hey, they start to catch up with us!

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,333
One cannot compete in term speed.

194
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,333
It is that Ussop! You can cut down
some of these feet of bamboo?

195
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Bamboo?!

196
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,533
Yosh!

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Like that?

198
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,467
Still, still!

199
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
More quickly, Kabouti!

200
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,600
I undertake to run them!

201
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:58,867
Ok!

202
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,933
How that, like that, that, that?!

203
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,533
Wow! Bingo!

204
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,200
Oh not! Kabouti!

205
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,133
These unpleasant…

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,533
they will not be left there like that!

207
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,400
It is what? Magic flowers?

208
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,000
Ah, it is of Shuriken…

209
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:28,933
Oh shit!

210
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,933
They is not good, there is a hole in the hull of the boat!

211
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,800
Ca will go, it will hold good.

212
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:36,933
The arrival is right in front of our eyes.

213
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:41,800
The first round of Da Back Fight the “Donut Race”,

214
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,800
is about to finish!

215
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,267
Cleaned, hold good!

216
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,933
I really do not want to lose against them!

217
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,067
Dispatch you to catch up with them!

218
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,867
If that continues like that, one will lose!

219
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:57,600
Allons-y, Oyabin.

220
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,333
Who will gain?

221
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,467
Oh, just in time…

222
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,933
Brilliant, the group of Nami is at the head!

223
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
Nami-san!!

224
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,267
Robin-chwan!!

225
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,367
I like when you sink!

226
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,067
Damage for you the guy.
I like when you sink!

227
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,400
Why? One will gain!

228
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,467
For the moment, but look at.

229
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,333
Oyabi is there.

230
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,933
And then? It can nothing make from now on.

231
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:29,467
You know, Oyabi has the capacity
of a fruit of the demon, like you.

232
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,417
Cutie Wagon is victorious!

233
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:52,883
The winner of the first round of
Da back Fight is our idol, Porch-chan!

234
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,750
It is what you deserve, idiotic!

235
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,017
Iyan, thank you with all!

236
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,950
Porch-chan, you are the best!

237
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:00,617
It is an obvious result.

238
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,883
We will take a member
of your crew now!

239
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:07,817
Nobody can overcome the crew of Foxy Pirates!

240
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,617
It is time for you to say goodbye…

241
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,950
with the one of your companions!

242
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,950
Will Ca go? You are not wounded?

243
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,883
Not… we are well.

244
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:28,817
Did Hey, what occur?

245
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,550
And Ben, I…

246
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,817
It is what I would like to know!
Why we lost?!

247
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,083
Ben, I thought that you had gained, but you
be all become slow and you were exceeded.

248
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,750
There is nothing odd in it!

249
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,883
The reason of your slowness is my Noro Mako!

250
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:49,017
Hey, bloody little fool! What you made them?!

251
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:51,017
“Noro Mako”?

252
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:54,283
It is a particle which does not have yet
summer scientifically recorded.

253
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,483
All that bathes in this light, that it
that is to say a form of life, a liquid or a gas,

254
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:05,083
Will not lose energy but will lose its physical swiftness!

255
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:07,617
I included/understood anything, you must be idiotic.

256
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,083
Devastation…

257
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,550
Iyan, Oyabin!

258
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,550
But… that seems…

259
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,617
“Impossible”? It is what you want to say?

260
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,283
You should know that on this sea,
this kind of words does not have a direction.

261
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,817
All that it key becomes slow.

262
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,417
It is that “Noro Mako”!

263
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:28,017
Ah, if you say it like that, I include/understand.

264
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,683
I became a Man-Noro.
My body is able to emit these rays.

265
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,217
Look at… my capacity!
[Noro:Slow]

266
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,817
The ball of gun is…

267
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:46,817
The effect of Noro Noro lasts during 30 seconds.

268
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:50,817
After that, the ball of gun will find
its speed, as so of nothing was not.

269
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,550
You your eyes of them, isn't this does not believe?

270
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,417
It is…

271
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:58,950
Oyabi!

272
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,417
Shit. Ca wants to say that one was made have.

273
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,617
Ca explains their confidence compared to the play…

274
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,417
To have our delayed capacities…

275
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,083
At all events, you that, isn't this likes to do?

276
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,817
You, bad losers!

277
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:15,017
The winner of the first round, Donut Race…

278
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,683
… it is US.

279
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,283
Was Iyan, it tight hein?

280
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:27,817
The first round is finished, and now it is
the hour to take a member of the opposing crew!

281
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,817
Then to begin the first that I want it is…

282
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:41,883
YOU!

283
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,150
The doctor, Tony Tony Chopper!

284
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,483
Hein… Me?!

285
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,083
Exactly. Bring it.

286
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,883
Not… Chopper!

287
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:54,283
It is an incredibly unusual animal!

288
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,950
And it is even softer than I imagined it!

289
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,617
Iyan, Oyabi, leave me the touch too!

290
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,283
SUPER NICE!

291
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,150
We will take this one!

292
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,017
Chopper!

293
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,817
Which dumb, therefore was its objective Chopper?

294
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:15,217
It is true that it is a rare pearl from rare.

295
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,950
It is a maniac of the nice things.

296
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,750
Or a maniac of the furs.

297
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:23,150
Cease your stupid things! It is not a joke,
they took one of our companions!

298
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,283
My friends…

299
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,350
Oï, Oï, Dr. Chopper.

300
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:31,283
You are one of the members of my crew now.

301
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,950
You will have to obey me. First of all, mets this mask.

302
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,883
My companions…

303
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,550
Forgive me, Chopper!

304
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,417
It is because one lost…

305
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,350
Shit!

306
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,683
It is really unusual!

307
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,750
It is amazing, a reindeer which speaks…

308
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,083
Be content for you hein?

309
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,550
Enchanted, partner.

310
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:01,817
My friends!

311
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,883
I only came because you want me!

312
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:08,417
I do not want that!

313
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:12,217
I do not want to do that, Luffy!

314
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,683
I only came at sea
because you asked it to me!

315
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:18,617
Together with these guy…

316
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:25,150
It is not where I want to be! I am a member of the crew of the straw hat, Tony Tony Chopper!

317
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:28,950
I do not want!

318
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:32,950
Stop pleurnicher, Chopper!

319
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:34,883
They is ashamed!

320
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,617
Zoro…

321
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,083
To come at sea was MT decision. MT responsibility.

322
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,483
It does not matter how that occurs, it is your responsibility.

323
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:43,617
Does not blame us.

324
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,083
We accepted this play.

325
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:49,417
Ussop, has you, everyone
fought of all its forces.

326
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,017
In this universe of piracy, anybody
any sympathy will not show.

327
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,483
If are to you a man…

328
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,150
Sit down, buckles it and looks at it
remain of these whores of tests.

329
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:02,217
How can you say that?

330
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:04,483
You know what it feels?!

331
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,150
Of agreement, made as you want!

332
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:14,417
Chopper!

333
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,017
Yosh.

334
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:18,750
This epeist is cool!

335
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:21,283
Yosha! Zoro, will show them!

336
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,950
Bring back for us Chopper!

337
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,750
Oyabi, let us take this epeist the next time.

338
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:26,417
The reindeer has also tripe!

339
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,417
Let us begin the second round.

340
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,750
Tears… I am crying!

341
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,083
It is true. There remain still two rounds.

342
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:38,417
It is necessary that one recovers our small ration of
survival, before it is done too many concern.

343
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,350
Sanji, one counts on you!

344
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:44,883
The deal was made. Serious things
make that to start in this Da Back Fight!

345
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:49,350
Wait one minute… Chopper is supposed to be
in the second round. But they took it.

346
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:50,350
Exact.

347
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,883
It is the best moment of the play!

348
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,150
I will say it to you…

349
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,417
in agreement with the rules, you
donot can change the participants.

350
00:19:57,683 --> 00:20:02,350
In the second round, Groggy Boxing ring, the crew of
straw hat has only two participants!

351
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,150
Therefore, an easy victory for Foxy Pirates!

352
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,017
What?!

353
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,550
Be free for you to stop, wet hen.

354
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,083
Not question. I could say to you
the same thing, face of fart.

355
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,217
Difficult to think that these deux-là
can work in team…

356
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,017
You want to fight?!

357
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:16,950
Stop that!
You want to fight?!

358
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,083
Now, I will explain the rules of Groggy Ring!

359
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,083
There are two goals on each side of the ground.

360
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,150
It is necessary to put the ball in
goal to gain. However…

361
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:27,950
the ball is not made of rubber.

362
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,483
Ca will be human!

363
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:32,883
Each team will have, in other words,
somebody who will be the ball!

364
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:35,617
Hey, you two. Who would like to be the ball?

365
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,550
By here the ball.

366
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,550
It is not with you to decide!

367
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:42,217
YOU ES the ball, head of alga!

368
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,617
Oh, they arrive! It is their entry…

369
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,550
Champions of Groggy Boxing ring!

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,750
They are still unconquered!

371
00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:57,017
Butt them!

372
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,483
They are Groggy Monsters!

373
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,883
And they enter now on the ground!

374
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,883
First of all, we have “Full Dash” alias Hamburger!

375
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:12,150
Behind him, we have “Tackle Demon” Pickles!

376
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,483
And behind, the being is found
semi-giant semi-man-fish…

377
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,817
“Big Bang” Botan!

378
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,883
They are really the monsters of the boxing ring!

379
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,950
Go! Go! Go!

380
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,750
What is it that?

381
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,017
But it is what this enormous man-fish?!

382
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:37,083
And it is him which with the ball!

383
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,017
You are not likely any to gain!

384
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,617
Unexpected?

385
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,350
At all.

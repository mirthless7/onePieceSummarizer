1
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:36,710
Those which fly through the vast sky!

2
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:36,710
The 1000 year old alarm clock of legend!

3
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,970
It arrives!

4
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,810
Fire! Fire!!

5
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,070
Ryuji!!!

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,580
Ryuji, hold good!

7
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,670
Ryuji!!!!!!!

8
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,900
Cling!

9
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,940
You must turn over to the nest of the dragons!

10
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,440
Fight!

11
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,150
Ryuji…

12
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,030
Ryuji is…

13
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,570
Wretched bastard!

14
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,700
They is not good…

15
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,990
Ouais, it can swim more.

16
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,590
Which fun.

17
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,390
To so abruptly charge me like that.

18
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,510
Admiral!

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,600
Sennenryu is running!

20
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,100
No panic.
It will be captured before it runs.

21
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,440
Use the harpoon to bring back it to edge!

22
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,080
Target Sennenryu!

23
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,210
Perfect. Draw when it is ready!

24
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,420
Yes!

25
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,420
Yes!

26
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,970
What?

27
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,020
What you made?

28
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,610
You do not have any idea on what you are, small snotty-nosed kid.

29
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,120
The only thing that I want they are the bones of Sennenryu.

30
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,120
When I would have this Ryukotsu,

31
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,370
I would obtain the eternal life!

32
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,670
Salt bastard!!!!!!!

33
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,360
Ryuji is not a thing!

34
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,070
It is our friend!

35
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,070
We sailed together!

36
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,780
It is a expensive friend in our eyes!

37
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,870
It is what this connery?

38
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,330
If it is the case, why you do not run with your friend?

39
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,580
How oses you to attack me?

40
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,960
Kill this little runt!

41
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,460
But, if one does that Sennenryu…

42
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,420
And then?

43
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,130
Even if its bones are reduced in parts,
I will be able to always collect them!

44
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,050
Yes!

45
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,680
Target the surface of the ocean!

46
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,050
Yes!

47
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,350
Is that enough?

48
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,900
Would not be if defaitist!

49
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
Our goal yet was not achieved!

50
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,530
One will go to the nest of the dragons!

51
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,360
Stop saying that you cannot about it any more!

52
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,370
You know that I am right!

53
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,830
You do not have to worry for Apis!

54
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,580
Now, you must think of you.

55
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,380
Detach me!

56
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,220
I must be with Ryuji!

57
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,010
It is what that?

58
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,220
I must save Ryuji!

59
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,810
Let Luffy deal with Ryuji!

60
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,140
Not, not, not!

61
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,270
I want to go there! I want to go there! I want to go there!

62
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,980
It will save it! You will see!

63
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,150
The ocean starts to tremble!

64
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,570
What is it?

65
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,240
What does it occur?

66
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,670
What?

67
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,750
What does it occur?

68
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,260
Ryuji…

69
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,060
Really?

70
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,430
You want to say?

71
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,770
What still?

72
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,610
One does not know! There is no underwater volcano known in this zone!

73
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,070
One of fout!

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,660
Fire! Fire! Fire!

75
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,850
I included/understood!

76
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,150
You have also important friends at your sides!

77
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,440
Ryuji!

78
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,570
Why he howls thus?

79
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,200
He calls them…

80
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,570
Who that?

81
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,710
Sennenryu disseminated throughout the world.

82
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,210
Time came!

83
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,420
It is what he says.

84
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,290
Did time come?

85
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,750
Does that want to say what?

86
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,800
Is He, He, it what over there?

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,740
SEN… Sennenryu,
the sky is filled by it!

88
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,540
I bet that they are the friends of Ryuji!

89
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,290
Ouais!

90
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,500
Incredible!

91
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,210
But from where they leave?

92
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,530
It is…

93
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,000
of Ryukotsu!

94
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,260
A whole mountain of Ryukotsu for me all alone!

95
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,390
Made fire!

96
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,770
Cut down them!

97
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,810
Impossible!

98
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,190
The guns cannot draw so high!

99
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,280
Ryuji!

100
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,200
Yes, I included/understood.

101
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,410
I will say it to Apis of your share.

102
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,820
Let use your neck to me!

103
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,770
What? What did it make?

104
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,030
What occurred?

105
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,370
It killed the Admiral!!!!

106
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,880
These guy of the Navy quickly give up once their chief with ground.

107
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,220
And these drafts did not even take care on him.

108
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,890
Let us drop us too.

109
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,560
They turn in round?

110
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,980
Why?

111
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,480
He, hurries!

112
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,650
Ouais!

113
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,610
Ahh, chains!

114
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,330
Stop cretin!

115
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,780
One will return oneself inside!

116
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,500
Wahou! They was cool!

117
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,210
Nami-San! I am of return!

118
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,880
Keep silent yourself and goes up!

119
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,710
Where is Luffy?

120
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,300
That it is owl!

121
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,310
Yo!

122
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,600
Y' does not have a yo which holds!!

123
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,560
A little softer when you would be landed!

124
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,690
You will break the boat!!

125
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,860
Ryuji!

126
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,400
An earthquake?

127
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,360
Still?

128
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,740
Ryuji…

129
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,370
My promise with Ryuji…

130
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,080
I will not be able to hold it.

131
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,420
I will not be able to bring it to the nest of the dragons.

132
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,210
The wish of Ryuji was carried out.

133
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,720
Sennenryu call…
You can hear them?

134
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,820
Hein? It is what?

135
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,570
There are as many earthquakes why?

136
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,450
This one is strongest!

137
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,700
He, looks at!

138
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,580
The ocean is withdrawn!

139
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,980
Then it is that!

140
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,190
What do you want to say, Nami-San?

141
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,980
How said it the fresco, the nest of the dragons is here!

142
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,150
The name “Sennenryu” does not refer to their lifetime.

143
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,490
That means that they come on this island once every 1000 years!

144
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,880
Sennenryu are migrating!

145
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,840
The herd did not appear here by chance!

146
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,630
“Lost Island” is the perfect name for that.

147
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,590
It makes surface only once every 1000 years.

148
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,430
It is normal that nobody remembers this emergence!

149
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,730
And now, in this moment,

150
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,900
the nest of the dragons will appear!

151
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,140
Incredible!

152
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,960
It could be that it is…

153
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,920
Yes.

154
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,550
It is the nest of the dragons which Ryuji wanted to re-examine.

155
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,760
Then it is…

156
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,400
He! He, Apis!

157
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,610
Apis!

158
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,030
But where it like that runs?

159
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,940
It is Ryuji.

160
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,530
Ryuji is over there.

161
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,030
Ryuji!

162
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,580
Ryuji!!

163
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,460
Ryuji!!

164
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,250
Ryuji!!

165
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,470
It is by sheer coincidence,

166
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,770
but the place where Ryuji fell is the nest of the dragons.

167
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,390
I wonder whether it knows that it can rest in peace.

168
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,850
Worry you!

169
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,730
Before running, he said that its wish was carried out.

170
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,990
Then it is that the nest of the dragons.

171
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,240
There are many rocks bizarroïdes.

172
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,860
I wonder

173
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,120
if it is of Ryukotsu.

174
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,660
Look at this rock over there.

175
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,500
One would say a dragon, you do not believe?

176
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,210
He well yes…

177
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,250
Why these rocks are carved like dragons?

178
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,750
Because during these 1000 years,
they were under the ocean.

179
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,460
Their bodies were calcified.

180
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,670
I see.

181
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,720
You included/understood a word of what she said?

182
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,680
Not, nothing the whole!

183
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,350
When the elephants die,

184
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,810
they go in a place called “cemetery of the elephants”, you see?

185
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,980
It is perhaps what is this place,

186
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,480
a cemetery of dragons.

187
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,150
A cemetery of dragons…

188
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,730
Not! It is not true!

189
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,280
Ryuji said to me that if it turned over to the nest of the dragons, it would be much better!

190
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,870
That cannot be a cemetery!!

191
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,620
Apis…

192
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,000
Ryuji was stray Sennenryu.

193
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,500
Luffy?

194
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,540
During 1000 years, it was all alone.

195
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,880
But, then it became friendly with Apis.

196
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,180
Apart from the 1000 years that he lived,

197
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,520
it was the time spent with you that he cherished more in the world.

198
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,770
Luffy.

199
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,070
You can include/understand what the dragons say?

200
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,230
About.

201
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,110
Do not tell conneries.

202
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,990
But, I know what he said!

203
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,070
Liar.

204
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,740
Ryuji, liar…

205
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,790
It is a nest of dragons.

206
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,790
The nest of the dragons was found,
then opens the eyes!

207
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,460
Speak to me!

208
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,130
You will be better!

209
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,470
Ryuji did not lie.

210
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,900
He said that Sennenryu was to turn over to the nest of the dragons every 1000 years

211
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,190
to reappear.

212
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,190
Ryuji would be…

213
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,610
Look at over there!

214
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,710
A Sennenryu baby!

215
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,350
Then you see, Apis…

216
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,280
This place is not only one cemetery of dragons.

217
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,700
It is also… a place which connects them to a new life.

218
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,870
Thank you, everyone.

219
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,740
When Ryuji said
“Bring back for me to the nest dragons”,

220
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,450
I believe that I included/understood

221
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,750
the kind of place that was to be,

222
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,710
and why Ryuji wanted to return there at all costs.

223
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,420
Apis…

224
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,630
It is an incredible place.

225
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,260
I include/understand why our ancestors built these temples now.

226
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,350
Thank you, Luffy.

227
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,310
Now, let us turn over to the village!

228
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,320
I bet that the villagers must worry!

229
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,820
Ouais!

230
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,490
Very well!

231
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,240
Let us turn over on the boat and leave this island!

232
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
He! I have the flagstone!

233
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,250
Sanji, prepares to us something of good!

234
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,790
Very well.

235
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,040
With meat!

236
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,590
Me of vegetables and a large dish of beans!

237
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,250
As if I had ever heard that front.

238
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,680
But this place is incredible!

239
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,930
Then they all are of Sennenryu?

240
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,360
Yes one would say well.

241
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,700
Too much hard for Ryukotsu.

242
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,230
If they become all like that,
that must be right a fairy tale.

243
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,730
Then the elixir of youth, you believe…

244
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,730
A dream among so much of others.

245
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,440
With all this coral which recovers them,

246
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,400
it is impossible to make an elixir.

247
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,780
I suppose that you are right.

248
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,120
These guy of the Navy wasted just their time.

249
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,040
Bandage cretins!

250
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,380
I do not die so easily!

251
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,050
I must really thank you.

252
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,550
But, not yet.

253
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,560
Of Sennenryu!

254
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,100
With them I will be able to have as much of Ryukotsu than I want!

255
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,940
Release.

256
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,650
Erik, looks at!

257
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,030
A whole herd of Sennenryu!

258
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,780
I will pay you more!
Let us make another market!

259
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,740
With alive Sennenryu,

260
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,160
we can extract the elixir!

261
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,790
Out of my way!!!!

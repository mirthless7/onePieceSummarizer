1
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,690
Where am I?

2
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,459
You should not move!

3
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,030
Chief, the Belfry of Gold!

4
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,249
Our duty is
to always protect it.

5
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,620
Abrupt step, Wiper.

6
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,800
Vearth does not reject anybody.

7
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,219
Yes.

8
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,770
For people gathered here, the war
is the most unthinkable thing which is.

9
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,390
It is the festival!

10
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,900
400 long years of war
on Skypiea are finished,

11
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,260
the festival étreignant the country
continued throughout the night.

12
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:47,390
I came here! 
weaving of Poneglyphes

13
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,949
Not… Not…

14
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,010
I can more nothing drink…

15
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,650
Found!

16
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,750
He!

17
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,009
What?

18
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,160
Nami, awakes the guy!

19
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,870
Why?

20
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,540
One will prick a little gold
and to leave on vacation with!

21
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,929
You found ace of gold?

22
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,769
Imbecile!

23
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,559
You speak too extremely!

24
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,059
And then?!

25
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,189
You shout twice more extremely than me!

26
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,479
He! You ace shouted more extremely when you ace
known as how it was me which shouted!

27
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,530
Ca it is what then?! You shouted ace even more extremely when you ace says that I said that you shouted more extremely!

28
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,659
You shout MUCH,
MUCH more extremely than me!

29
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,119
You make fun of me!

30
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,980
It is you which shout!

31
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,289
The farm!

32
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,320
How somebody can it sleep here?!

33
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,999
Usopp struck me!

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,569
Would He, why I have done that?

35
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,039
Do not try to show me!

36
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,999
But you struck me
with your arm! BAM!

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
BAM, straightforwardly on my belly!

38
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,549
Inhabitants of the Blue Sea
really like to have fun the festival.

39
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,809
It is as if they were
tired at all.

40
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,130
They are not human.

41
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,609
Then, it is that the plan!

42
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,319
Ouais, the guy.

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,839
It was our only chance
to visit the celestial island!

44
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,560
Let us not leave any regret behind us!

45
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,020
It is so cool!

46
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,400
I tremble about it of excitation!

47
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,830
Chief! We have
found the Gold Bell!

48
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,490
What?!

49
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,469
He, be sure for you?!

50
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,379
Yes, it was wedged
on Giant Jack!

51
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,050
Everyone tests
to tear off now!

52
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,099
That all warriors into good
health go on the west coast!

53
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,349
Quickly! As quickly as possible!

54
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,109
Ok, bring as much of
people that you can!

55
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,640
Let us go quickly on the west coast!

56
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,569
We found the Belfry!

57
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,519
Where is it?

58
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,819
On the west coast.

59
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,859
Ok!

60
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,569
Be sure for you?

61
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,319
Ouais!

62
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,800
Grouillez you!

63
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,819
The Bell fell into
sea, but it is always there!

64
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,739
Ouais!

65
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,570
That all those which can move
we join on the west coast!

66
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,289
We found the Belfry!

67
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,360
Go on the west coast!

68
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,570
The Belfry?

69
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,419
Still!

70
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,330
Loan, and…

71
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,170
Draw!

72
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,270
Shit, one does not have enough men!

73
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,199
It is the pride of Shandora,
our ancestral city!

74
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,130
We must recover it!

75
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,349
Yes!

76
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,329
Be ready to draw!

77
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,570
Loan, and…

78
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,970
Draw more extremely!

79
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,239
A rubber band?

80
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,569
You call that a rubber band?

81
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,700
Exact. And 90% of the power which cut down it
Giant Jack was provided by Usopp Wagomu!

82
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,700
[Note:Wagomu = elastic]

83
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,659
Mashed potatoes!

84
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,190
I am only in all
blue Sea to have some!

85
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,730
Incredible!

86
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,089
But wait, there is another thing
who could interest you…

87
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,490
A metal plate!

88
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,259
Is Ok, which my offer?

89
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,879
It is not a plate
of ordinary metal!

90
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,169
Abused through crushing
tests of Large Line…

91
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,339
and the pitiless attack of Eneru,
the Merry Vogue is always intact!

92
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,229
Our mast is always upright thanks to
metal plates like this one!

93
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,430
Then? You want metal?

94
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,599
I sell that one to you
for some Dials!

95
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,319
Not, I will take the rubber band!
I exchange it to you against Dial!

96
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,899
I want some too!
You still have some?

97
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,779
Me too!

98
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,529
Me too!

99
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,279
Is this reality?

100
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,140
For me too!

101
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,739
Water.

102
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,069
The light.

103
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,350
Fire.

104
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,780
The elements which destroy.

105
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,080
Even things without
substance can be…

106
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,120
crossed!

107
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,689
Too much chance! Too much chance!

108
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,519
You seem content with you, Usopp.

109
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,939
I am so lucky!

110
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,670
Did the market occur well?

111
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,989
He, looks at that!

112
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,510
Look at all Dials which I have!

113
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,510
Look at that one!

114
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,060
Like you?

115
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,779
Content for you.

116
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,199
It is brilliant you want to say!

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,140
I can make full with
things with these shells!

118
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,530
The workshop of Usopp will be revolutionized!

119
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,169
Say what of it to you?

120
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,289
I would make of tone katana
an aromatized sword…

121
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,089
and you will be submerged by the odor
melons during your drive!

122
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,280
They is good.

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,210
It is true! I can make
improvements on Clima Tact of Nami!

124
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,470
And my pachinko balls will make fear!

125
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,269
Besides, where passed
teams of Luffy and Robin?

126
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,149
The team of Luffy is still there.

127
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,270
Robin started from his side.

128
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,150
He Ben, this snake sleeps since
one good moment now.

129
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,539
He danced all during the night.

130
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,199
I do not know what made it so happy.

131
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,249
But more important still, if they
do not leave from here quickly,

132
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,499
it will awake and the things
will turn to the vinegar quickly.

133
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,499
Hein?

134
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,660
This so sympathetic snake?

135
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,459
Imbecile. You did not see this
thing when it becomes insane!

136
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,219
This so sympathetic snake?

137
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,540
I said just that you say that parce
that you did not see it in anger!

138
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,429
This so sympathetic snake?

139
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,470
He, you me listenings, Usopp?

140
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,429
This so sympathetic snake?

141
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,439
It was the Audio-Dial!

142
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,540
DECREE WITH THIS WEAK SHIT!

143
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,310
Weak! Weak! It
that called weak!

144
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,899
What, brothel?

145
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,739
What it ate
this snake?

146
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,199
You ace finally found, Luffy?

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,390
Look at! It is there!

148
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,739
Whaaaaaa!

149
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,739
Ca, it is a business!

150
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,079
It is so beautiful!

151
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,240
How that of the monkeys!

152
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,039
Ouais! Ouais! Ouais!

153
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
Look at all that!

154
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,929
Too much cool, hein?

155
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,920
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

156
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,310
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

157
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,060
It is gold?

158
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,829
Which marvellous vision.

159
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,990
You can feel his pride
only by looking at it.

160
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,589
It is a shame which one
columns is broken.

161
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,620
Ouais, but nothing there can.

162
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,089
He, wait.

163
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,410
Look at over there!

164
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,960
It is Ponéglyphe!

165
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,830
Stone that our ancestors have
protected with the danger from their lives!

166
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,400
But what that said, Chief?

167
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,050
Something which it is to better be unaware of.

168
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,409
We only have…

169
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,190
“Keep the truth in your
hearts, the closed mouth. “

170
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,579
“We are those who
will weave the history, “

171
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,860
“With the sound of the Large Belfry.”

172
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,329
How do you know these words?

173
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,339
They were registered in
ruins of Shandora.

174
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,210
You were charged to keep that
during generations, exact?

175
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,430
You want to say that you
can read this inscription?!

176
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,720
Having the name of a god,
the antique arms, Poséidon.

177
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,840
It gives its site.

178
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,299
How that?

179
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,979
She said ancient!

180
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,779
An ancient weapon?

181
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,149
Why would she say that?

182
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,010
Ouais, why?

183
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,350
Another weapon.

184
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,400
Different from Pluto of Alabasta.

185
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,220
Pluto. Of only one gust, it can destroy
a whole island without leaving the least trace.

186
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,340
To say that a thing also méprisable
tapit still in this world…

187
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,370
As I thought it,
still another dead end.

188
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,960
It is not what I want to know.

189
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,049
He there!

190
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,300
This trick registers with dimensions in
does it also form part?

191
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,460
What?

192
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,019
Gol…

193
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,349
D…

194
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,840
Roger.

195
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,760
What?

196
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,779
“I came here…”

197
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,949
“and I will carry out it
passage au boils of the world. “

198
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,980
“Gold D.Roger the Pirate”

199
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,440
The Lord of the Pirates!

200
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,160
Ca wants to say that it is
come on the celestial island?!

201
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,740
But what means this inscription?

202
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,670
Not, more important still, how
did it know to use this writing?

203
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,920
It is the name of Roger?

204
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,660
You know it?

205
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:47,430
It is a pirate of the Blue Sea which
there came here is more than twenty years.

206
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,619
Its name
is registered over there?

207
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,710
Yes.

208
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,270
I cannot know how
it could reach this bell…

209
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,940
But this is the proof that it did it.

210
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,640
Now that I think of it…

211
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,060
There are two types of Ponéglyphes:

212
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,720
Those which contain information and
those which give the site of the others.

213
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,410
These is a stone which
contains information.

214
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,550
“I came here and I will carry out
this passage at the end of the world. “

215
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,210
To carry out the passage…

216
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,960
To carry out…

217
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,460
Would like he to speak about Rio Ponéglyphe?!

218
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,180
Chief.

219
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,410
This Ponéglyphe has fully
achieved its task.

220
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,270
Its task?

221
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,080
Yes, there is of Ponéglyphes which contains
information scattered in the world.

222
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,170
By reading them separately, they must form
a passage which fills the vacuum in the history.

223
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,280
In other words…

224
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,009
The joined together, complete text.

225
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,800
This still unknown text
is Rio Ponéglyphe.

226
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,510
The Lord of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger…

227
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,930
must have carried it
passage to destination.

228
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,579
Therefore, now…

229
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,330
You known as…

230
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,920
what our duty was accomplished?

231
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,310
Us…

232
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,520
We… will not have…

233
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,580
to beat us more?

234
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,079
I see.

235
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,870
The wish of our
ancestors was exaucé!

236
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,379
Chief!

237
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,839
Chief!

238
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,379
Hold good!

239
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,009
Thank you my god! Thank you my god!

240
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,380
He was exaucé!

241
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,080
Yes.

242
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,469
That wants to say…

243
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,300
that I must carry the passages
of Ponéglyphes which I read…

244
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,010
to the island with the end
of Large Line, Raftel.

245
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,529
Say to me, Miss…

246
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,410
This boy with the straw hat
makes me the same impression as Roger.

247
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,230
Is this my imagination?

248
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,989
Its name is Monkey D. Luffy.

249
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,829
I am also interested in him.

250
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,869
“D”? I see.

251
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,620
Ca is appropriate to him to have
a name of only one letter.

252
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,880
Yes, all that will certainly have
great historical consequences.

253
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,249
Forgive me, Miss.

254
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,109
I remember that you were
here to find gold.

255
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,599
Ca has more value than Vearth
on isn't the Blue Sea?

256
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,469
Yes.

257
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,459
Then why not take
the broken column of the belfry?

258
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,009
Of course, us
let us can give you the Bell.

259
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,749
It is an good idea!

260
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,810
After all, we must thank you you
and your crew for what you did!

261
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,689
Ouais, it rightly!

262
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,979
Do not be timid.

263
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,859
Are you sure?

264
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,989
The others will be certainly
happy to have it.

265
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,800
Yes!

266
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,699
Ok!

267
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,909
Let us carry that on the boat
inhabitants of the Blue Sea!

268
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,039
Each one on a side!

269
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,159
Ca will be hard to carry!

270
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,579
We will give it to
savers of our country!

271
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,660
Heu, it is enormous.

272
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,080
What makes Robin? It spends time of them.

273
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,620
Oh, I start to be hungry.

274
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,469
The guy, this place is deserted.

275
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,540
What occurs?

276
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,229
Where they passed
warriors and angels?

277
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,729
Not, so much better if there is nobody.

278
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,100
If they see what one has on
backs, they will have some after us!

279
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,220
After all, one flew this
however to make a station-wagon, not?

280
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,859
They will not be very content
when they realize some.

281
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,449
Nami and Conis have all
prepared for our departure.

282
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,699
Grouiller is needed.

283
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,199
And then, Sanji, you ace
not a trick to be eaten?

284
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,890
All is on the boat.

285
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,340
Go, you must have well
something. Give me in.

286
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,349
Which wound.

287
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,869
Why one would have
to await this woman?

288
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,829
I will embark on the boat.

289
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,209
Cretin, does not even think of it!

290
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,879
Cretin!

291
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,999
Cretin of Marimo!

292
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,490
Marimo Cretin!

293
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,070
He, look at! It is Robin!

294
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,480
Robin-chan!

295
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,599
He, Robin!

296
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,909
Quickly, quickly!

297
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,019
One slips by!

298
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,479
One flew full of gold!

299
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,059
Morons! Do not say that!

300
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,479
Look behind it!

301
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,640
They all return!

302
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,260
There is a whole army!

303
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,909
Oh shit! Oh shit!

304
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,899
One is in a large shit!

305
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,449
It is Q-what that?!

306
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,869
It is a giant gun!

307
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,409
It is a gun! I am sure!

308
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,490
Thus they all arrive at the same time.

309
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,789
Will run towards the boat!

310
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,660
One cannot remain longer!

311
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,799
There, looks at! One has
full bags to the brim!

312
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,370
One is rich!

313
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,279
They took all
their luggage with them!

314
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,160
Me known as step which they leave already!

315
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,829
He, wait!

316
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,089
Wait!

317
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,019
Look at, they have some after us!

318
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,880
Cassos!

319
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,430
Good, it belongs to me of
to stop in their race!

320
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,609
You stop there! Not
means that one waits!

321
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,980
He! You say to them, Usopp!

322
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,779
We put our lives in danger
to reach the celestial island…

323
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,359
Quite known as!

324
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,069
and to find the legendary Gold City!

325
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,069
Robin-chan, quickly!
They will capture you!

326
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,070
Never a proud pirate
would leave the empty handeds!

327
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,119
To capture?

328
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,209
About what they do speak?

329
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,289
One wants just to thank them!

330
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,420
Won't He, you take this gold?

331
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
I think that they do not want any!

332
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,530
What?!

333
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,090
Flee!

334
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,680
There are tons of money!

335
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,359
Then, Zoro? I am quite occupied!

336
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,610
Ouais, it was impressive!

337
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,500
Robin-chwan, quickly!

338
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,529
WAIT!

339
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,560
Ok, the guy!

340
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,279
Will run to the edge of the cloud!

341
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,110
OUAIS!

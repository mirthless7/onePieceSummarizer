1
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:08,552
Coach n° 7

2
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:17,182
T-Bone captain.

3
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,140
It is impossible that they are hidden in a so small coach…

4
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,740
Good evening!

5
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,535
They are there!

6
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:33,766
They are on the other side of the door!

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,173
Criminals and a third located intruder.

8
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:40,541
I hate the indirect combat.

9
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:43,429
Chokkaku Senkou

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,576
Bone Sowaru

11
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:52,554
Di… disappeared!

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:00,329
It is not true!

13
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:03,568
They took down us.

14
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:05,586
WHAT!?

15
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:08,270
Shit! Bastards!

16
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,807
You do not lose anything to wait!

17
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:13,955
Already too late?

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,434
On this Sirs,
take guard with the monstres marins and good voyage!

19
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:21,007
Good-bye!

20
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:23,921
Coach n° 4

21
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:34,053
Wanze!

22
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:36,578
Insane the, insane one, Wanze!

23
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:42,381
Sift! Wanze!

24
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:53,399
If you want to cross this coach,
you must overcome me initially!

25
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,202
You hope to stop us?

26
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:03,825
I will stop you! Sift!

27
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:10,776
If, by chance, it occurs something during
the mission of this convoy in Umi Resha, I am there!

28
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:16,973
If you want to release the criminals… Initially try to beat my Ramen Kenpo!

29
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,055
They took down the last two coaches?

30
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,678
What do you manufacture?

31
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:28,940
All my excuses.

32
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,662
Our best soldier, the T-Bone captain, is also in the detached coaches.

33
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:37,203
Then, which is the situation of this train?

34
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:41,858
Yes. Without counting the engine, it remains in all the 5 coaches.

35
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:45,530
But the soldiers of Coach 5 all were beaten.

36
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,055
There remains only Wanze in Coach 4…

37
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,514
And Nero in Coach 3.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,612
Also, Nico Robin in Coach 1, and people here present in Coach 2.

39
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,464
It would be said that the enemy is not stupid.

40
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:08,740
But the only problem in this situation, it is that Franky was released.

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,167
Our mission is to escort Franky and Nico Robin in Enies Lobby.

42
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:19,069
This put aside, that some of them burst

43
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,462
or that it arrives to us something,

44
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:24,085
That does not affect the mission.

45
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,970
Then, did you identify the enemy?

46
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,709
Yes. Initially there are the two prisoners.

47
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,528
One of them carries an odd mask.

48
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:40,380
There is also a fair man in costume (ndT:under heard costar-cravatte). Thus three people in all.

49
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:46,119
It is probably a companion of Straw hat like the Long Nose.

50
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,299
Their objective is of course to recover Nico Robin.

51
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,136
And Franky their ready strong hand.

52
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,382
Lucci, do I have to supervise Nico Robin?

53
00:03:58,677 --> 00:03:59,792
Pas la pains.

54
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:03,169
Concentrate on recaptures of Franky.

55
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:07,595
To recover Nico Robin…

56
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,972
For them…

57
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,890
It is completely impossible.

58
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:25,811
Sanji VS Ramen Kenpo !
Fights Chiefs!

59
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:36,828
Coach n° 4

60
00:06:41,286 --> 00:06:44,041
At all events, let me deal with him

61
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,172
You, you go to the following coach.

62
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:51,286
Do not forget that it is our plan to help Robin.

63
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,761
It is impossible.

64
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:02,533
You… I… do not rez… no one… it… share!

65
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,401
I mix and I wet the flour…

66
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:08,794
It will remake ramen?

67
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:12,401
Ramen Beam!

68
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:16,172
Needles!

69
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,270
Caution!

70
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,467
Stop that!

71
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,417
One passes by above!

72
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,106
Ok.

73
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:42,303
With… then Sanji-kun, good luck.

74
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,548
Sift!

75
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,778
They are flee so quickly!

76
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,762
But it is quite as useless!

77
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:55,385
Because in the following coach, there is Nero.

78
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:58,906
Even if it is new, it is an assassin of the justice of the CP9!

79
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:00,381
They died!

80
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,122
Nero adores to kill.

81
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,037
Sift!

82
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,427
Flanchet Shot

83
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:47,570
So at least one knew in which coach is Robin,
one could be easily introduced there while passing by the roof.

84
00:08:48,054 --> 00:08:51,304
What is this you cards with marmonner? Dépèche to climb, Geso King!

85
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,787
(ndT:Geso = Squid)

86
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,815
Who calls you squid?!

87
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,603
Squid?

88
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:01,268
Ca…

89
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,893
Hurry a little, octopus species!

90
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:05,940
Speedo-kun!

91
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,566
I have an idea.

92
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,440
Listen with your heart.

93
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,705
To flee without stop do not make advance the things.

94
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,427
Do not oblige me to repeat that I am in a hurry.

95
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:30,878
Then I go there!

96
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,713
Ramen Kenpou:Menkiri

97
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:36,925
((ramen kenpou skate cut noodle on fire))

98
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:41,379
Fire-Skate!

99
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,600
Ca hurts!

100
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:02,656
While dodging me, you gave me ten kicks.

101
00:10:03,074 --> 00:10:04,443
Twelve blows.

102
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,022
Do not say to me that you are super strong!

103
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,003
It is right you who is super bad.

104
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:16,784
Oi oi! “super bad” you say, even my father me forever known as that!

105
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:17,590
Stop!

106
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:21,135
It is insulting! I am Wanzeee!

107
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,165
In fact your strange rolled up eyebrows give me the tournis.

108
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,017
Put besides, you are rather gifted.

109
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:33,205
YOU ES BADLY PLACE TO SAY THAT MY HEAD STRANGE EAST.

110
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:38,305
Sah! They is good.

111
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:45,146
You will include/understand why I was choose for this mission of escort.

112
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,269
Ramen Kenpou Ougi

113
00:10:57,632 --> 00:10:59,730
((ramen kenpou technical ultimate))

114
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:04,662
To beat noodles! To beat noodles to finish…

115
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,335
What is it that?

116
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:11,318
An edible combination of combat of dream!

117
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,496
Men' S Formal Follows!!
(conventional noodle combination)

118
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:20,352
Its-its-saaa!

119
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,299
The advantage of Ramen Kenpo is to use noodles freely.

120
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:27,575
Dumb…

121
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,630
He plays with food since presently.

122
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:38,117
Special speed, power, blows… I am completely different from presently.
(ndT:repetition of “presently” - _-)

123
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,775
I will show you a force of another level!

124
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,533
Stop speaking and brings itself.

125
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:54,401
Jerk, I will make you eat all these noodles then are held ready.

126
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:19,580
And?

127
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,978
Be to you which you?

128
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,467
I keep the third coach.

129
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,657
Using 4 styles, novel member of the CP 9.

130
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:33,890
The weasel of the seas, Nero.

131
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,451
Shaow!

132
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,969
Then what…?

133
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:41,528
I cannot even kill you.

134
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,516
You are an invaluable criminal.

135
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:47,168
Oh, Onii-chan!

136
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:50,105
What you make on this roof,

137
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,725
Instead of waiting inside?

138
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:54,974
One never knows.

139
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,962
You could be malignant and pass by above.

140
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:58,885
Shaow!

141
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:02,108
You are rather careful kind.

142
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:05,349
It is important to remain on its guards.

143
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:09,310
By the way, it is what this trick behind you?

144
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:21,346
What a low blow!

145
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:25,997
Ca suits me!

146
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,958
I am the boss of the gangsters of my city.

147
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,338
Hein?

148
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:45,554
Where did Luffy pass?

149
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:48,794
Do not know.

150
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,403
“Do not know”?!

151
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:55,173
What one makes if it fell to water?!

152
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,630
It is not possible.

153
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,074
It was there still a minute ago.

154
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:03,131
Not true, Chopper?

155
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,441
Hein? Yes.

156
00:14:06,002 --> 00:14:07,782
It is not an answer!

157
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:11,173
I worry because a person who is supposed being there it is not.

158
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:14,395
It east can be wedged in the chimney of Rocketman.

159
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:15,484
Ouais, like me when…

160
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,282
Chopper, dumb!

161
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:30,914
Await us, Robin!

162
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,592
And Usopp…

163
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,229
Try out the world of Ramen Kenpo!

164
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:43,403
More power, you speak.

165
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,744
Its-its-saaa! Eat that!

166
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:51,947
Ramen Kenpou Tonkotsu Spank!!
(tonkotsu = piece of pig for ramen)

167
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,422
It is right the fist of a greenhorn become larger.

168
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:06,501
Its-its-saaa! Wait a little!

169
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,233
I… I am wedged!

170
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:22,515
Hopper!

171
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:32,185
Its-its-saaa!

172
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:37,019
Imbecile! You were made have by my Ramen Kenpo!

173
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,981
A leg and an arm stuck in the ramen! Which error.

174
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:46,856
You dared to strike me presently!

175
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,275
Why you take the giddiness, jerk?!

176
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:09,318
You still tried to spin me the tournis with your eyebrows!

177
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,541
You will pay it!!

178
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,876
Its-its-saaa!

179
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,081
Make shit!

180
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,961
My arm and my leg are wedged!

181
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,469
In this state, I cannot not counteracted.

182
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:35,302
((Human noodle Press))

183
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:35,302
Drunk Men Near!!

184
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,309
It is not finished!

185
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,843
Still!

186
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:47,136
Still!

187
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,512
Still!

188
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:49,838
Still!

189
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:51,148
Still!

190
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,040
Finally released.

191
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,376
Its-its-saaa!

192
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,881
Me under regard not, imbecile!

193
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:15,960
It is my Ramen Kenpo of insane, of insane!

194
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:20,164
If I attack I will stick myself in the ramen.

195
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:22,934
I should not touch this ramen.

196
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,857
In here still!

197
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:33,361
Ramen Gyouza Set Clapping

198
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,811
Therefore, there is one place to aim.

199
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,497
Escalope

200
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,288
Ramen Beam!

201
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,675
Its-its-saaa!

202
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,173
I do not have weak points!

203
00:18:06,263 --> 00:18:08,425
I observe you since presently.

204
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:11,090
Your style of combat uses only your feet.

205
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,964
If you cannot be useful to you about it, you can nothing make!

206
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:16,398
Its-its-saaa!

207
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:17,615
Useless, useless!

208
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,833
No matter what you make, you will stick yourself to my combination!

209
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,079
Try to avoid that!

210
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:31,947
Ramen Kenpou Fukumen Spank!!
(snap double-noodle)

211
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:01,471
1.4 mm pasta, fedelline.

212
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:04,953
Lifting?

213
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,486
Ah! My noodle fists are of pieces!

214
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:17,187
Usually in a combat, I use neither hands, nor knives,

215
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:20,481
because it is crowned for a cook

216
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:23,586
But since that one is in a kitchen…

217
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:26,049
and that you make use of food…

218
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,741
it is another history.

219
00:19:29,943 --> 00:19:33,072
You are more awkward than I thought it!

220
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:36,385
Senmen Muchi!!
(whip of 1000 noodles)

221
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,807
You are played it cool, small pretentious!

222
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,424
An amateur who doesnot can cook do not should handle the knives of the others!

223
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,138
They are different from the knives which a rabble as uses you!

224
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,998
Afflicted to be pretentious.

225
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:01,376
It is not to excuse me

226
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:05,510
But I will show you

227
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,239
the sentence “special couteau de cuisine”

228
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:13,988
of a cook of first class…

229
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:20,909
Shaow!

230
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:21,631
Soru

231
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,483
Strong Hammer

232
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:28,430
Kami-e

233
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:34,473
Rankyaku

234
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:41,877
Shaow!

235
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:48,457
Fresh Fire

236
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:51,429
Soru

237
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,220
It is what its problem? It jumped to the sea!

238
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:00,309
Geppou

239
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,477
How did it can leap in the open air?

240
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,072
I really do not include/understand!

241
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:11,959
Why Rankyaku did not cut it?

242
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:14,980
There is something of odd with its body, shaow.

243
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:17,733
Jerk…

244
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:18,858
with the Juste…

245
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,829
what you are?!

246
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:53,591
Long nose-kun?!

247
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,458
Why are you there?

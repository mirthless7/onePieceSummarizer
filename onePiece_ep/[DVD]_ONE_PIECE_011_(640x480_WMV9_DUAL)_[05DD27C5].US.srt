To have fortune, fame and
power,

00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:08,979
the king of pirates
rules the whole world!

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,850
Before he was beheaded, Gold Roger said:
"Send everybody out to sea."

4
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:14,852
<i>"Do you want my fortune?</i>

5
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:16,654
<i>"I can give it all to you.</i>

6
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:20,156
<i>"But you have to search
the whole world for it!"</i>

7
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:27,498
All the men chasing dreams
along the "Grand Line".

8
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:31,602
It means the time has come,
the time for all pirates!

Going to search for our desires

Filled with excitement,
I take the helm

14
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,436
If we can prove the
dusty old treasure map

15
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:12,509
Then it's not a legend anymore!

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,182
It's alright if our personal problems

17
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:23,320
Get on someone else's nerves

18
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:26,554
Because we think about them too much

19
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:32,763
Gathering up all of our dreams

20
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:38,269
And going to search for our desires

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,946
A coin in the pocket,

22
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,388
We are!

23
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:07,997
You are nothing more than
a filthy pirate's son.

24
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,838
How dare you say I am low...

25
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:19,475
I am sorry for you, Usopp.
You must hate his guts.

26
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:22,545
You must hate you irresponsible
and selfish father

27
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:26,816
who values money
more than you!

28
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:30,914
Stop saying bad things
about my father!

29
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:03,685

to inherit the money.

So is Luffy.

36
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:10,887
He was very frustrated.

37
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:14,966
Whenever he's in a bad mood,
he goes to the beach.

38
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,277
Captain!

39
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:32,526
What's this?
Luffy's not with him.

40
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,075
Captain!
Whoa!

41
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,660
Where's Luffy?
Wasn't he with you
at the beach?

42
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:48,115
Is he still angry about
what the butler said
about his father?

43
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,260
Search me.

44
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,629
I don't think so!
Did you see his face?

45
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,498
Something must've
happened at the beach!

46
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:57,943
He's pale as a ghost!
Something ain't right!

47
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:01,383
Hey!
How can I get to the beach?

48
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:03,973
I smell trouble!

49
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,108
Something going on
at the beach!

50
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,544
Time for Usopp's pirates
to take action!

51
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:11,247
I know!
How do I get there?

52
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:28,030
Everybody listen!

53
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,867
The pirates are coming!

54
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:39,308
They're coming
tomorrow morning!

55
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,644
Run for your lives!

56
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:42,945
Everyone!

57
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,914
What are you waiting for?

58
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:47,026
Everyone!

59
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:58,561
Hey Usopp!
That's enough!

60
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:01,664
That's it for today!

61
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:05,768
No, no!
It's the truth this time!

62
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,838
That's what you always say!

63
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:13,009
If you were so honest
like Klahadore,
we would believe you!

64
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,751
<i>Nobody will believe him.</i>

65
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:23,419
<i>Let's do it tomorrow morning, Django.</i>

66
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,595
<i>Attack when the day breaks.</i>

67
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:27,790
<i>Bastard!</i>

68
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:32,560
<i>Now I know why they ignored me!
He knows no one believes me!</i>

69
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:41,123
Here it is...

70
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,841
The special glasses you ordered
from the optician in the next town.

71
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:48,244
I brought them for you.

72
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:49,876
It's perfect!

73
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:55,106
Thanks so much for your help.

74
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:02,858
It is a present, isn't it?

75
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,960
Yes.

76
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:08,431
Tomorrow is the 3rd anniversary
of Klahadore coming to our house.

77
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,267
He takes a good care of me.

78
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,637
- Klahadore must be glad.
- He is.

79
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,409
Everyone, believe me!

80
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,020
The pirates are coming
tomorrow morning!

81
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:25,881
If we'd taken what
he said seriously...

82
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:28,384
...we would have
escaped a hundred times!

83
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:29,719
Trust me!

84
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,153
Run away!

85
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,256
You will get yourselves killed!

86
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,757
It's true!

87
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:40,324
You have nowhere
to run this time!

88
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,334
Bastards!

89
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,076
Run!
Don't let him escape!

90
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:52,641
Here it is.

91
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:55,978
The captain always comes
here to calm down.

92
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,574
It's kind of cozy here.

93
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,915
The straw-hat man is not here.

94
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,654
It's very dangerous!

95
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:16,076
Be careful, Nami.

96
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:24,131
Hey, look!

97
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,441
What?

98
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:27,543
I found the straw-hat man!

99
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,804
He's upside-down!

100
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:37,932
Luffy, what's wrong?

101
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,419
- He fell down.
- And died!

102
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,372
No wonder the Captain
behaved like that!

103
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,948
Quiet!

104
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,324
That jerk.

105
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,820
Good morning!

106
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,166
Usopp?

107
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:50,691
I thought you're not
coming anymore.

108
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:56,732
Get out now, Kaya!

109
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,186
Or you will be killed!

110
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:01,493
What's wrong?

111
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,006
You've been cheated!

112
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:06,049
That butler is actually a pirate!

113
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:16,642
Wait a second, is this a joke?

114
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:19,989
It is not!

115
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,060
I heard him myself!

116
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:29,165
Klahadore infiltrated
your house for your wealth.

117
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:33,549
He acted like a butler
the last three years.
What he wanted was your wealth.

118
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,614
What are you talking about, Usopp?

119
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:43,713
He says his pirate crew
will be here tomorrow morning!

120
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:57,210
He's a wicked guy!
Run away immediately!

121
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:02,387
What you just said
was too frightening...

122
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:05,230
...but you shouldn't have
lied about that.

123
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,030
This is not your style.

124
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:12,235
No, it's true!

125
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:17,078
True!

126
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:21,176
It's really true!

127
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,800
What?
Miss Kaya is going to be killed?

128
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,141
The village will be under attack!
Is it true?

129
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:45,179
That's what he says.

130
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:52,084
But why are you are sleeping here?

131
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,350
I don't know myself!

132
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:57,486
I was standing over the cliff.

133
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:59,883
Why am I here?

134
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,790
No wonder he's so nasty!

135
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,861
So that's why the captain ran off
with a grim face!

136
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:08,631
Isn't that good to have heard about it?

137
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:11,533
We can run away safe.
The enemies are stupid!

138
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:14,637
Right!
Then we better go now!

139
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:18,974
Yes, go pack your belongings!
And hurry!

140
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:25,948
Oh no!

141
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,016
What's wrong?

142
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:30,909
Go buy something to eat
before the butcher runs away!

143
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:34,348
That's not the problem.

144
00:12:40,263 --> 00:12:43,757
Usopp?

145
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:48,095
<i>What's your adventure story today?</i>

146
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:53,007
Today...

147
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:54,810
<i>Yes!</i>

148
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:58,213
<i>I'll tell you what happened
when I was 5 years old.</i>

149
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:03,185
<i>I fought with a goldfish
that lived in south seas.</i>

150
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:04,853
Goldfish?

151
00:13:04,854 --> 00:13:06,355
<i>You were battling with a goldfish?</i>

152
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:07,589
Yes!

153
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,792
<i>It was so big,
even your aquarium
isn't big enough for it!</i>

154
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:22,604
<i>First of all,
its poop was really huge.</i>

155
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:28,711
<i>I thought it was land and I
even moored my ship to it!</i>

156
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:30,512
It looked fake.

157
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:32,381
Sounds fake, right?

158
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:36,343
<i>But it was real.</i>

159
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:45,394
<i>Then I started a
fire to dry my clothes.
Big mistake.</i>

160
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:46,095
Why?

161
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:51,100
The fish was almost frightened to death.
The fire was burning the fish.

162
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,835
How did it do?

163
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,737
It had no choice, I guess.

164
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:59,302
<i>Because it was almost burned
and became a grilled goldfish!</i>

165
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,579
I...
I meant to like...

166
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,347
The lie you made...

167
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,247
Why didn't you say so?

168
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:23,844
No!
I don't intend to take
revenge on Klahadore.

169
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,021
Why?
Why do you say so?

170
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:30,013
Kaya, I...

171
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:40,759
Miss!
What happened?

172
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,901
Run as fast as you can, Kaya!

173
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,098
Don't do that, Usopp!

174
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,818
Release her!

175
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,467
You must trust me!

176
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,636
Flee this village now...

177
00:15:00,637 --> 00:15:02,594
...before the butler returns!

178
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,778
Stop it!

179
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,456
Let's go!

180
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,871
You'll see it tomorrow!

181
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:38,830
Hurry!
Please do as I say!

182
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,556
That's awful!

183
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,420
Take your hands off Miss Kaya!

184
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:11,572
Leave him alone!

185
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:28,935
Catch him!
He's kidnapping Miss Kaya!

186
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:40,573
<i>How come...
no one trusts me?</i>

187
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,554
Usopp.

188
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,813
Miss, are you okay?

189
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:10,966
Crew, thanks for your help.

190
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,910
It's been 3 years
since the last time we met.

191
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,104
When this plan is
successfully accomplished...

192
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:19,959
I'll give gifts for everyone
as a tribute.

193
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:24,988
Tomorrow morning,
we destroy the village!

194
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,668
Long live the Captain!

195
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:31,617
<i>Long live the Captain!</i>

196
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:42,755
Who are you?

197
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:45,567
I am Usopp.

198
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,936
<i>I'm a brave sea warrior.</i>

199
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:50,706
<i>They told me
that you're not feeling well.</i>

200
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,342
<i>Let me tell you some stories
and pluck up your courage.</i>

201
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:57,145
Leave me alone!
Or I'll yell for help!

202
00:17:57,146 --> 00:18:01,983
I know it's not my business.

203
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:04,353
<i>It happened when I was 3...</i>

204
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:07,990
<i>I saw a whale lying down
and I tried to help him.</i>

205
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:08,824
Whale?

206
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:12,327
Yep, a gigantic whale!
It seemed to have a sore throat.

207
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:16,425
<i>I walked inside its mouth,
but I was mistaken for food!</i>

208
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:20,535
Let's do it tomorrow morning, Django.

209
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:22,719
Attack when the day breaks.

210
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,509
Captain!

211
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:36,837
Hi guys!

212
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:40,592
Hi!

213
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,760
You're still alive!

214
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,061
Still alive?

215
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:47,541
Yes, I just got up!

216
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,115
He was in a deep sleep.

217
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:52,068
Don't worry about him, Captain,
we already know!

218
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,887
Tell everyone
about the pirates!

219
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,777
Tell everyone?

220
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,513
That's awful!

221
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:09,903
That's what you always say!

222
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:17,515
If you were so honest
like Klahadore,
we would believe you!

223
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,778
I'm lying again!

224
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:42,116
I hate that butler,
so I portrayed him as a pirate!

225
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:47,392
The straw-hat man
was in cahoots with the captain!

226
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:53,646
What's up?

227
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,484
Captain, I don't like
what you did.

228
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,234
Me either.
>> Me too.

229
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:01,303
Even if the butler was so nasty,

230
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:04,807
the Captain should never
make up stories about anyone.

231
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:09,344
I used to respect the captain.

232
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:11,453
- Captain, I was wrong about you.
- So was I!

233
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,315
Let's go home.

234
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:15,250
It's about time for dinner.

235
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,744
What are we having today?

236
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,968
There.
That oughta do it.

237
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,378
Why did you do it?

238
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:44,733
Because I am a liar.

239
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:50,720
No one would ever believe me.

240
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,536
I was too naive.

241
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:56,886
But still, that was the truth.

242
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:02,298
The pirates are coming, aren't they?

243
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:04,700
Yes, they are coming.

244
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:07,370
But everyone thought
that I was lying.

245
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:12,231
They thought that
tomorrow's gonna be
another peaceful day.

246
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:21,984
So I'd like to fight with the pirates!
Make the whole thing a lie!

247
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:26,719
That's what I'm supposed to do!

248
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:30,660
I got shot in the arm!

249
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:33,429
I got chased by a broom!

250
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,098
But this is my village!

251
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,062
I love it so much!

252
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:42,571
I want to protect everyone!

253
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,674
You are such a hypocrite.

254
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:47,410
You sent your friends home
so that you could come alone.

255
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:50,780
Don't forget, The treasures belong to me!

256
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:53,282
Okay, we are in!

257
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:58,054
You're willing to join me?
Why?

258
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,923
How big is the enemy's crew?

259
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:03,226
You look scared.

260
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:05,194
No, I'm not!

261
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:09,164
I don't care how many do they have!

262
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:12,935
Because I'm the brave Captain Usopp!

263
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,841
This is for real!

264
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:20,910
Our enemy is Kuro's Pirates!

265
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:23,980
So what?

266
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:28,918
You got a problem with that?
Do you? Do you?

267
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,653
We are not laughing at you.

268
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:33,887
We just think you're good.

269
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:37,852
I just feel sympathy,
though I'll risk my life to help you!

270
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:47,297
You'll... do this for me?

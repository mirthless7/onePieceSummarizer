1
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:00,460
Luffy in anger!

2
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:00,460
A dirty trick in a Crowned Duel!

3
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,230
It received it on the helmet!

4
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,340
If it had not missed it little,
it was assured death!

5
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,740
Which combat…

6
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,440
Each attack aims

7
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,480
the point vital of the adversary!

8
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,730
And that made 100 years that they do test entretuer like that?

9
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,060
But it is a good thing!

10
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,060
One can escape now.

11
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,930
Allons-y.

12
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,150
Usopp?

13
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,520
Incredible.

14
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,610
Reason?

15
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,040
I forgot it!

16
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,090
They do not even have reason,

17
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,770
and they continue to fight like that.

18
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,720
Which combat the weak ones.

19
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,600
Connery!

20
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,470
It is a true combat of men.

21
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,850
What do you want to say?

22
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:24,480
It is as if they had a flag of warrior who floats in their heart.

23
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
And this flag is even more important than their own life.

24
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,360
They do not want to in no case that this flag falls.

25
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,950
It is for that they have continued to fight for 100 years!

26
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,620
You include/understand?

27
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,290
It is not a revenge.

28
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,380
It is a combat for the honor!

29
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,260
Card-indexes me.

30
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,630
Why would I be interested by such a weak trick?

31
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,840
Hurry!

32
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,680
I will remain still a little.

33
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,930
It is exactly that.

34
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,730
I want to become a “honest warrior of the seas”!

35
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,730
I want to be a valiant knight and proud warlike like them!

36
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,950
Hein? Then you want to become a Giant?

37
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,120
NOT!!!!

38
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,310
You did not listen to a word of what I said?

39
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,150
You stays not judicious to look at them there?

40
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,950
If these warriors have a village,

41
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,450
I would like to go much there!

42
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,230
I have a superb sight from here!

43
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,250
They could see you, Miss Valentine!

44
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,460
Dispatch you to go down!

45
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,030
They is good, Mr. 5.

46
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,700
They are completely absorbed by their combat.

47
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,780
They do not pay attention to me at all.

48
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,200
Do not discuss!
Go down from there immediately!

49
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,580
Well, very well.

50
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,370
Well, just to know if you included/understood well.

51
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,960
<b>C' is a job of 8} 200,000,000.</b>

52
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,920
Of course.

53
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,380
Although I would not be charmed to obey the orders of Mr. 3.

54
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,090
Ouais. Allons-y!

55
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes.

56
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,450
We… remained too a long time distant from our fatherland,

57
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,160
Dorry.

58
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
This is why after you to have beaten,

59
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,920
I will turn over to Elbaf,

60
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,250
Brogy.

61
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,610
73,466 engagements.

62
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,400
73,466 ties.

63
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,990
You know what, Dorry! I have two small guests who offered gnôle to me!

64
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,200
Super!

65
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,200
Ca makes a lease that I drank some more!
Give-me of too!

66
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,180
It was what this noise?

67
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,390
Initially these earthquakes, then that?

68
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,690
Would there be things even stranger than these dinosaurs in this jungle?

69
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,610
In any case, if I catch this trick,

70
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,860
I am sure that I will beat this pretentious of cook.

71
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,940
It was what this bird?

72
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,990
This thing all maigrelette and at all appetizing.

73
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,790
Even if I said that I would bring back a large prey, I am interested more by his quality.

74
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,330
That one was large, but it was at all appetizing.

75
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,500
This cretin cannot include/understand this type of things.

76
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,680
Then like is that, these guests with you?

77
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,980
There are a woman and a type with a long conk.

78
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,560
Usopp and Nami!

79
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,600
I thought that they did not want to go down from the boat!

80
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,690
They did not can resist the call of the adventure either them!

81
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,690
Does Ca want to say that this gnôle is with you makes some?

82
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,780
In the fact, Dorry-San…

83
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,950
It is true that it is necessary one year whole so that the Log is reloaded?

84
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,590
You did not see all the remainders of the small men in the corner?

85
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,220
The majority of the human ones which came here died before their Log was not reloaded.

86
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,760
Some were used as meal with the dinosaurs,

87
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,010
others succumbed to the heat wave,

88
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,140
and y' has some which tried to attack us, but all died.

89
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,530
It would seem that to spend one year on this island is too testing for human.

90
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,110
What can one make?

91
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,160
Even if one manages to survive one year,

92
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,580
who knows what will arrive at my country during all this time?

93
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,460
You are right. It is bloody long a year.

94
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,870
Doesn't Y' have another means, Ossan?

95
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,960
There is only one Eternal Pose here.

96
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,010
But it indicates the direction of our island, Elbaf.

97
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,100
The winner of our combat will gain this Eternal Pose.

98
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,760
You want to try to take it to us of force?

99
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,350
It is not the sorrow.

100
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,890
One does not want to go over there.

101
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,650
All that one wants is to go on the following island.

102
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,360
Not true?

103
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,190
Yes.

104
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,780
If one deviates from the way towards Arabasta,

105
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,490
there is no more reason to continue.

106
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,530
You see?

107
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,610
Eh why not to try well, then to find your way with the conk?

108
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,540
If the chance is with you, perhaps you will succeed.

109
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,010
Why not!

110
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,510
One could do it!

111
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,190
Ca recalls me it is very a long time, a type which left before the Log is not reloaded.

112
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,520
And what did it arrive to him?

113
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,230
How do you want that I know it?

114
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,820
It must have succeeded in reaching the following island!

115
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,110
Of course!

116
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,620
What is there the funny one?

117
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,500
How can they leave such conneries?

118
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,610
Warlike brave men of the seas?

119
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,360
About what you do speak?

120
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,110
You two!

121
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,860
One day, I will become like you!

122
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,240
Hein? You want to become a Giant?

123
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,700
You see?

124
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,810
Not, at all!

125
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,890
Like a warrior of Elbaf,

126
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,250
I want to live a life of honor and pride!

127
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,430
I see!

128
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,050
Eh well, it is because we live much longer than you

129
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,720
that we take care in the way in which we want to die.

130
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,270
After all, the material richnesses, goods and the life end up disappearing one day or the other.

131
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,820
But, for a Warrior of Elbaf,
to die by preserving its honor,

132
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,900
it is a worthy death.

133
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,700
On the ground of Elbaf, this honor represents a treasure eternal.

134
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,700
Is the honor a treasure?

135
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,250
They is marvellous!

136
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,740
It is decided!

137
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,790
From now, you will be my Master!

138
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,040
Giant-ossan!

139
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,870
What did it occur?

140
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,320
Why alcohol exploded?

141
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,170
Did alcohol come from our boat?

142
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,590
Ca exploded inside its belly!

143
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,980
It is perhaps other Géant who trapped it?

144
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
You BLIND ES OR WHAT?

145
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,550
They have fought for 100 years,
and you think that it would make a similar thing?

146
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,380
But then which?

147
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,260
It is you…

148
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,470
It is not Brogy.

149
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:05,020
We are both Guerriers valiant knights of Elbaf.

150
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,400
The only suspects they is… you two.

151
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,150
We must flee!

152
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,280
It is irritated too much to listen to us!

153
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,920
To flee will not be used for nothing.

154
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,420
Take that and hides.

155
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,540
Do not say to me that

156
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,660
you will fight against him?

157
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,510
I am afflicted,

158
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,340
but I will have to fold back you your cackle.

159
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,840
Both, stop!
I beg you!

160
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,850
Dorry-San, please, listen to me!

161
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,390
One really does not know why alcohol exploded!

162
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,020
I beg you, you do not carry!

163
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,940
You calm!

164
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,730
You do not see that you have serious internal damage?

165
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,590
Poor wretches little runts…

166
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,070
You believe… that you can leave yourselves there like that?

167
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,860
Afflicted.

168
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,570
LUFFY-SAN!

169
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,660
A Fruit of the Demon…

170
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,200
You have this kind to be able?

171
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,890
Poor wretch small thing!

172
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,480
Are Luffy-San, you well?

173
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:52,970
Ossan?

174
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,450
I believe… that it is alive.

175
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,330
If you had not done that, it would never have been calmed.

176
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,880
I am furax!

177
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,210
This alcohol… as it said…

178
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,790
It is not other Géant who did it.

179
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,920
And it is impossible that one of my companions could make such an atrocious thing.

180
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,630
Then… which?

181
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,940
Someone else is here…

182
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,500
on this island.

183
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,140
The victory, that is also exploited the psychological level.

184
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,880
In this moment, they are destabilized completions

185
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,870
because of this unexplainable
“Bomb Service” of an invisible enemy.

186
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,110
One started with our first target,
Dorry the Blue Ogre.

187
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,830
I knew that the explosive load of the bomb would not have killed it.

188
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,670
The explosion inside its belly
however caused serious damage.

189
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,050
We do not have any more but to await their next combat.

190
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,200
While waiting, we can taste a cup of tea.

191
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,010
To use a Giant to have the other, hein?

192
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,830
Completely.

193
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,390
It is an underhand manner to make the things.

194
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,100
These warriors are not the so various only wild boars.

195
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,980
As long as they are not attacked face,

196
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,360
they are easy to beat.

197
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,760
Consequently, even if we do not have their force,

198
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,910
we can balance our chances by using our intelligence.

199
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,220
It is not true.

200
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,100
You cannot be useful to you
yourself, Goldenweek Miss?

201
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,350
And, how will you make to remove you from the pirates of Straw hat?

202
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,810
Straw hat?

203
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,150
Do Oh, you want to speak about small strike who discovered the secrecy of the Boss?

204
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,780
Eh well, I believe that the strategy to divide for better reigning will be ideal.

205
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,280
I reserve my “Service Set to them”.

206
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,710
As I always say, it is necessary to use “the inventive solutions with the service of the crime”.

207
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,930
There are so much ways of overcoming its adversary without raising the little finger.

208
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,550
Mr. 3, a second.

209
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,920
Yes, me too.

210
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,260
YOU DO NOT HAVE SAME STEP TAKEN TIME TO ENJOY IT?

211
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,860
The volcano…

212
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,000
Ca wants to say…

213
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,940
They are not good.

214
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,400
Time is counted.

215
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,910
Afflicted.

216
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,620
Release me!
I said that I was sorry!

217
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,050
I do not have time to play!

218
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,660
The gong resounded.

219
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,960
And not only one piece of meat?
Which good joke.

220
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,500
Good blood…

221
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,520
It is the signal.

222
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,560
It is quite today excited.

223
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,690
Where do you go?

224
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,170
Your wounds of the last meeting are not…

225
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,380
And then?

226
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
My adversary is in the same state.

227
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,790
There is no excuse to have in a combat without mercy, it would be a blow to lose the face!

228
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,260
He! Wait, Ossan!

229
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,390
Where you go?

230
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,850
Do not move, Dorry-San!
You rest!

231
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,020
If you made too many efforts, you will die!

232
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,690
I am the Dorry Warrior.

233
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,730
And I will make in kind

234
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,190
that this combat does not tarnish the honor of Elbaf!

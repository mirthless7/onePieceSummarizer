1
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,030
Then, how long that will last?

2
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,130
We can pay as long as you will want. One has full of money.

3
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,260
The wounds of the engagements are too deep.

4
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,239
Does that want to say that repair will take much time?

5
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,030
Not.

6
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,930
To be honest, your boat…

7
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,450
Is not reparable, even by us.

8
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,750
It is not possible…

9
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,080
But until now,
we always could sail without problems!

10
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,530
Even if we repair it best than we can, the chances to reach the next island are of…

11
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,090
Zero.

12
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,080
Merry, you…

13
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,870
Donot can sail really any more?

14
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:09,750
Kidnapping of pirate.
Last days of the pirate boat.

15
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,520
Good…

16
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,790
Afflicted, Sanji. I was distracted by the books.

17
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,100
You do not have to excuse yourself for that.

18
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,110
I am certain that the person with Robin-chan had an human form.

19
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,239
Then, which was this camouflaged guy?

20
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,929
It is strange also that they disappear also suddenly.

21
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,110
Ouais, the odor of Robin also evaporated.

22
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,290
I hope that nothing low register did not arrive,

23
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,859
But I feel badly at ease.

24
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,939
Hein? You require that I examine you?

25
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,700
I AM NOT SICK!

26
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,850
The words of Ao Kiji trottent me in the head.

27
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,450
He said what?

28
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,100
He spoke about a serious event in the past of Robin-chan.

29
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,930
And it added that we will regret it one day.

30
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,200
Now that you say it…

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,289
Could there be a relationship with the disappearance of Robin?

32
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,370
I know anything of it.

33
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,519
In any case, that is not used for nothing to remain the arms crosseds here.

34
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,410
Let us turn over to Merry for the moment.

35
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,680
If all is well, perhaps it will return.

36
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,540
It is true.

37
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,230
More quickly, please.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,039
Merry is foutu?!

39
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,200
Why?!

40
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,480
Do not be you not the best naval engineers?!

41
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,909
Look at, money, one has some more than enough!

42
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,910
The money does not have importance.

43
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,660
It does not matter what you will pay,

44
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,390
This boat cannot return in its country of origin.

45
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,799
I wonder besides how you could make all this way,

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,319
With a boat in this state.

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,579
What that wants to say?!

48
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,630
It is what the problem with Merry?!

49
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,499
Do you know the role of the “skittle”, dépravée?

50
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,840
Déprav…

51
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,650
The trick at the bottom of the hold?

52
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,760
Yes.

53
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,530
It is the most important element, which leaves the prow to the poop of the boat.

54
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,190
The construction of a boat starts from there.

55
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,180
Then the prow, the poop, the frames comes…

56
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,880
Frames, the stem then the bridge.

57
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,629
All the parts are thoroughly adjusted between them, with the skittle like reference.

58
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,000
It is the showpiece of the boat.

59
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,369
The life of a boat depends on the skittle.

60
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,930
When it is damaged, one cannot replace it.

61
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,110
It would be like building a boat starting from a wreck.

62
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,240
This is why…

63
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,240
Nobody can repair it.

64
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,370
Your boat saw its last days.

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,170
He, did not say a similar thing!

66
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,450
It is however the truth.

67
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,770
Then manufacture a new boat!

68
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,170
Build another Going Merry!

69
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,499
It is also impossible.

70
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,640
Why?!

71
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,030
We could manufacture a similar boat, but…

72
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,500
Strictly to speak, nobody can duplicate a boat.

73
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,550
Everywhere in the world, you will never find two boats identical.

74
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,979
What does that want to say?

75
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,890
Did you already see two identical trees?

76
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,779
Most of the time, a ship is built containing boards.

77
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,990
The size and the shape of the boat are then determined by the type of wood used.

78
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,520
This is why we cannot build a boat with identical with the same sketches.

79
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,810
If we manufacture a boat like that one…

80
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,510
That which will realize that it is not exactly the same one…

81
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,500
Will be doubtless, you!

82
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,450
Impossible…

83
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,510
Then we cannot sail really any more with Going Merry?

84
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,830
It is true… Either you wait until it runs, or…

85
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,870
You disassemble it immediately.

86
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,910
A caravel!

87
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,820
What a splendid boat!

88
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,439
Yosh, they is good!

89
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,320
Maintaining the boat pirate, Going Merry, is ready!

90
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,350
Nmaaa… The life of this boat touches at its end.

91
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,350
Isn't this the occasion?

92
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,650
Give up it and buy a new boat.

93
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,140
You have money.

94
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,050
I intended to say that it was a caravel.

95
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,380
To sail with an old boat like this one, would become too difficult.

96
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,030
Not, we do not intend to change.

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,120
Luffy.

98
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,740
It is our…

99
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,450
It is our boat, Going Merry!

100
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,060
If we repair it, it will still sail!

101
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,719
They is good! Still today, we sailed without problem!

102
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,930
And of a blow, to say that we cannot sail any more…

103
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,400
I cannot believe in it!

104
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,050
You said that because you do not know with what a not this boat is robust!

105
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,460
Do you intend to sail until his shipwreck?

106
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,640
Ca surprises me…

107
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,550
However, you are the captain of this boat?!

108
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,290
This conversation is finished until new order.

109
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,930
Reflect there and return when you decide to buy a boat.

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,080
I will help you.

111
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,010
If you can pay 300 million, we will be able to build our new model of boat.

112
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,090
Kalifa.

113
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,090
Yes…

114
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,540
Throw an eye on top…

115
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,909
It is a catalog of all our range.

116
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,460
The standard prices are listed there.

117
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,990
Iceberg-san.

118
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,070
We have customers at the entry.

119
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,610
There is however no go envisaged.

120
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,540
It would seem that they are still representatives of the government.

121
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,260
Do I have to say to them to leave?

122
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,440
Nmaaa, ouais.

123
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,780
Say their that I am not there.

124
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,389
Another thing still…

125
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,569
Your hair draws up straight to the alarm clock, Lulu.

126
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,959
Oops, that fears.

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,299
Afflicted.

128
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,480
Thus I will say to them to leave.

129
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,949
Go ahead.

130
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,700
Wait a little, Iceberg-kun.

131
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,330
Then you are there.

132
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,869
Oi, you, hide you!

133
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,500
They are representatives of the government!

134
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,329
Nmaa, Re-hello, Kogi…

135
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,999
I am absent today.

136
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes, you are it!

137
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,149
Good, I made all this way up to now by Umi Ressha.

138
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,360
I do not want to be of bad mood.

139
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,070
I do not know why, but that feels the pirate here.

140
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,969
Ca does not do anything.

141
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,029
In any event, I came to speak to you.

142
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,950
You me drunk! You break!

143
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,660
Be to you a kid?

144
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
I am incontestably an adult.

145
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,159
Would not be so obstinate.

146
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,990
Today, we have something of special to ask you. I will like that you listenings.

147
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,610
Come, will discuss into private.

148
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,060
They will thus stop never.

149
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,380
What do they want to him with Iceberg-san?

150
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,159
Ca does not concern us.

151
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,599
Surely a political matter.

152
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,139
Would I owe them botter the bottom?

153
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,160
Drop, they belong to the international government.

154
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,880
What?

155
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,160
What is there?

156
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,630
I noticed a trick when one hid with the bags.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,390
They are light.

158
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Why?

159
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,609
Oh, stops your conneries.

160
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,110
They cannot be light inside with as much money.

161
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,420
It is what these cries?

162
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,030
Baka, why you ridges as much of noise?!

163
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,900
Oi, young girl, while sitting you like that, one will see…

164
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,900
It is…

165
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,900
Impossible…

166
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,460
Ca may not be…

167
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,929
200 MILLION BERRYS!

168
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,299
FLOWN AWAY! THEY SE ARE FLOWN AWAY!

169
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,170
While looking at more closely, they are not our bags!

170
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,820
Oi, you ridges far too much noise. What does it occur?

171
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,719
The money disappeared.

172
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,599
More no trace.

173
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,399
What?

174
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,669
Paulee, it is still you?!

175
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,739
It is not me!

176
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,489
Really?!

177
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,289
How if I were a liar, whore!

178
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,049
Be really sure for you of you?!

179
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,059
Which din.

180
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,639
I am really, really sure!

181
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,679
By the way, Kaku, were you with Franky Family?

182
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,569
Really, really, really?!

183
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,949
Hey, await… ouch!

184
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,599
It is the plain truth, it is not me!

185
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,970
What do you tell?

186
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,960
I did not see Franky Family.

187
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,719
Odd,

188
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,020
I was however sure to have seen your long nose.

189
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,020
Wait a little!

190
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,590
It is Usopp!

191
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,829
It with Franky Family was?!

192
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,680
Either it accompanied them,

193
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,129
either it was made trimbaler.

194
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,869
It is a kidnapping!

195
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,549
Luffy, we must quickly find it!

196
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,640
Included/understood!

197
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,029
He, wait!

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,360
Where you will seek, Luffy?!

199
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,200
Await me, Usopp, the money!

200
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,240
Is He, where the cushy job of Franky Family?

201
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
It is more one building site which a cushy job.

202
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:57,380
Of where you accosted on the rock coast, it is the house in the North-East called…

203
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,250
Franky House.

204
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:17,490
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

205
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,040
Luffy!

206
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,250
Luffy!

207
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,880
Good, it will never find anybody all alone!

208
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,539
I do not have time to seek Luffy.

209
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,460
I must initially bring back the money to the boat.

210
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,759
If I make them understand that they have only 200 million and that I have 100 million with me…

211
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,390
They will leave to my research.

212
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,590
Please, Yagara-chan! The shortest way towards the store of hiring of bulldozer!

213
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,200
I take Zoro and the others with the passage and I will tell them.

214
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,640
Franky Family, you should never have flown of the pirates!

215
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,720
First level, here the street of the market!

216
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,490
Advance prudently!

217
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,530
I count on you, Yagara-chan!

218
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,380
It is what that?

219
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,519
Look at where you go, Born-chan!

220
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,930
Afflicted!

221
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,510
I hope that Usopp succeeded in escaping.

222
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,789
Ca fears.

223
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,279
From which does this type come?

224
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,859
Oi, somebody knows this guy?!

225
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,140
There are many people.

226
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,970
Yagara-chan, stops one moment!

227
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,460
Usopp!

228
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,409
Usopp, hold good!

229
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,220
He, you are well?!

230
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,479
He! He!

231
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,339
Usopp! Usopp!

232
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,369
Oi, are you pirates?

233
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,960
The farm! There remain not planted!

234
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,630
Was Usopp, it Franky Family?

235
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,700
It was them?!

236
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,140
Yes… Because I am too weak…

237
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,230
They took…

238
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,950
All money.

239
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,220
Nami…

240
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,580
How will I… tell that with the others, now?

241
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,690
Just at the moment when… we could finally repair Merry…

242
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,550
I have shame so much…

243
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,770
Putaiiin…

244
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,640
Usopp.

245
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,870
I include/understand. It is not serious for the money.

246
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,230
We will recover it, all together.

247
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,870
It is dirtily reached.

248
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,000
I will make better not move it.

249
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,670
Usopp, remains there for the moment.

250
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,450
I turn over quickly to the boat to call of the assistance.

251
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,490
I will also ask Chopper to look after you.

252
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,900
Do not make any you for the money.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,679
It appears that they hide in the surroundings.

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,930
One will deal with them and will put an end to all that!

255
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,050
He, it is not a spectacle!

256
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,120
Usopp, continues to lie here, ok?!

257
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,470
I return as fast as possible!

258
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,830
More quickly, Yagara-chan!

259
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,619
It is insane this bulldozer!

260
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,740
He!

261
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,950
Just at the moment when we could finally repair Merry…

262
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,460
It does not matter what you will pay, this boat cannot return in its country of origin.

263
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,400
Either we decide to buy a new boat…

264
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,820
Either we repair and improve ourself Merry…

265
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,430
If we do not put the totality of the 300 million in the boat…

266
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,770
To sail possible further will be certainly difficult.

267
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,440
We need really this money!

268
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,210
We must find it!

269
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,990
It is true?

270
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,890
It is what the naval engineer said.

271
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,090
This boat…

272
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,690
Is not reparable?

273
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,119
Even if we have money?

274
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,050
But then… What will it arrive at Merry?

275
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:58,260
Who knows… All will depend how Luffy and the others will react by learning that.

276
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,730
These three there will find surely a solution with the shipyard.

277
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,360
But it is so cruel!

278
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,639
Look at, the boat seems in good state…

279
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,660
And it made us travel of East Blue up to now!

280
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,620
It is for that…

281
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,180
That the men become stronger when they face the difficulties.

282
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,040
But the ships are different.

283
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,770
Their wounds accumulate.

284
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,760
I do not include/understand anything.

285
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,430
How will react Usopp by learning that?

286
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,220
I like Merry!

287
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,190
Like everyone. But the wounds are too deep, it does not have nothing there to make.

288
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,730
I worry for Merry and Robin-chan.

289
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,880
Ca returns nutcase to me.

290
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,120
Everyone!

291
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,010
He, Nami returns!

292
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,430
It seems to be alone.

293
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,430
Where are Luffy and Usopp?

294
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,880
Nami-saan, it occurred something?!

295
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,329
200 million?!

296
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,410
Yes, 200 million!

297
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,200
What do you think about it, Aniki?

298
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,460
Enormous! It is brilliant the guy!

299
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,769
Now that we have as much money…

300
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,969
We will be able to offer what we wish more than all!

301
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,019
Indeed, Aniki.

302
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,489
Our honesty towards you since three years.

303
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,639
We dream some since so many years.

304
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,410
That made so a long time…

305
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,959
If there were a little money, one could bet in the races of Yagara.

306
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,819
And ever mown!

307
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,139
If one reported a setting at price, one could drink and have fun the festival…

308
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,899
And ever mown!

309
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:54,809
We finally collected the 200 million Berrys necessary. So difficult to recover!

310
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,370
Indeed! You made crowned good job!

311
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,949
Then now…

312
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,299
It is not large thing, but here 5 million Berrys, to show you my gratitude.

313
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,650
Drink and eat at will!

314
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,509
It is well our Aniki!

315
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,750
Banzai!

316
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,020
C-C' is what?!

317
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,410
Whore!

318
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,200
Who dares to rub in Franky Family?!

319
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,159
It is this poor guy which one crossed.

320
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,230
What, do you hold still upright?

321
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,819
Return to me the money!

322
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,930
“To me the money”, say you Return?

323
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,830
Does that want to say that you are a man of the Straw hat?

324
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,099
It is him, Aniki!

325
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,980
I wanted to know if a man of Luffy to the Straw hat were so strong that!

326
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,399
But it is only one weakling!

327
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,170
Ca does not concern you!

328
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,659
What it fout?!

329
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,329
I appreciate your courage to want to bring back only the money…

330
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,480
But I cannot you leave it.

331
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,770
Return it to me.

332
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,010
It is…

333
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,600
The money which we go…

334
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,240
to use for…

335
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,320
to repair our boat.

336
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,500
With this money…

337
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,350
We will be able to finally look after the wounds of Merry!

338
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,730
I will not leave it to you!

1
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,540
Luffy and its crew entered
in the Lost Forest of Upper Yard…

2
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,020
Where they face the terrible one
Ordalie of the Bubbles of the Satori Priest.

3
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,880
Meanwhile, Gan Fall is
embanked by the Shura Priest.

4
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,070
KNIGHT OF THE SKY!!!

5
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,789
He, Nami!

6
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,089
You see something of up there?!

7
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,090
It will be a declaration of war
against God Very Powerful Eneru!

8
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,850
Firm your mouth! Your
bad breath escapes.

9
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,869
Here Ordalie of the Love!

10
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,870
THIS MEC EAST SHINGLES!!!

11
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,539
To crush!

12
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:52,470
Let us revive the Flame of Shandia!
Wiper the Warrior

13
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,960
Gan Fall, Former God,
Upper Yard penetrated.

14
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,710
Eneru will be caught some with him.

15
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,889
You think that Gan Fall
projects to defy Eneru?

16
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,700
You believe that this old wreck has
enough tripe to do it?

17
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,020
That there is,
Aisa?

18
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,419
Two votes have just died out.

19
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,379
How?

20
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,809
Hein, Mantra?

21
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,819
Yes.

22
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,390
Very of a blow, at the moment.

23
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,830
It is what your Mantra you said ace, Aisa?

24
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,049
Two was keep silent?

25
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,300
You are sure?

26
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,709
No doubt.

27
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,679
Each one of us knows.

28
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,559
Since it was born…

29
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,710
it has this mysterious gift to feel
remote people, Mantra.

30
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,389
Two votes are
extinct, it is well that?

31
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,199
Yes.

32
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,650
At the same time.

33
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,890
I believe… that it acts
of Gan Fall and a Priest.

34
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,749
They were entretués?

35
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,889
Good work, species of old turned sour.

36
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,559
Ca leaves us three Priests.

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,270
What a aubaine!

38
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,730
It would be said that the Paradise
heard our prayers.

39
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,790
It is the occasion or never
to crush the Priests!

40
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,460
Ouais!

41
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,240
You for the attack prepare
general on Upper Yard!

42
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,140
Ouais!

43
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,050
Today still, Wiper frightens you.

44
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,570
Go, releases maintaining me.

45
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,660
He, Laki! Wait!

46
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,159
What?

47
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,029
It is not Gan Fall
who overcame the Priest.

48
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,420
There are other people over there,
it is they which did that!

49
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,959
Other people?

50
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,629
These inhabitants of the Blue Sea
who are assembled on Skypiea?

51
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,790
I do not know, but
they are very strong!

52
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,250
Then…

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,590
Pay attention.

54
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,869
Of agreement.

55
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,119
Aisa, gives me your bag.

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,949
Hein? Not, I cannot
! It is my secret bag!

57
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,679
There is a treasure inside!

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,070
I know.

59
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,779
I will report a memory to you.

60
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,669
It is true?

61
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,430
Yes.

62
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,890
One finally arrived there.

63
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,359
Us to ridicule at this point…

64
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,249
It is which, these guys?

65
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,329
How it made for
to guess our attacks?

66
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,079
HE!

67
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,369
Luffy! Sanji!

68
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,939
I found the boat!

69
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,250
Quickly! It will leave the forest!

70
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,109
Is Oh, Usopp well?

71
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,360
He, it says that one will lose the boat!

72
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,470
Ca fears! Still a little and
it will reach the exit!

73
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,509
He, come by here and
you with me stud!

74
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,530
With you?

75
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,920
It left!

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,690
ussop has

77
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,659
Perfect! I have it!

78
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,329
Ouah! Be the best for you, Usopp!

79
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,379
Ca hurts, dumbs! You
please me complete or what?

80
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,239
Very well, all on board!

81
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,809
Cretin, I have the back
in crumbs now.

82
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,229
He, you fixed it well.

83
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,589
Nothing is impossible with me.

84
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,979
For once you have an good idea!

85
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,130
You worried for nothing!

86
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,189
Have-HAVE-await!
The cord goes…

87
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,479
Afflicted, Sanji-kun! One
would say well that one will die!

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,090
You are sure?!

89
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,960
Me too?!

90
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,939
Why?

91
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,229
That you serf of lesson.

92
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,440
It… was enough that I catch the boat.

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,420
BoiBil in choua, bwon buiblé Ba Boblêt Bedue… (At all events, one left the Lost Forest…)

94
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,440
I… I cannot swim.

95
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,640
The Knight of the sky…

96
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,719
The funny one of bird also…

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,480
It is true, it has the capacities
of a Fruit of the Demon like me.

98
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,199
Shit!

99
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,680
I cannot save anybody…

100
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,439
It is the end…

101
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,730
I lose consciousness…

102
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,910
Did Satori fail?

103
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,439
It lost the control of its Mantra.

104
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,940
That proves its lack of experience.

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,530
These inhabitants of the Blue Sea
have the air different from the others.

106
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,019
This incident on the Furnace bridge
Sacrificial was not envisaged.

107
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,560
But even if they are escaped,
they will not leave this island.

108
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,140
Now, most important, it is…

109
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,860
Priest of Skypiea
Celestial guard Gedatsu

110
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,410
You hear the sad one
voice of the warrior, Holy?

111
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,479
It does not matter the number of times,
the result is always the same one.

112
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,620
Gan Fall was overcome by Shura,
but Ordalie of the Bubbles failed.

113
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,800
This day proves very animated.

114
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,519
We will not let them pass.

115
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,310
It is stupid to imagine
that they will be able to see God.

116
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,570
The sun goes soon
to sleep on Upper Yard…

117
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,140
Priest of Skypiea Ohm, Celestial Stockbreeder.

118
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,199
But the situation goes
to worsen more and more.

119
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:16,640
Priest of Skypiea
Shura, Celestial Rider

120
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,289
Fugitive or not, that is equal for me!

121
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,990
I finally found somebody
worthy to receive my anger!

122
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,710
Listen to me, warriors!

123
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,349
Upper Yard is plunged in chaos!

124
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,840
We will have never again
an occasion like that one!

125
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,260
Our goal is the Sanctuary of God!

126
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,150
Do not fear Eneru!

127
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,670
The Large Karugara Warrior
we will protect forever!

128
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,589
OUAIS!

129
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,839
Braham!

130
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,269
OUAIS!

131
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,580
Kamakiri!

132
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,239
Genbou!

133
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
Ouais!

134
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,299
Laki!

135
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,249
Yes!

136
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,829
Return in life.

137
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,180
One separates here.

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,929
Us swearwords in front of
Large Karugara Warrior!

139
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,419
To revive the Flame of Shandia!

140
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,510
OUAIS!

141
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,260
You here is, Shandia!

142
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,479
Would this island be…?

143
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,820
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

144
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,820
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

145
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,429
It was what?

146
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,089
An explosion, obviously.

147
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,600
I heard one of them presently,
but this one was different.

148
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,820
Good, we do not stop!

149
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,329
Does all go well for you, Nami?

150
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,609
You acted oddly since
that you are descended from the tree.

151
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,639
What did you see?

152
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
You saw God or what?

153
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,700
At all!

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,320
Even if I say it to you,
you compren…!

155
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,559
Ca becomes ridiculous!

156
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,309
Why this is so difficult
to go on top?!

157
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,110
But it is you who said that
this way would be faster.

158
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,609
Enough lost time,
stir up yourself a little!

159
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,969
What you ace seen at the end?

160
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,179
It does not matter, satisfy you
to follow me!

161
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,260
This way will carry out us
straight to the shore.

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,369
But come to help me!

163
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,729
If you are followed, you are
judicious to go in front.

164
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,659
The shore?

165
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,809
Yes, completely.

166
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,580
I need me
to bring closer to be sure.

167
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,930
Because I always do not arrive
not to believe my eyes of them.

168
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,459
Me either.

169
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,080
Something worries me too me.

170
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,000
I do not have any final proof…

171
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,770
But if my assumption
proved to be true…

172
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,410
that would become interesting.

173
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,520
Very interesting.

174
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,390
My reason to live
would exist indeed.

175
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,460
But for the moment, it
is only one assumption.

176
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,110
Hein?

177
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,390
I am… alive?

178
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,010
Ouiiille!!

179
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,909
The Knight of the Sky!

180
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,869
A doctor! A doctor!

181
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,130
Ah yes, it is me!

182
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,670
God thank you, it is alive.

183
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,290
But, it is strange…

184
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,299
One had run all.

185
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,460
Who left us from there?

186
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,019
Hein? Who?

187
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,210
“God”?

188
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,780
Who said that?!

189
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,039
How…?

190
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,449
We are close to the sea.

191
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,229
Hein?

192
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,609
I hear the waves.

193
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,460
Listen.

194
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
It is true! One is there almost!

195
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,809
One goes there!

196
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,020
Say to us what you ace considering!

197
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,400
It is what these “ahahah”?

198
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,119
I hear another noise
mixed with that of the waves…

199
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,270
Ouais, a noise rather disturbing…

200
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,890
Noise of all one
army which passes to the attack.

201
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,140
A little as one heard in Alabasta.

202
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,739
You believe that one should worry?

203
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,019
Do not make any you for Chopper.

204
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,589
It is left there very well when it wants.

205
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,909
Not him, but it
Captain and others.

206
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,889
Luffy?

207
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,019
After our removal, it has
had to leave to our research.

208
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,769
It was very excited
to come on this island.

209
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,899
I do not know only God
for making…

210
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,509
but it surely does not go us
to let pass also easily.

211
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,670
And then there are these guys who
fight between them, over there.

212
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,009
The situation becomes complicated.

213
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,110
It is certain.

214
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,199
But they will be left there.

215
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,479
There are all our own problems.

216
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,400
They are not while being done
concern for them that they will be helped.

217
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,040
It is true.

218
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,679
He, Nami!

219
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,740
He!

220
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,109
I swear you, Usopp, you make like that!

221
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,389
Of agreement.

222
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,299
“He! Upright, cretin!”

223
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,890
“What? Already the morning?”

224
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,169
It is Completely Zoro!

225
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,140
You finished you
to split the mouth, cretins!

226
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,130
We do not know what is
arrived at Nami-san and Robin-chan…

227
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,609
And for Zoro and Chopper?

228
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,179
There remain still three Priests over there.

229
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,539
They must undergo one of their Ordalies.

230
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,900
“It is Ordalie of the Love.”

231
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,430
For the moment, one must keep
the course on the sacrificial Furnace bridge.

232
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,719
Included/understood?

233
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,839
Boui.
(Yes.)

234
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,740
Soft be unemployed décholé.
(We are sorry.)

235
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,929
Why it has
accelerated of a blow?

236
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,810
Whore, as soon as one arrives
to the sea, it will drink the cup.

237
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,080
Then my eyes had not been mistaken.

238
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,299
Look at that!

239
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,879
He, Nami! I have some enough.

240
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,770
Say to us what occurs…

241
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,109
Not need to make
a drawing, not true?

242
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,540
Look at that…

243
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,560
Doesn't Ca say anything to you?

244
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,740
It is not a fairy tale.

245
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,750
It was seen right this morning.

246
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,189
But what does that want to say?

247
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,829
What this trick which
was in bottom fout here?

248
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,139
It is exactly the same one.

249
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,710
Not, not completely.

250
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,959
It is a piece of it
that we saw in bottom.

251
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,419
A piece?

252
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,559
Ca intrigued me since one moment.

253
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,860
There should not be
of ground on the Sea of Opal.

254
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,820
It was impossible that this island
was formed without ilonimbus.

255
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,460
What wants to say, that this
island which one calls Upper Yard…

256
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,910
was on ground formerly.

257
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,500
I knew that there was some
thing of odd with this house.

258
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,400
There was a stage, but not
of staircase to go up to the first.

259
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,310
And it was no beneficial to build
a house at the edge of a cliff.

260
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,390
The shore was formed afterwards
a tear of the island.

261
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,199
IN-INCROYABLE!

262
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,879
Imbeciles, look at more attentively.

263
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,009
Isn't a dreamer?

264
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,789
It is right
slap-with-l'oeil.

265
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,000
How that?

266
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,970
It was that a decoration?!

267
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,990
It is a piece of the same island.

268
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,120
This island was Jaya!

269
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,570
Then, a day, this island
separated into two…

270
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,880
and a half is
found in the sky.

271
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,650
But how is this possible?

272
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,440
A band of Birds of the South… But…

273
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Why?

274
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,530
Why they are so large?!

275
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,440
Ca can be only
this gigantic running.

276
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,650
As insane as that can appear.

277
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,530
It is you who saved us?

278
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,710
Hein?! This man is God?!

279
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,630
My name is Montblanc Cricket.

280
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,500
Afflicted for presently.

281
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,620
I thought that you had some
after my gold like these idiots.

282
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,730
You want to say that the island
celestial does not exist?!

283
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,360
I know somebody who
its existence affirmed, but…

284
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,860
It was famous to have been
largest of the liars.

285
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,570
It IS NOT ME!

286
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,980
“Norland, the Liar”

287
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,020
“I saw a gold mountain
on an island of the Large Sea. “

288
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,100
The courageous King, wanting to see that
of its eyes, embarked immediately.

289
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,810
But all that the King and his men
discovered was a simple jungle.

290
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,669
It is represented with one
to smile idiotic on the drawing.

291
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,900
But he died in sadness,
eyes full with tears.

292
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,329
He affirmed that the city had finished at the bottom of
water, following the movement of the tectonic plates.

293
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,990
But for everyone, it was only one
poor dead loss seeking only to justify itself.

294
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,640
It is a duel against
that which ruined my life.

295
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,050
It is for that you plunge each
day until you do fall sick?

296
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,389
My goal is not
to prove its innocence.

297
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,430
I want just to regulate
that, before clamser.

298
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,990
Q-which man!

299
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,519
Let us stop…

300
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Norland.

301
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,699
Give me your hand!

302
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,270
STOP SINGING!

303
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,480
The gold city that Norland
had discovered in bottom…

304
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,830
did not run.

305
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,589
Jaya always was there…

306
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,320
floating in the sky!

1
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Lost ruins!

2
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Vivi, companions,

3
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,950
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,750
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,670
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

6
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,460
After having left Ace, Luffy and its crew…

7
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,590
… continue their crossing of the immense desert which leads to Yuba.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,560
Will they manage to stop the seat of the rebellious army?

9
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,190
To lay down sun at the horizon takes care silently on them…

10
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,870
It would be said that it takes again its spirits.

11
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,590
Hein?

12
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,490
That is there, you are finally awaked.

13
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,330
You are really carefree.

14
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,630
What? Q-what?

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,890
Where did they pass all?

16
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,880
Who knows?

17
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,710
How that “Which knows”?
You do not know anything of it?

18
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,500
To tell the truth, I do not have any idea of it.

19
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,480
What does that want to say?

20
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,480
There are not time to joke!

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,620
I will not contradict you.

22
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,830
Then one is still lost, it is that?

23
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,130
WITH WHICH IT FAULT?!

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,090
Q- What?

25
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,980
It is of my fault?

26
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,240
Wait!!!! Crocodile!

27
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,700
Q- What?

28
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,540
I will explode you the mouth!

29
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,100
What does it have to be excited like that, up there?

30
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,270
Ca makes a few moments that it started to jump in the air…

31
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,510
Perhaps that he still ate some of these strange cacti.

32
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,180
He! I am an elastic man, you know?!

33
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,850
Frankly! I think that it cannot be prevented from howling.

34
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,860
Where you hide you?! Bring back yourself!

35
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,240
Go shows itself!!

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,190
Chopper!

37
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,890
I am not sure that it can do something.

38
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,570
You will not ravel yourself, I will crush you!!

39
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,580
There is not thus an other choice.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,900
Zoro, deals with him.

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,950
And why I would have?!

42
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,410
Do you want that one speaks again of the debt that you have towards me?

43
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,540
If you do not go in hell, I will throw you there!

44
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,600
I would like to see that!

45
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,500
Now, let us carry on our road.

46
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,160
How? Shouldn't we await them?

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,590
All will go well for them, if they follow our prints in sand.

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,930
In any event, with their endurance they will catch up with us.

49
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,220
We will await them a place where we will be able to rest.

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,320
I am of agreement…!

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,960
Will they be left there without concern?

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Species of moron! Calm yourself!

53
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,190
Good blood.

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,520
If ever you on a occasion, it of a blow strikes!

55
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,130
O-Oui, worries you…

56
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,710
I count on you.

57
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,910
Fact of shitting, they always count on me to deal with the dirty job.

58
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,520
CROCODILE!!

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,370
Te here!

60
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,510
Q - What you tell, good blood?!

61
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,120
I will explode you the mouth!

62
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Moron! You will calm yourself or…

63
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,950
Sadowari = Slit of sand

64
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,760
It is each time similar…

65
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,660
It is really hard to stop it once it lost the spirit.

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,140
Good blood…

67
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,140
But what was I to embark with a Captain like him?

68
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,200
What…!

69
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,190
Why am I…?

70
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,420
What you foutez?!

71
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,770
How? What?
Good blood, what arrived to you?

72
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,440
He, Zoro!

73
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,260
Go!

74
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,180
Awake!

75
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,140
Potion which awakes.

76
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,600
Thank you.

77
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,230
What did you make?

78
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,410
Trifles.

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,140
It is always buried.

80
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,920
Leave it like that for the moment.

81
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,650
Where are the different ones?

82
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,840
When I regained consciousness, they had already left…

83
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,190
Sympas, not?

84
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,290
It is not serious, one can catch up with them while following their prints.

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,870
Their prints?

86
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,410
What you said?!

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,960
YOU WERE CROCODILE?!

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,350
Did you listen to what I said, at least?!

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,310
Hein? One is lost?

90
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,380
Species of cretin…

91
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,470
Why you did not follow them earlier?!

92
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,110
I You AI ALREADY KNOWN AS THAT It WAS OF MT FAULT!!

93
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,630
Do Chopper, you have a good sense of smell, not true?

94
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,920
I am testing, but I do not feel anything.

95
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,230
Does shit, it thus have no trace there?

96
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,170
In which direction does blow the wind?

97
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,170
I really do not know in which direction…

98
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,800
… but it blows on my left side.

99
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,340
On the left, hein?

100
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,460
At least it is known that they are not in this direction.

101
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,870
Brilliant deduction…

102
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,770
Close it!

103
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,160
If you do not want to come, then remains here!

104
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,110
Allons-y, Chopper.

105
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,510
Hein? Of agreement.

106
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,600
He, await me!

107
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,970
Do not leave me there!

108
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,240
Whore, it makes hot…

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,910
Is it well?

110
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,170
It is not kind to be given up in front of a situation like that one.

111
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,000
Say to me…

112
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,020
What?

113
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,250
Are the pirates always like that?

114
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,310
What do you want to say?

115
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,910
To climb covered with snow mountains, to cross deserts…

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,180
Yes eh well…

117
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,180
Eh well, I think that one is different from the other pirates.

118
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,890
Since we have it as Capitaine.

119
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,840
I wonder whether I did not embark in the bad boat…

120
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,210
It is funny.

121
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,780
It is exactly what I wondered still little time ago.

122
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,930
Say?

123
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,830
You are more the former member of the crew, not true?

124
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,820
It is not as if there were differences between more the former members and the whole new.

125
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,830
Why do you have joined?

126
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,730
Why you me requests that?

127
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,040
I have just joined the crew,

128
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,430
and everyone appears undisciplined to me and independent.

129
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,860
Especially you, Zoro.

130
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,170
It is true.

131
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,140
In my case, the things were essential themselves.

132
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,200
Or something like that.

133
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,830
The remainder of the crew is also like me.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Our objectives are different as of his.

135
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,200
One tries all to carry out our own objectives.

136
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,680
Good blood.

137
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,660
Once, somebody said…

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,660
… that seen outside, we did not have the air not welded.

139
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,630
Since then, everyone is independent of the Captain.

140
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,930
It is damage.

141
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,520
I think too.

142
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,300
But…

143
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,310
At the end of the day, what wants to really say “welded”?

144
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,690
Is it right to be come to assistance and to protect the ones the others?

145
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,350
There are people who think that.

146
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,690
But for me, it is right childishness.

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,580
Each one should live its life as he hears it and to say to the next guy:

148
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,470
“I did what I could.
Maintaining with you to play. “

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,650
“If you do not finish any,
I will explode you the mouth "

150
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,180
Isn't this the direction first of a team?

151
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,360
When I look at there more closely,

152
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,880
I think that is well to have undisciplined and independent companions.

153
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
Thus I see the things.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Now I include/understand what Usopp wanted to say while saying to me to do better than I could.

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,130
But when he says that, it is more one lie which another thing.

156
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,280
Why are we always his/her companions…?

157
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,790
Since all this time that we are together, another objective started to take shape.

158
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,130
Another objective?

159
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,610
Afflicted, I cannot really say what it is.

160
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,810
SHADE, OVER THERE!

161
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Ca makes good!

162
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,780
I WILL CUT OUT YOU OUT OF DISCS!

163
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,860
Ca goes, I excuse itself.

164
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Hein? Where is Chopper?

165
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,810
Ah, it is there.

166
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,740
Why is it found in such a position?

167
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,210
Does it try to be funny?

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,040
I know, it is my fault.

169
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,090
Afflicted.

170
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,570
It is not believable.

171
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,710
How a serious conversation it could be finished thus…

172
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,960
He, I do not see what I could say of funny.

173
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,100
I AM PUFF OUT A HOLE!!

174
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,870
Are Oh, you well?

175
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,610
Shit…

176
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,560
Ca hurts…

177
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,500
But what is it that this place?

178
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,350
What is it?

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
What is it…?

180
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,170
What a similar thing…

181
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,870
… made under ground?

182
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,710
Good blood, why you are descended?!

183
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,610
I am descended using my hands!

184
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,010
I do not ask you how but why?!

185
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,620
Because that amuses me.

186
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,490
IMBECILE!

187
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,860
If you are descended, one will be separate of Chopper!

188
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,270
Without him, we will not be likely any to find Vivi and the others!

189
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,970
Ah, not of concern.

190
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,810
Why that?

191
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,530
Chopper is also going down.

192
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,970
You see?

193
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,530
Where am I?

194
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,610
Yo, one would say that you are well.

195
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,110
Zoro, Luffy!
Where are we…?

196
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,830
No idea.

197
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,960
All that one knows, it is that one is undoubtedly under ground.

198
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,720
Under ground?

199
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,270
Wow, I am burst.

200
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,600
We rest.

201
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,340
Yes, Nami-San!

202
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,370
Eh well, you show pity.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,760
You say that because you were on the back of Matsuge.

204
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,700
Whereas me, I walked all length!

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,300
Thank you, Matsuge.

206
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,500
Vivi?

207
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,480
I wonder whether Luffy and the others will be able to find us here.

208
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,080
They will arrive there.

209
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,520
These ruins are at the top of a dune, moreover they are visible of rather far.

210
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,400
I hope that you are right.

211
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,640
Say, we are still far from Yuba?

212
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,800
Now that we reached these ruins,

213
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,390
if we continue at this rate/rhythm, should be to us with fallen the night there.

214
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,590
Fortunately, we are there almost.

215
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,760
Are Hein, then they ruins?

216
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,100
Yes, I believe that they go back to one very old time.

217
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,850
Our civilization was born on this ground thousands of years ago.

218
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,710
Several kingdoms were built and disappeared thereafter.

219
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,870
People migrated of places in places in the search of water, which generated wars.

220
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,550
Through this country the vestiges of these periods rest.

221
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,950
Much of them remains still a mystery.

222
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,640
Then it is with the wire of time that the kingdom of Arabasta settled here.

223
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,260
It, isn't this is a beautiful story?

224
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,690
“Even a country reached by the dryness is brought to disappear.”

225
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,970
One would say almost a novel, not?

226
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,920
Sanji-Kun!

227
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,950
Afflicted, Vivi-Chan…

228
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,460
I wanted just to say…

229
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,480
It is right a façon de parler…

230
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,280
Ca goes.

231
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,470
Once again, I think only of me.

232
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,860
What a country?

233
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,410
Even if the leader changes, the people continue to live.

234
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,950
Thus are the habits.

235
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,480
I think that if they remain in place when the kingdom changes,

236
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,650
it could be that there does not need to fight to defend the kingdom.

237
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,780
There are perhaps more important things which really deserve to be protected.

238
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,780
After having visited this city with the false rebellious army and to have met the pirates of Sands,

239
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,800
I started again to think of the kind.

240
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,090
I am sorry to speak about all these strange things.

241
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,940
I still do not have myself answer.

242
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,140
But what I must from now on do is clear.

243
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,510
Because of the secret plans of Works Baroque,
a war which does not have a direction is likely to burst.

244
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,010
I must prevent that arrives, no matter what it costs some.

245
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,390
What they are making will destroy this ground.

246
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,680
Even if the history of this kingdom were so cruel…

247
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,600
I will not leave to the plan Crocodile succeed.

248
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,780
It is decided, allons-y.

249
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,220
Are Usopp-San, you well?

250
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,000
One stopped too a long time.

251
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,550
I cannot retain the force which is in me.

252
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,320
Liar.

253
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,760
CLOSE it! CA WILL NOT LAST!

254
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,540
I will show you the courage of the man called Usopp!

255
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,900
I will not fall on the knees also easily!

256
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,270
But what you insane?!

257
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,840
Then one goes there, Vivi?

258
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,360
Dumb, I will lath you!

259
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,320
Yes, but for Luffy-San?

260
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,320
Yes, yes.

261
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,000
Thus do not worry you so much.

262
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,550
He said that he was going to beat this merdeux of Crocodile.

263
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,880
When it has an idea at the head, it can draw from any situation.

264
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,150
You know it well, not?

265
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,260
Yes.

266
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,740
I can finally better see.

267
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,680
Now that I can see, it would seem that we are in an immense dome.

268
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,150
Built by the human ones.

269
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,680
I think that it is probably an old ruin.

270
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,100
How can you the knowledge?

271
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,200
Look at that.

272
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,520
There is like hiéroglyphes registered on all the wall.

273
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,380
I saw something of similar in a book.

274
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,510
It is an ancient written form.

275
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,190
Who that interests?

276
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,300
Most important, it is that this place is very refreshing!

277
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,050
Ca makes really good!

278
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,150
Let us suppose that you are right,

279
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,910
why is this under ground?

280
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,300
Eh well… I did not can say…

281
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,230
Either the dome was built under ground, or it was buried by sand well later.

282
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,360
In one way or another, it would be said well that somebody sought to hide this building.

283
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,980
Anyone which did that, that represents one crowned work.

284
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,110
I there know nothing the whole and besides I of insane.

285
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,380
The only thing that we have to make from now on, it is to break from here.

286
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,550
Not true, Captain?

287
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,600
Hein? You are sure?
However it is well here.

288
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,110
Cease groaning and rises!

289
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,570
Not, I do not want, I do not want!

290
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,430
I want to remain there still a little more.

291
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,120
You know that it is hot outside.

292
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,550
Of agreement, we magnons and draw us from there.

293
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,450
We must catch up with the others.

294
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,040
There is this hole that Zoro made when it fell folded from laughing.

295
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,150
CLOSE it!

296
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Well!

297
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,450
What you insane?

298
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,470
Shit, I missed because the hole is too small.

299
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,750
That is there, I am there…!

300
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,180
Brothel what you insane?!

301
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,010
I try to clutch me with the rock close to the hole!

302
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,390
Fact of shitting, now I am irritated!

303
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,220
Well, I feel better!

304
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,620
DECREE TO BE ALSO UNCONSCIOUS!!

305
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,930
Now that you destroyed the rock, to what we will clutch ourselves?!

306
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,160
Ca goes.

307
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,200
I have a plan.

308
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,070
Chopper, you would make better take again your small size.

309
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,940
Oh, then it is that its plan.

310
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,560
You hang!

311
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,620
Drop, it is the only solution.

312
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,420
It left!!!!

313
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,250
Zenmai = Jump

314
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,560
How will one make to land?

315
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,630
How if I knew it!

316
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,350
You cannot be serious!

317
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,790
I said to you to drop, not?!

318
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,410
PAS COMME ÇA!!

319
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,030
Beautiful rescue!

320
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,520
Where did they pass?

321
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
Ah! Over there!

322
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,890
After reflection, I think that I embarked in the bad boat…

323
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,480
One is on same the longueur d'onde today.

324
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,520
I say myself the same thing exactly.

325
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Usopp, you will end up being lagging behind.

326
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,710
Weren't you to show us that you were a courageous man?

327
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,260
I announced right what I felt…

328
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,460
Hold good.

329
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,900
One is almost at the end of the voyage.

330
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,510
Es you always anxious?

331
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,750
Oh, not I…

332
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,470
One can read it on your face.

333
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,670
Afflicted. I rely on them, but…

334
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,160
It would be said that you will be anxious throughout your life.

335
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,720
Eh well, from time to time that can be a good character trait.

336
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,280
You all are incredible.

337
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,350
Hein?

338
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,670
Since Little Garden, I wondered…

339
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,590
How it was possible for you to rely as much on your companions?

340
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,580
“How”…?

341
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,790
Eh well, I never really tried to trust them.

342
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,500
In fact, I even never really thought before.

343
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,070
It is that which is incredible.

344
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,020
There are few people who trust others without the shade of a doubt.

345
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,830
Eh well, I am not sure, but…

346
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,740
Perhaps that it is because each one among us does best than it can with its capacities.

347
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,280
He said a thing on the island from where I come…

348
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,380
It is obvious that I know nothing as regards sabers there, morons!

349
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,720
I donot can sail either!

350
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,090
I donot can cook!

351
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,860
I donot can even lie!

352
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,650
He.

353
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,820
I know pertinently that I need the others to be able to live!

354
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,750
I remember these words well.

355
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,150
I had this impression:
“Then thus the crew of this pirate is.”

356
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,150
You know, a person cannot make some too much.

357
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,150
No matter what you want to make, it is impossible to only carry it out.

358
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,360
You need to have companions.

359
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,770
But if they do not do all what is in their capacity for you, that does not have any direction, not?

360
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,210
Was Oh, it a strange answer?

361
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Not…

362
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,680
Thank you.

363
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,850
The weather is so hot that I do not know even any more what I say!

364
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,750
In fact… it is an excellent answer.

365
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,540
It is true.

366
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,150
It could be that it is the design of a new country.

367
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,690
, Dispatch you go!

368
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,060
Now that it was refreshed,
it is full with energy and wants to hurry.

369
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,950
Hein? What is there?

370
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,340
The wind changed direction.

371
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,910
I felt something!

372
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,770
What?

373
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,770
I am sure.
It is the perfume of Nami!

374
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,050
They are in this direction.

375
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:06,980
Played well!

376
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,780
Luffy!

377
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,610
One found Nami and the others!

378
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,240
Straight towards the sunset!

379
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,400
Really?

380
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,680
He! The guy!

381
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,600
Do not leave all alone!

382
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,170
You still will lose yourself, species of moron!!

383
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,940
I saw things so much while we travel together…

384
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,670
Perhaps that they will bring the answer.

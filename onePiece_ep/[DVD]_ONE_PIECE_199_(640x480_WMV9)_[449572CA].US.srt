1
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,880
On their return of the sky, the crew of Straw hat attérit in full heart of the fortress marinades Navarone.

2
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,820
Zoro was done captured.

3
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,390
As for Luffy and the others, they infiltrated in the base.

4
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,250
However they are about to have to face a great danger.

5
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,430
The captured second nobody!

6
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,430
Naval operation!

7
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,490
The base n°8 of the marine.

8
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,860
It is called also Navarone.

9
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,490
It with the reputation to be the fortress best kept navy.

10
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,360
It may be even that the general headquarter is in the central tower.

11
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,910
But I do not know any more.

12
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,570
That does not change anything the whole to the problem.

13
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,500
Archeology, the fortresses of the navy, be really impressive for you, Robin.

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,440
You are irritated?

15
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,970
We were taken by storm.

16
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,880
Reason moreover not to remain here indefinitely to observe the situation.

17
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,970
I want right to know if Going Merry is intact.

18
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,070
Where are you, Merry?

19
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,430
It could be that the navy hid it.

20
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,680
And then…

21
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,030
It is not a reason to react also calmly!

22
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,220
Even if you find the boat,
what do you hope to make?

23
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,950
You believe that the members of the navy will say:

24
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,330
“Go ahead leave, I request from you”,
while showing you the way?

25
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,570
It is true…

26
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,110
This is why, I think that it is preferable that one acts gradually,

27
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,900
not?

28
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,240
How could one continue to regard himself as pirates if they are feared?

29
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,760
In the worst case, I make them my excuse.

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,210
Will have you that with jetter an eye into soft on your side.

31
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,990
IEA!

32
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,960
Robin!

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,610
Good blood but what you…

34
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,860
You saw somebody?!

35
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,720
Not, not yet!

36
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,010
The crew of Straw hat surely owes terrer very close to here.

37
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,370
We must capture them dead or sharp!

38
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,040
Yes!

39
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,930
Nobody can flee from here.

40
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,840
One even succeeded in capturing Roronoa Zoro.

41
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,370
Z-Zoro was…

42
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,030
You are well? Length-conk.

43
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,570
You ace heard what it has just said?

44
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,590
I imagine that they envisaged something while making pass the boat of Straw hat for a ghost ship.

45
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,040
They must seek us everywhere.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,260
You would make better worry you about your fate rather than of that of the boat.

47
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,980
D-D' practice I would have acted like that…

48
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,760
but there I do not have an excuse.

49
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,670
The boat is more important than my life.

50
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,980
It is decided I will find the boat.

51
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,330
It is not the sorrow of me in empécher,

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,050
I go there.

53
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,650
Which desperate case…

54
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,910
I carried out all this way
since the base after the storm.

55
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,460
And there is nobody to accommodate me.

56
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,580
Standard He, you it over there!

57
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,410
Yes!

58
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,470
I came to meet the Commander of this base.

59
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,210
Will prevent it that I want to see it immediately!

60
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,980
Yes! Mister the Commander!

61
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,550
Could you first of all decline the reason of your arrival within the fortress?

62
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,930
Since when a subordinate as must it be to you with the being held informed of that…?!

63
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,350
I am sorry.

64
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,650
Could you indicate to me the name of your squadron and your title?

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,910
It is necessary that you know it?!

66
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,180
Will warn your Commander immediately!

67
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,850
I am afraid well not to be able to reach your request.

68
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,450
What do you insinuate by there?

69
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,870
The Commander Jonasan is lunching per hour that it is.

70
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,740
He must surely be in the refectory.

71
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,190
Eh well, goes to the refectory!

72
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,070
Euh…

73
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,540
Aren't you informed of the rules of the base n°8?

74
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,260
Rules?

75
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,800
First of all,

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
to wash the hands before eating!

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,880
Secondly, never not to eat the remainders!

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,550
Thirdly, never not to speak work with table.

79
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,840
Fourthly, not to forget to wash the teeth after-to eat…

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,230
That is enough!

81
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,980
Does your Commander, regard as more important the fact of eating rather than to reach my request?

82
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,280
Then?

83
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,850
Yes.

84
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,040
Completely.

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,330
Well, I see.

86
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,430
I will see the Commander in person.

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,530
I also will give you a warning.

88
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,830
You would make well think of the place where you risks to be transferred now.

89
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,660
I have the impression that these beginners are confined to carry out of the useless tasks.

90
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,820
And old fossil, which is a famous Commander…

91
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,340
no beneficial contribution for the navy has.

92
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,630
I would make share at the general headquarter of it early or late.

93
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,580
This foutu pig.

94
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,520
It will occupy yet this position only for a few weeks at best.

95
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,460
Benefit well from food from
Navarone during the days that it remains you.

96
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,040
A hallucination.

97
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,840
An inspector of the general headquarter of the marine.

98
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,430
Well, I fell on the good pigeon.

99
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,330
Ah, that they is delicious.

100
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,010
Was that cooked by the famous cook?

101
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,340
That has the same taste as what the others ate this morning.

102
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,970
The guy,

103
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,530
there are 100 people of the next group who wait.

104
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,990
Dispatch you to finish eating!

105
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,410
IMMEDIATELY, CHIEF!

106
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,050
Forgiveness for waiting.

107
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,160
Oh, Jessica.

108
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,610
It is not the kind of dish which you usually make?

109
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,600
What want you to say,

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,520
Mister the Commander?

111
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,670
It is that,

112
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,470
it was reported to me that the food prepared by the cooks of Maryjor was marvellous.

113
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,830
Then I was very excited to come to lunch with the refectory. But instead of that I…

114
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,570
You do not like?

115
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,770
As a Chief, I cannot
to always cook the dishes…

116
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,110
that you want to eat.

117
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,400
Here a healthy and tasty menu.

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,010
Go, profit.

119
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,300
But there are only vegetables.

120
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,620
I do not like broccolis and carrots.

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,150
Which is the second rule of the base n°8?

122
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,530
I included/understood.

123
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,740
Look at, I eat.

124
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,530
They is too good.

125
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,410
Too much good. They is too delicious.

126
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,500
You made super job.

127
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,040
What does not go with the newcomer?

128
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,200
He does not stop eating since the beginning.

129
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,480
You do not trouble about him.

130
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,880
It is a specialist.

131
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,940
I do not think that it is made to be a chief in a base of the marine.

132
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,960
It is impressing the difference which there is between you two.

133
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,710
Everyone is admiring in front of you.

134
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,510
Thank you very much.

135
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,580
Well, I will reveal you later my secrecy.

136
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,350
Could you hurry to finish the dish for the table n°8!

137
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,890
Yes…

138
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,940
YES, CHIEF!

139
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,440
As long as it is for a pretty woman…

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,730
I will do all that is in my capacity.

141
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,610
Impressing!

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,660
That with the too good air.

143
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,800
It is included/understood, I will serve them.

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,420
Wait.

145
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,990
It is enough to see the dribble on your mouth to know that you will try all to eat in secrecy.

146
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,990
Included/understood?

147
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,980
YES, CHIEF!

148
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,390
Did it really include/understand?

149
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,700
The type of the eighth table…

150
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,890
really much chance has.

151
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,990
Do not prevent it pays great attention to its wife.

152
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,640
Is Jessica-san, it your husband?

153
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,050
You will continue with jacasser still a long time?
Turn over to your furnaces!

154
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,410
Who is this luckiest type of Navarone?

155
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,980
It is the Commander of the base n°8.

156
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,890
It is really the Commander?

157
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,960
Good blood, Luffy.

158
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,570
Here.

159
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,680
Yes, it is well.

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,950
You can lay out.

161
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,030
Yes, yes Mister.

162
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,090
They is as good as what one said some.

163
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,320
Delicious.

164
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,920
You do not want to let me eat in peace.

165
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,870
It is exact.

166
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,870
Let take some to me, crevard a little!

167
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,130
I included/understood why you remained there.

168
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,730
Shit, it is too late.

169
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,410
Welcome, Luffy with the Straw hat.

170
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,770
I am the Commander of the base G8 Navarone.

171
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,610
Jonasan.

172
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,860
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

173
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,450
GOMU-GOMU-NO-FANSUB

174
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Straw hat.

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,610
I do not wish to beat me in the refectory.

176
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,970
But could I ask you a question?

177
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,350
If I answer, you will be able to let to me eat half of it?

178
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,470
And well I will give you even all.

179
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,930
I am sorry to have you to treat crevard with the moment.

180
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,920
Imbecile, hurries to flee.

181
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,860
I did not seize the reason of your arrival here.

182
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,090
I know that…

183
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,560
it is well colonel Smoker who had demolishes Crocodile.

184
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,720
But you had gone to Alabasta

185
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,950
neither for the money nor for glory.

186
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,370
What do you really want in this fortress?

187
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,840
What did you come to make here?

188
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,870
But about what do you speak?

189
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,860
One fell here from the sky.

190
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,070
It is too flippant Grand Line.

191
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,470
I appreciate much the fortresses.

192
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,720
As food is good I am too content.

193
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,500
Listen to Straw hat.

194
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,390
Even for a holder of a fruit of the demon…

195
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,350
it is impossible to escape from the Navarone fortress.

196
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,190
Impossible.

197
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,890
I could escape to me from here if I want it.

198
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,290
Even knowing that one arrété Roronoa Zoro.

199
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,490
Zoro.

200
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,910
The dumb.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,290
Uncle Fortress,

202
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,360
where is Zoro?

203
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,700
Why such a question?

204
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,020
You ace not included/understood?

205
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,960
And well,

206
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,580
it is to go to release it immediately!

207
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,560
Pas la pains to excite you.

208
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,960
I soon will take you along

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,050
to join.

210
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,140
Useless to remain here longer, one goes there!

211
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,180
Jessica-san…

212
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,400
Then you really belong to
the crew of Straw hat.

213
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,020
It's a pity that a talent as the tien serf the cause of the pirates.

214
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,200
Useless to flee.

215
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,070
In Navarone, the cooks can fight like soldiers.

216
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,380
I can also work in this manner, I know this kind of kitchen.

217
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,030
Is necessary that I find a solution,

218
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,990
I cannot attack Jessica-san.

219
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,660
What I must make…

220
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,340
I am too hungry!

221
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,060
Ah, the hour of the meal, the hour of the meal!

222
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,490
Y' has an excellent food since the arrival of the new cook.

223
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,060
Prepare to eat!

224
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,560
Wait, one has still something to make!

225
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,390
One breaks!

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,390
Straw hat!

227
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,210
Uncle Fortress!

228
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,660
With the next one!

229
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,990
Our enemies make parties of
the crew of Straw hat!

230
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,370
We must remain in alarm constantly!

231
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,960
In the name of the Navarone base,

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,930
we must stop them!

233
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes!

234
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,180
The soldiers of the navy are ready to risk their life.

235
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,580
They is dangerous to remain so close to them.

236
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,900
I would make well change my appearance.

237
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,640
Perfect!

238
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,010
Successful transformation.

239
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,750
I will pass unperceived…

240
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,160
Wait!

241
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,480
A soldier of Navarone must act like the other soldiers of Navarone.

242
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,380
Readjust your clothing.

243
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,960
Yes.

244
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,740
The small new ones are often rebels.

245
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,090
Yes,

246
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,240
I will in the future pay more attention.

247
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,070
Ah… in fact… I would like to ask you…

248
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,550
in connection with would the boat of the crew of Straw hat… you know where it is?

249
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,020
Borrow the 6th staircase while following this road.

250
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:35,330
Yes!

251
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,440
Thank you infinitely!

252
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,000
I will see that.

253
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,310
He, it is the shipyard…

254
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,580
I will find well all alone!

255
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,300
Me-Merry!

256
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,290
Thank you.

257
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,950
God thank you, you do not have anything.

258
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,450
I repaired it.

259
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,880
A light sailing ship with a bar of weak tonnage and a robust rope.

260
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,220
In spite of its a little retro style, it is a good boat.

261
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,640
Who are you?

262
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,770
I did not know that you were a new recruit.

263
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,820
It is exact.

264
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,570
This boat surely failed here of force.

265
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,660
Though it underwent several
repairs but it is good job.

266
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,060
Its owner likes it much, this boat has chance of it.

267
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,650
How do you know all that?

268
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,110
That it is a ship of the navy or a ship of pirate, it is the same thing for me.

269
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,650
I manage to guess all that with the first glance.

270
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,950
I am charmed to intend it to you to say!

271
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,060
Cretin, it is not with you that I launch flowers!

272
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,520
It is not serious, I appreciate you enormously nevertheless.

273
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,330
Be to you that new, avoids having cheeck.

274
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,350
You still made not the difference between a ship of the navy and a pirate boat.

275
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,010
Major Drake.

276
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,970
You must still have patience a week to know the evolution of repairs.

277
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:39,480
Lately, the members of the navy seem to embark on defective ships at the time of their missions.

278
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,980
With the result that the engineers are very occupied.

279
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,040
There is no concern.

280
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,840
I did not come for that, old mechanic.
I am there for this type…

281
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,290
He you!

282
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,110
Yes!

283
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,640
Be to you of which unit?

284
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,950
Euuuh…

285
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,800
You do not know your unit?

286
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,580
Euh… I believe well that it is eighteenth…

287
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,540
Eighteenth it is that of the tireurs d'élite.

288
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,340
Among the rules of the units

289
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,290
it is formally interdict to go to the shipyard.

290
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,920
Euh…

291
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,410
afflicted, I had forgotten.

292
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,380
I go immediately within my unit.

293
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,880
It is not worthwhile!

294
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,140
Pas la pains?!

295
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,470
Embark it.

296
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,680
Qu-Qu'est-ce-que I made?!

297
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,140
Stated that one put the hand on one
new soldier of the quite equivocal navy.

298
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,260
Moreover, the eighteenth unit is not that of the tireurs d'élite, it is the unit of reserve.

299
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,300
Really?

300
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,960
Yes, yes, it is that the unit of reserve.

301
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,970
Stop, band of imbeciles!

302
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,360
Where do you believe yourselves?

303
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,140
It is a place crowned here for me!

304
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,280
I will not authorize you to make run, would be this only one drops of blood!

305
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,140
Arrange your sabers.

306
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,520
Take it along in the Commander.

307
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,380
Yes.

308
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,670
Hmm, this man.

309
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,880
Commander,

310
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,340
he claims to make party of the marine.

311
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,830
But obviously with what occurred,

312
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,990
it is clear that it belongs to
the crew of Straw hat.

313
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:01,760
Say to me…

314
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,510
your name.

315
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,040
Your name.

316
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,370
A secrecy.

317
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,490
From which do you come?

318
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,710
A secrecy.

319
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,810
Why you went exactly there or the ship of the pirates was.

320
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:14,990
A secrecy.

321
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,530
A secrecy?

322
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,370
Yes.

323
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,160
Let us put it in prison.

324
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,120
Let us torture it.

325
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,560
Not, wait, Major.

326
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,950
I intended to say that a special inspector of the navy arrived at the same time as Stanberry this morning.

327
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,770
A special inspector?

328
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,810
Co… Commander…

329
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,040
The inspector acts secretly and in total anonymity.

330
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,260
And undoubtedly he will not say to us from where he comes.

331
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,210
C-how…?

332
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:40,830
It is impossible.

333
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,760
This type?!

334
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,600
You saw just.

335
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,720
As you suspected it, Commander…

336
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,360
I am the special inspector of the general headquarter of the marine.

337
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,820
Usopp captain!

338
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,110
Is there something to announce to the level of the base n°8?

339
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,570
You have proudly
to protect the honor from the navy?

340
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,490
And its ethics?

341
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,000
Here thus the reason why…

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
I disguised myself as a private.

343
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Forgive us, Capitaine!

344
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,410
How this is possible…

345
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,780
what he is the special inspector of the marine?

346
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,800
It is a row higher than that of basic Commander.

347
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,840
Do you say the truth?

348
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,090
You?

349
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,670
You?!

350
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,700
You are only one simple Major.
How oses you to speak to me about the kind?

351
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,330
How?

352
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,770
You will be sent in front of the cour martiale for insult towards your superior.

353
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,080
But…

354
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,730
Will have you surely the right to eat
the food of the prisoners of the marine.

355
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,840
Forgive me, Capitaine.

356
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,260
I wanted to precisely accommodate you on your arrival, but I was late.

357
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,490
Please excuse me.

358
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,980
It is not serious, it is not serious!
As long as you excused yourselves.

359
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,880
Commander!

360
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,620
The special inspector of the navy has just arrived!

361
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,730
Lieutenant Shepsherd is there!

362
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,450
The true inspector is there?

363
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,190
I knew it!

364
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,390
Dumb! You ace played well the comedy.

365
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,000
Forgiveness, forgiveness.

366
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,550
Where passed your arrogance, hein?!

367
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Forgiveness.

368
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,890
To dare to say that suited you to make me eat the food of the prisoners of the marine!

369
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,970
Forgiveness, forgiveness.

370
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,470
Forgiveness, forgiveness, I am really sorry.

371
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,120
You have us Bern so much so that you were dedicated respect.

372
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,710
Do not believe to draw you with excuses.

373
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,730
Forgiveness.

374
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,480
Only by seeing you I knew that were to you a usurper.

375
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,600
Charmed you to meet, Commander Jonasan.

376
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,660
Be ready for you to undergo the hell? Dumb.

377
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,180
Robin?

378
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,180
One will not forgive you!

379
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,550
Hein? Then? Hein?

380
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,380
Hein, where your arrogance passed?!

381
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,390
I see, Robin disguised myself.

382
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,440
Biiien!

383
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,440
I guaranteed to you that you you will not leave there like that!

384
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,650
Ah it is you Lieutenant.

385
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,590
You are you also come in Navarone.

386
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,870
Ah, it is me, it is me!

387
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,240
The Usopp captain of same
department of inspection that yours.

388
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
Perhaps you do not recognize me because of my ridiculous disguise?

389
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,460
Lieutenant Shepherd.

390
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,110
Do you know the captain?

391
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,270
I never saw it before.

392
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,500
You see!!!

393
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,160
It is me! It is me! He! He!

394
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,160
Imprison it!

395
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,770
I from there will inspect myself Navarone now.

396
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,240
Please make as on your premise, Lieutenant Shepherd.

397
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,190
Thank you infinitely.

398
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,860
The bitch…

399
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,170
If is not to betray his/her comrades that?!

400
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,080
You think the same thing, Zoro?!

401
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Shit!

402
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,350
If Robin had agreed to follow my plan…

403
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,960
I would have to surely recover Merry.

404
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,660
You should thank Robin.

405
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,930
What do you tell?

406
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:09,750
Why you protect it?

407
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,210
I am here also, not?

408
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,960
I included/understood. And then all will be well with Zoro to my sides.

409
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,330
But then Robin thought of me.

410
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,100
But…

411
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,660
let us be us in safety here.

412
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,330
I should not inspect too much by here.

413
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,930
Where is the exit?

414
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,530
There is of them obligatorily one.

415
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,460
Zoro!!!

416
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,380
Zoro, be to you where?! Zoro!!

417
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,380
Close it!

418
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,820
Why you do as much din?!

419
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,480
Come, by here!

420
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,330
One also has just captured a type with a length-conk, after the arrest of Zoro.

421
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,190
The remainder of the crew of Straw hat must be in the parrages.

422
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,310
Find them!

423
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,130
Yes!

424
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,470
What will one make, Capitaine?

425
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,690
Straw hat and the talented cook.

426
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,790
The epeist and the length-conk.

427
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,680
The doctor and the unknown nurse.

428
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,500
And… the last…

429
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,580
is saying Lieutenant Shepherd.

430
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,370
They are Sept.

431
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,240
I am certain.

432
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,250
The ship and two men were captured.

433
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,090
The remainder of the crew of Straw hat is under my control.

434
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,000
What do you hope to make Monkey D. Luffy?

435
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,750
Show your force to me.

436
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,710
Luffy come to help us!

437
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,670
Luffy does not move!

438
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,470
Finally if come!

439
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,950
Does Zoro, what one make?

440
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,220
I do not know, say to him to come if that sings to him.

441
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,100
But not…

442
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,530
Await the guy, I come you aideeerrrr…

443
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,210
What you ace?

444
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,400
Ah I see, of Kairouseki!

445
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,040
Zut, it is a trap!

446
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,570
Soon in One Part:

447
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,210
The desperate decision of Luffy and Sanji!

448
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,630
The army maneuvers of rescue!

449
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,540
I will become the lord of the pirates!

450
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,150
The army maneuvers of rescue!

451
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,150
The desperate decision of Luffy and Sanji!

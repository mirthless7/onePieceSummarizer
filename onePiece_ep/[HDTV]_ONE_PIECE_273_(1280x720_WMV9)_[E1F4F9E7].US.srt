1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,270
One Piece Treasure Present!

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,300
The first keyword is... this!

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,500
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,700
Oi!

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,900
It's a dead end ahead!

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,860
We'll crash into it and die!

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,420
Gomorrah, stop!

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,790
Don't rush in recklessly!

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,020
Stop!

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,560
A dead end?

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,220
Do you see such a thing?

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,310
No.

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,960
I can't spot one anywhere...

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,530
Message to all personnel!

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,220
The Kingbull ridden by the pirates has passed through the D-block,

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,780
and has now arrived at the Courthouse Plaza!

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,660
I repeat!

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,860
The pirates are...!

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,630
To all personnel on Enies Lobby's Main Island!

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,700
All hands! Get to the Courthouse Plaza at once!

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
The pirates have arrived at the Courthouse Plaza!!

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,480
And then, the gatekeepers of the Main Island's Front Gate,

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,880
Oimo and Kaashii have joined with the pirates!

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,890
At the moment, they're destroying the middle part of the Main Island!

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,360
Open the way!

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,190
The damage report for our soldiers here is exceeding...

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,130
Two thousand men!

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,910
Meanwhile, their captain, Straw Hat Luffy, who took down a thousand of them by himself,

29
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,820
has suddenly disappeared!

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,380
We are currently searching for him!

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,200
This is probably...

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,520
since Enies Lobby's history began,

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,660
the first time a situation as bad as this has occurred!

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,280
What's happening?

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,240
Now, on this island...

36
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,700
WHAT IS HAPPENING!?

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,700
You!

38
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,810
He jumped!

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,790
That's no good!

40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,910
If I stay like this...

41
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,050
It's no good.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,890
When I lost to Ao Kiji,

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,100
I thought about it.

44
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,690
If strong guys like this are going to appear once again on our road,

45
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,140
if I don't get stronger...

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,540
I won't be able to protect my nakama.

47
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,870
That's because even if they aren't strong

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,760
I have nakama that I want to keep with me.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,820
If I don't get stronger than everyone else,

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,370
I'll lose them all!

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,760
Then what will you do?

52
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,570
I thought about a way to fight at my fullest.

53
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,980
So that I don't lose anyone...

54
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,950
So that I don't let anyone drift away...

55
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,400
What is he doing?

56
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,000
What's happening inside of his body?

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,230
You won't be able...

58
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,590
to keep up with me anymore.

59
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,670
What?

60
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,190
All of my techniques

61
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,680
are going to evolve by one step!

62
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:04,000
All for the Sake of Protecting My Friends! 
Gear Second in Motion

63
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,200
Baskerville!

64
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Judge Baskerville!

65
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,480
Answer, it's me!

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,100
Oh, Chief Spandam!

67
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,810
This is Left-Baskerville on the left!

68
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,940
This is Right-Baskerville on the right!

69
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,510
As for me in the middle,

70
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,850
I am Solitary Journey at Central Main Line!

71
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,220
Who's that?

72
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,090
Tell me the situation over there!

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,940
I heard that the pirates arrived at the Courthouse Plaza!

74
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,310
The situation?

75
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,010
Yeah, the situation!

76
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,500
The situation is...

77
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,160
In fact, they aren't at the plaza anymore, but inside!

78
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,620
That's a disaster!

79
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,350
What did you say!?

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,580
Ju... Judge, I have a report to make!

81
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,580
The huge stone doors of the Courthouse have been cut open...

82
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,770
and pirates have invaded!

83
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,440
I can see that for myself, idiot!

84
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,980
There isn't too much of a crowd here.

85
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,310
Looks like we can go ahead immediately, but...

86
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,710
What's that thing?

87
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,460
Ah!? What is that? Those heads!?

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,180
He's like that three-headed watch-dog I heard about in a story!

89
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,280
He's Cerlickus!

90
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,680
It's Cerberus!

91
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,900
How noisy, be silent!

92
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,360
This is the place of sacred judgement!

93
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,640
I will now decide upon what verdict will rule your fates!

94
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,480
Alright, guys.

95
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,020
For now, try to get to the roof where Straw Hat-san is.

96
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,280
Yokozuna and some others will prevent reinforcements from breaking in from the door.

97
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,970
We'll watch your backs,

98
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,120
so just rush forward for now!

99
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,850
Got it.

100
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,340
Look at that.

101
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,040
It looks like a trial has begun.

102
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,170
Ignore it, it's too much of a pain.

103
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,230
Which way is it?

104
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,380
Straight ahead!

105
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,040
There is a staircase on either side.

106
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,330
We can go upstairs with those!

107
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,310
Alright!

108
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,800
How impolite!

109
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,750
They ignored the sacred judgement!

110
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,890
We won't forgive him!

111
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,030
To ridicule the Judiciary Island!

112
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,600
Shit...

113
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
Eat this!

114
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,300
What?

115
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,940
His katana look like they're bending!

116
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,690
Was he the one who cut the gate earlier?

117
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,510
Alright, let's go.

118
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,750
The path is cleared!

119
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,980
So why isn't he the captain with such strength?

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,940
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

121
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,430
Out of my way, reindeer and idiot swordsman!

122
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,690
Suit niichan.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,360
In this dangerous enemy territory,

124
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,630
I'll be the one who clears Nami-san's path!

125
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,510
Get outta the way!

126
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,170
That's dangerous!

127
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,820
Why are you starting a fight!?

128
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,990
YOU WANNA FIGHT!?

129
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,190
Shut up!

130
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,860
Don't you dare show up on Nami-san's road shamelessly!

131
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,150
Nami-san, this way.

132
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,700
Follow me and only me!

133
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,830
You know, we came here to save Robin...

134
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,930
That's right, Robin-chan is...

135
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,080
She's waiting for me to save her!

136
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,700
I hope she isn't lonely and crying at the moment!

137
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,850
Geez!

138
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,920
Zoro ran off while we weren't watching him!

139
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,360
Wait, Zoro! That's not the right direction!

140
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,480
What?

141
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,150
I said the staircase!

142
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,060
How can you get mistaken and go that way!?

143
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Are you a fantasista!?

144
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,330
Shut up!

145
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,190
Your indications were too messed up!

146
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,700
There's no way I'm the one at fault!

147
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,410
Zoro, next time I'll try to make a medicine!

148
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,130
A medicine for hopeless idiots.

149
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,450
Hopeless idiots? Oi...

150
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,420
Chopper...

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,200
Robin-chwan! I'm coming now!

152
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,540
Be sure it works for this one too.

153
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,840
Okay, understood.

154
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,020
I wonder if aniki will be rescued...

155
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,310
They're a "can rely on them when the time comes" type...

156
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,080
Maybe... Certainly... Probably...

157
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,260
This is a great crime!

158
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,140
This is a great sin!

159
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,730
Then I'll take position between you two and...

160
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,100
Sentence them to death!

161
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,990
Agreed!

162
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,900
Are you alright, Zoro?

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,880
It's this way!

164
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,860
I know!

165
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
Don't ignore the Judge!

166
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,350
Chopper, Nami, you go ahead.

167
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,590
I'll follow after you once I take care of this guy.

168
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,490
You think you'll win against me?

169
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,510
You cocky pirate!

170
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,210
I'll show you what kind of terror I can indulge...

171
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,390
Pull!

172
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,860
St... Stop!!

173
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,190
Oh hisse!

174
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,840
Oh hisse!

175
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,760
Oh hisse!

176
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,670
Oh hisse!

177
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,200
Oh hisse!

178
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
S... St... Stop...

179
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,080
We'll be your opponents, Cerberus!

180
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,520
Franky Family!

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,830
How dare you!?

182
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:41,730
Let's go!

183
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,280
Gear?

184
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,380
Your techniques will evolve?

185
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,560
Blowing steam from all over your body...

186
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,240
Is this your imitation of a steam engine?

187
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,480
What kind of bluff is this?

188
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,800
I am...

189
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,270
I'm glad I met all of you here.

190
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,860
Thanks to you, I'll be able to move forward without losing my nakama.

191
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm glad I met all of you here.

192
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,980
Thanks to you, I'll be able to move forward without losing my nakama.

193
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,890
What are you saying?

194
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,420
I don't get it.

195
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,790
Isn't it because you met us that you're about to lose your nakama?

196
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,160
What you're saying keeps getting weirder and weirder.

197
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,100
Have you gone nuts or something?

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,940
You want to shoot me?

199
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,590
You're only giving me a chance to dodge your attack.

200
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,440
Aim well and try to hit me.

201
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,340
I can't see him at all!

202
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,850
And!

203
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,030
No way!

204
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,830
No, there's no mistake.

205
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,730
I'm glad I met all of you here.

206
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,840
This man really...

207
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,270
He assimilated one of the Rokushiki techniques, soru, and is now using it!

208
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,000
He disappeared.

209
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,480
There can't be such a ridiculous thing.

210
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,980
A pirate scum who's able to fight using soru?

211
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,340
No... Not only did he use soru,

212
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,900
but he enhanced his body to the point that it can withstand the technique.

213
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,080
Did he have such a dormant ability from the start?

214
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,460
This is a joke of bad taste.

215
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,080
However!

216
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,430
There is no way someone can catch up with a Rokushiki user's speed!

217
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,040
There is no way I can lose!

218
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,060
If I turn his body into a door

219
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,770
and seal his movements, he won't have any chance.

220
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,620
I will charge with all of my might and settle this fight.

221
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,860
When you guys move as if you disappeared,

222
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,940
I saw you kicking the ground over ten times in an instant.

223
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,250
I understood the trick,

224
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,230
and I'm glad to know there's a technique to move like this.

225
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,010
I'm glad I met you here.

226
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,000
Thanks to this, I'll be able to protect my nakama for a long time.

227
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,210
I'll take it.

228
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,090
With my strongest tekkai!

229
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,000
You're really one sturdy guy...

230
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,080
Then I'll show you something even more interesting.

231
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,450
Look at this!

232
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,310
I'm so exhausted...

233
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,870
Just as I thought, my body can't keep up with this yet.

234
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,140
Maa, I don't care about my body for now.

235
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,740
I've faced a lot of hindrances...

236
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,290
Damn it!

237
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,380
What's happening?

238
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,420
The cannons!

239
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,460
Fire the cannons!

240
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,150
Otherwise we'll be crushed!

241
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,660
That's useless!

242
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,450
As if we'd stop there, tiny soldiers!

243
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,200
Oimo!

244
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,490
You can't stop us!

245
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,410
I really can't believe it!

246
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,010
Those troublesome gatekeepers are now our allies!

247
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,510
That's what is called a warrior's luck!

248
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,530
Saa, brothers!

249
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,880
The Courthouse is right there!

250
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,680
Charge in!

251
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,220
What are you doing!?

252
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,670
Hurry inside!

253
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,770
Aren't the pirates already in the Courthouse!?

254
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,300
A frog is standing at the central door, so we can't enter!

255
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,490
<i>A frog !?</i>

256
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,930
Don't let even one of them inside!

257
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,760
Yokozuna, hang in there!

258
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,720
If we fail here, thousands of them will flow inside!

259
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,800
Withstand it until the drawbridge is lowered!

260
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,380
We only need one of us to reach our destination!

261
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,630
Whatever happens,

262
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,590
we must pull the drawbridge lever on the upper level!

263
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,660
Mozu sis!

264
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,600
Don't mind me and go!

265
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,270
Lower the bridge and make sure the Straw Hats
 cross over to the Judiciary Tower!

266
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,640
Don't fall!

267
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,270
Absolutely do not let them in!

268
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,960
Don't get in my way!

269
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,940
Why in the world did that swordsman and
 the others go upstairs just now!?

270
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,760
I don't have the obligation to answer that!

271
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,200
What!?

272
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,900
More importantly, Franky aniki better be safe!

273
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,280
Attack!

274
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,460
Seize the pirates!

275
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,690
Those shitty bastards!

276
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,770
There are still so many of them inside!

277
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,730
They're here! Take aim!

278
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,640
Get lost!

279
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,010
Hey there!

280
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,680
Don't send them this way, Chopper!

281
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,220
Guilty!

282
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:50,860
Guilty!

283
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,520
Guilty!

284
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,060
Guilty!

285
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,500
Guilty!

286
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,300
Guilty!

287
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,040
Guilty!

288
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,890
What the hell is wrong with you?

289
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,370
And where is this place!?

290
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,100
You want to send Franky and Nico Robin to the Gates of Justice already?

291
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,970
That's right!

292
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,420
Do as I say!

293
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm sorry, but the ship convoy leaving from the Gates of Justice isn't ready yet!

294
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,760
It's alright!

295
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,440
We can wait for it as long as we want on the other side of the gate!

296
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,920
Anyway!

297
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,700
Anyway, the first thing to do is to steal the pirates' goal!

298
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,670
If we cross the Gates of Justice,

299
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,400
they won't be able to do anything at all!

300
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,360
Gather all of the CP9 members too!

301
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,370
Yes!

302
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,220
Well then...

303
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,180
Stand up you two!

304
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,500
You must urgently embark on your trip down to hell...

305
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We'll take our time to corner the pirates after this is done.

306
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,770
Giants!

307
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,260
Giants!

308
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,030
Giants are our allies!

309
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,090
Giants! Giants! Giants are our allies!

310
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,370
Everything they're doing is pretty interesting.

311
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,520
A sane person would never do anything against this island.

312
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,950
Giants!

313
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,590
Behold, Chimney.

314
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,220
Whether they die or survive in the end,

315
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,400
striving to achieve what nobody in the past
 hundreds years was able to do,

316
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,360
this incident will astound everyone in the world.

317
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,210
Once this battle is over,

318
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,020
that Straw Hat brat's name will

319
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,550
roar throughout the whole world!

320
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,970
ROBIIIIN!!!

321
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,280
He's here!

322
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,300
Luffy...

323
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,850
I CAME TO BRING YOU BACK!!!

324
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,880
Why are you trying to save me!?

325
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,890
Go back!

326
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,570
I don't even want to see your faces anymore!

327
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,060
Next time, One Piece: Answer Us, Robin!
 The Outcries of the Straw Hat Crew!

328
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,170
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

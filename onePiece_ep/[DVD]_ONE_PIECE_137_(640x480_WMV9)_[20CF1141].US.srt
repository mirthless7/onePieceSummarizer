1
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:07,410
How do you hope to pay?

2
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:07,410
Ambition of Zenny, prêteur sur gages.

3
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,610
Go, go, you cannot work more quickly than that?

4
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,530
I card-index myself that it is difficult!

5
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,300
Put more heart at the work!

6
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,980
Jii-san, remain calm!

7
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,800
We do our better for you.

8
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,600
All occurs well, Ojii-chan. You calm.

9
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,700
Do you want that I mass you the shoulders?

10
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,530
Is C-C' what this trick?

11
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,900
With the Jii-san fact, why do you build this boat at the top of the mountain?

12
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,580
Ah, it is not a boat.

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,130
It is not a boat?

14
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,570
Wait one moment!
If it is not a boat, it is what then?!

15
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,690
It is my…

16
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,040
… coffin.

17
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,700
Coffin?!

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,680
Ouais, it is my tomb.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,240
I see, then it is fall it from Ossan.

20
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,020
Do not request now! It is not the moment!

21
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,800
It is still too early!

22
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,560
It is too early for this kind of thing!

23
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,740
Could it be that it already carried out that there remain to him nothing any more but a few days to be lived?

24
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,540
What is there? You seem to me quite nervous…

25
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,740
… living alone on an island, there is nothing evil to build its own tomb!

26
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,940
Since I realized that I could possibly die…

27
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,640
It is not possibly…

28
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,820
… it is very close.

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,280
I suppose that a tomb at the top of a mountain it is not so strange only that.

30
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,670
But why a boat pirates like coffin?

31
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,830
Ji-Jii-san?

32
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,200
Await Jii-san!

33
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,770
Coffin, falls or anything…

34
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,230
… it is almost finished! Will not die!

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,500
Not now!

36
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,970
Chuuut, it just fell asleep.

37
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,700
I see, then you located the crew of the Straw hat.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,100
Mister! It seems that they accosted on the uninhabited island about which I spoke to you yesterday.

39
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,520
Well, prepare the fleet.

40
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,840
We will encircle the island with our complete fleet.

41
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,880
We will capture the crew of the Straw hat! Until the last!

42
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,420
Commander, wait please!

43
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,920
Some of the members of their crew ate a fruit of the demon.

44
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,710
And an invincible swashbuckler, Roronoa Zoro.

45
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,140
And then? You are afraid, Sergent Minchi?

46
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,750
Surely not. I want just to avoid useless sacrifices.

47
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,340
Whereas do suggest you?

48
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,970
If you follow my plan,

49
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,290
there will be no useless sacrifices!

50
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,580
And it will be a great victory for you, Commander!

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,220
Good…

52
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,520
Then, it is in my turn.

53
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,010
Licieux die…!

54
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,070
How do you make this cheese?

55
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,240
With lait de chèvre of the island.

56
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,160
Ca will reinvigorate your health.

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,800
But it is like sprinkling of water an ebullient rock.

58
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,800
[Japanese Proverb]

59
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,920
It is your turn, Ojii-chan.

60
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,570
And well…

61
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,670
… échec et mat.

62
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,240
With the king in defense.

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,260
Aaahh!! Wait please!

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,480
Not question of waiting, Nami-chan!

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,970
I lost…

66
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,720
Once again please!

67
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,930
Ok.

68
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,550
I am unbeatable with the failures when I eat cheese all while making me mass the shoulders.

69
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,650
Beautiful catch today!

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,920
Sanji, still prepares to us good dishes for Ossan!

71
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,550
Ouais, I occupy myself some!

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,500
Jii-san, if you need anything, do not hesitate to ask.

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,040
We will do all that we will be able!

74
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,390
Since I die, I would be happy.

75
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,630
It is like the paradise. The paradise.

76
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,510
Known as step that!

77
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,080
Even if it remains little of time…

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,530
… do not give up living…

79
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,490
… as long as you are still in life!

80
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,380
Does He, it do without what funny here?

81
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,420
What?

82
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,610
It was not supposed food only three days more?

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,360
Ouais, only three days more!

84
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,440
Only three days with living!

85
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,250
It is so short…

86
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,630
Ouais, but the three days passed for some time already.

87
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,940
Oh yes…

88
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,410
But then it could be that it is in perfect health?

89
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,300
It even seems to be better than front.

90
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,700
Cheese rab.

91
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,230
Jii-san, here your drugs for today.

92
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,990
Especially take them well.

93
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,940
I do not need that. Ca wastes the taste of my meal.

94
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,290
Here, échec et mat!

95
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,370
Aaahh, not yet!!

96
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,080
You said that there remained to him nothing any more but 3 days to be lived.

97
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,190
So that I see there, it seems in good health for the thirty next years.

98
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,660
Perhaps that you were wrong.

99
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,720
Not, I do not think.

100
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,590
But if I had made an error, that, isn't this would not be serious?

101
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,690
It is not the problem there!

102
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,660
If it is the case, I will leave this island, it does not matter what it can say!

103
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,580
Ouais, we do not have time to lose to remain here with dorloter eternally an old man!

104
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,350
I want to continue to live adventures on the seas.

105
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,480
Then it is regulated!

106
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,460
Nami, we are ready to set out again!

107
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,910
You cannot wait a little?

108
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,870
How long you still hope to remain to play?

109
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,970
Ca is enough with the failures!

110
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,440
And well, I cannot leave…

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,850
I lost many parts and maintaining the boat is with him.

112
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,230
WHAT?!

113
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,910
Which kind of pirate would bet his boat?

114
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,470
I will recover it! Just a moment!

115
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,590
Echec et mat.

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,370
Stop that!!

117
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,800
It is an earthquake!

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,140
Aaahh, that lasted enough, what will arrive to us!

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,340
If you want to recover your boat, you will have to regain it while working on this island…

120
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,040
… you will have to work about ten years…

121
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,170
… unless you have what to pay?

122
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
Nami-san…

123
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,910
Nami…

124
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,460
I am sorry…

125
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,330
I thought that if I gained, I could have asked him where its treasure was hidden…

126
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,900
You say that as so nothing was?

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,100
If it is right that, leaves this old man and leaves from here.

128
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,880
It is the only solution.

129
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,120
I do not want.

130
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,750
What do you say, Luffy?

131
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:33,750
If what Zoro says is true, we are likely to work for this old monkey the remainder of our life.

132
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,180
The guy, will be necessary to find a solution!

133
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,020
We will not live other adventures while remaining here, Luffy.

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,090
Let us leave from here.

135
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,480
Not!

136
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,240
Luffy!

137
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,160
Is a bet it like a promise, not?

138
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,210
Then I do not want to break our promise.

139
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,400
It is not the moment to be a defaitist!

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,470
Do Zoro, you think what of it?

141
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,900
The Captain is the only one who decides.

142
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,900
Luffy!

143
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,720
Y' does not have average.

144
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,200
Echec et mat.

145
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,320
It is…

146
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,010
It seems that one recovered our boat.

147
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,450
And well, Ojii-chan?

148
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,910
I lost!

149
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,610
Ouuuaaaiiis!

150
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,850
I knew that I could count on you, Onee-sama!

151
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,240
How do you hope to pay?

152
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,990
I suppose that…

153
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,950
I already lived a long life, but I had never met pirates as pleasant as you!

154
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,610
The guy, you are the best!

155
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,600
It is time to have fun the festival!

156
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,650
A festival with a feast!

157
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,020
Ojii-chan, you had to be a large pirate…

158
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,830
… you must be accustomed to drinking.

159
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,120
Nami-chan, why do you call me pirates?

160
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,000
If you had not been it, you would not have these fabulous cuts.

161
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,270
It is probable that comes from a treasure.

162
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,880
Wouldn't Nami, you be testing of the saouler so that he says to you where is the treasure?

163
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,480
You could not conceal to you!

164
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,070
Ossan, do you have really a treasure?

165
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,550
I said to you to close it!

166
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,650
There are other means for that.

167
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,720
My treasure is…

168
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,530
… those which held me company since the day when I made shipwreck here.

169
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,860
Goats of the island.

170
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,990
What a noble feeling!

171
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,570
I laugh!

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,240
Stop joking and spit the piece!

173
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,970
As you insist, here is my history…

174
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,800
I was a man who sailed on “Large Line” with the best pirates…

175
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:42,760
I knew it!

176
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,040
… and I lent money to them.

177
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,880
You lent money to them?

178
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,430
Ouais, one called me Zenny the prêteur sur gages. I am not a pirate.

179
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,570
You are not it?!

180
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
Damage for you, Nami.

181
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,540
But you crowned one notch to lend money to pirates, Jii-san.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,430
Why that?

183
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,020
Do you really think that normal pirates would restore what they stole?

184
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,610
You had to put your life in danger.

185
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,910
It is true.

186
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,850
They many times tried not to refund me.

187
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,450
These pirates puants break their promises as easily as they jump a meal.

188
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,280
Then you must hate the pirates.

189
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,960
If I had not held head to them, I would never have made any profit!

190
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,200
And each time, to recover my money, I was to face the pirates, face to face…

191
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,560
… risking my life on Large Line.

192
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,040
Isn't this a job where you were to be stronger than the pirates?

193
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,560
Ossan, are you strong?

194
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,900
Any pride put aside, I was weak.

195
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,010
But I had a dream.

196
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,580
A dream?

197
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,770
Ojii-chan?

198
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,520
What?! To recover the money?!

199
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,410
I am known under the name of Zenny the prêteur sur gages!

200
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,290
Until my death, I will not let anybody flee his debts!

201
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,440
You want to die with me?

202
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,160
Att-await, Zenny!

203
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,620
Unless you have what to pay?

204
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
And well then, good-bye!

205
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,200
Not so quickly!!

206
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,680
Do not forget that we are pirates!

207
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,160
He, not question! Ciao!

208
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,400
Zenny… How oses you…!

209
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,540
With the next one!

210
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,390
Although I was weak, I had a dream which helped me to beat me.

211
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,150
It is even for that I fought.

212
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,030
And this dream, it was what?

213
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,970
Since my childhood, I want to become a pirate.

214
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,020
A true pirate, the Lord of the Pirates.

215
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,990
It is for that I began my business of prêteur sur gages.

216
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,830
But one of these pirates puants destroyed my boat…

217
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,400
… and I failed on this island.

218
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,000
20 years ago of that.

219
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,190
Then you spent 20 years to build your tomb?

220
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,210
At the beginning, I wanted to build my boat close it shore and to leave from here, but…

221
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,170
… I could not bring wood until in bottom of the mountain.

222
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,550
But I did not give up, and I rather manufactured it at the top of the mountain.

223
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,950
I kept hope… for my great dream! For my great adventure!

224
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,090
With the wire of time, my great dream eclipsed gradually.

225
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:51,370
With time, although loan, I was too old to go on Grand Line.

226
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,690
Which dream? Which Pirate?

227
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,160
At the end, my dream was nothing any more but one dream like another.

228
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,060
Why do you give up, Ossan?

229
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,610
Hein?

230
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,170
It is not serious which you would be too old. You can always become pirate as long as you really wish it.

231
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,080
He He, Luffy. What will it occur if it takes to you with the word?

232
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,550
It still needs a flag and its boat is not yet completely finished.

233
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Sanji, meat.

234
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,850
Here!

235
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:19,820
Thank you.

236
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,530
It has just to reduce it from the mountain!

237
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,490
It is not as easy as that!

238
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,150
I see, then it is not too late…

239
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,880
Here, looks at! Now it took to you with the serious one.

240
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,530
Not, you right thirsty, isn't this is, Ojii-chan?

241
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,470
Ouais, I am thirsty. Very thirst!

242
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,300
Oh…

243
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
Straw hat, you helped me to open the eyes!

244
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,900
Let us carry a toast to the insane voyage of Zenny the pirate!

245
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,780
Ouaaaiiis!!

246
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,590
You really think that will go?

247
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,220
Can we really capture by ourself the crew of the Straw hat on the island?

248
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,380
As strong as they are, it is right a group of kids ignoramuses.

249
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,300
If you follow what I say, there is no reason to be afraid.

250
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,590
It is not as if I were going to beat me.

251
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,010
You have just to wait and look at.

252
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,270
Can the captain lose vis-a-vis the crew of the Straw hat?

253
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,650
How do you want that I know it?

254
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,420
After attracthaving attracted them in a trap, we will seek the treasure.

255
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,420
Corporal, you will play a significant role. And you will be well rewarded.

256
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,240
Or-yes, Mister.

257
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,630
Doesn't it matter that I would be old, hein?

258
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,180
By saying that to an old man who just wishes to carry out a dream…

259
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,650
Straw hat, you are a dirty villain.

260
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,370
Indeed.

261
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,500
Robin-chan.

262
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,570
He was once a woman who wished only to die. But this Captain saved it of his own boss.

263
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,760
Isn't this better than it is alive?

264
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,580
And well, I am not yet really sure…

265
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,540
You do not regret it.

266
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,340
I can see it on your face.

267
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,700
Robin-chan, your life does nothing but start.

268
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,170
But me… My dreams died here for always.

269
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,040
What does it occur?

270
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,410
Come quickly! The guy, you raise!

271
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,270
Slept well. It is the hour of the breakfast?

272
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,500
It is the Navy! The Navy is here!

273
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,400
What?!

274
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,620
Just a boat.

275
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,610
They do not seem to want to attack us.

276
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,010
What do they make here?

277
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,980
Hello everyone, crew of the Straw hat.

278
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,260
I am the Minchi Sergeant of the Marine fleet. Happy to meet you.

279
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,350
Happy to meet us?

280
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,340
Ouais, my excuses for the other day.

281
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,060
If I had known who you were, I would not have tried to pursue you.

282
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,780
And thus, I excuse myself some.

283
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,460
It is strange coming from your share. The Navy is supposed to pursue the pirates.

284
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,710
Ca seems too beautiful to be true.

285
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,700
We should be wary.

286
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,400
J I beg you, you do not annoy!

287
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,500
It is well your crew which beat Crocodile with Arabasta, isn't this?

288
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,650
It is not question of facing pirates such as you!

289
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,120
Please, believe me.

290
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,920
Moreover, if I had intended to fight you, I would not have come here with only one boat.

291
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,530
What a standard, it is afraid of us!

292
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,710
And by supposing that we fought you until death, us would not have benefitted any from it.

293
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,730
Whereas do make you here?

294
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,440
Oh, I came to explore this island.

295
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,580
As it is not on any of our charts, it is a new island which we do not know at all.

296
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,660
What do you hear by exploring? There are only here an old man and goats.

297
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Where did the old man pass besides?

298
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,940
I see! Then can we make a visit of courtesy in Zenny?

299
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,950
Zenny?

300
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,110
Once our finished investigation, we will turn over to our base.

301
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,410
And a small council. You should leave this place as soon as possible.

302
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,110
The general headquarter of the navy would like to see you all deaths.

303
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,510
I see. We should leave from here as fast as possible then.

304
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,570
I will take food.

305
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,120
And I will speak about it in Robin.

306
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,460
Aaah, it is…

307
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,710
… a trap! The Navy their tightened a trap!

308
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,560
Will we leave, Luffy?

309
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,220
Behind the fog, time is superb!

310
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,070
We will not stop you, then please leave.

311
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,400
I will leave when I would want of it! You will not decide that!

312
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,910
If I were in the Navy, I would try to fight us even with only one boat!

313
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,590
And another thing! How did you know that the name of Ojii-chan was Zenny?

314
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,640
It was not pronounced only once.

315
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,510
E-and well…

316
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,050
I do not know which kind of explorer you are, but that seems to me very suspect all that.

317
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,750
Would you know the treasure of Ojii-chan?

318
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,190
It, isn't this is surely that?

319
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,850
We cannot trust this type!

320
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:23,150
Then they know already the prêteur sur gages Zenny and its money mountain lent to the pirates…

321
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,170
Ouiiii, I always knew that Ojii-chan was rich!

322
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,490
I feel a gunpowder odor.

323
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,590
Does that come from these guns?

324
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,360
Ca does not come only from only one boat.

325
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,770
Ca comes from so much from guns which I cannot count them!

326
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,120
What do you say?

327
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,710
If we had taken the sea, we would have been attacked by these navires de guerre.

328
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,660
Salt false bottom!

329
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,340
I card-index myself number of ships which you have! Approach!

330
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,650
Have-await!

331
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,260
Excentric!

332
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,210
Usopp!

333
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,040
The guy!

334
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,550
Remain calm! Only one movement and he died!

335
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,610
Fact of shitting, they have already men on the island…

336
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,710
Good work, Corporal.

337
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,560
You, will say to them!

338
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,590
Wait, it is too late now.

339
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,710
Whereas should we make?

340
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,200
If we do not do anything, Straw hat risks…

341
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,030
It is terrible…

342
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,160
What can I make?

343
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,150
Isn't Ojii-san, you are a pirate?

344
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,380
Ridges something.

345
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,710
It is absurd!

346
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,080
I said that I was a pirate, but this boat is right my coffin.

347
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,550
And one is at the top of the mountain!

348
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,500
I donot can what make!

349
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,880
Then you have just to reduce it from the mountain!

350
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,820
The breeze of the island can help us to go down!

351
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,820
We will embark!

352
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,980
What do you wait?

353
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,000
All, let us release the wood supports! We will embark!

354
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,850
Throw your weapons with ground!

355
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,230
Or if not…

356
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,390
Usopp!

357
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,120
Shit…

358
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,570
The guy, flee!

359
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,650
They we will kill all in any event!

360
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,050
Close it!

361
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,630
Shit, band of cowards!

362
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,210
The Captain is not even yet there and it is already finished.

363
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,100
Corporal!

364
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,650
As I feared it.

365
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,950
It is not play!

366
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,930
The balls will not wound me!

367
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,030
And well, us, they will wound us!

368
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,250
In addition to Zenny, I will have had all the crew of the Straw hat!

369
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,520
Now, will die!

370
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,200
Ahead!

371
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,370
What? Does a boat pirate which goes down from the mountain?

372
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,190
Pirates of Zenny, with the attack!

373
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,100
Jii-san!

374
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,500
How do you hope to pay?

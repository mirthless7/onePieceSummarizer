1
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,825
USOPP HAMMER!

2
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,701
USOPP HAMMER!

3
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:40,827
USOPP WAGOMU!
(Rubberband!)

4
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,203
USOPP WAGOMU!
(Rubberband!)

5
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,563
HISSATSU KAEN BOSHI!
(Ultimate Fiery Flaming Star!)

6
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:08,980
HISSATSU KAEN BOSHI!
(Ultimate Fiery Flaming Star!)

7
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,233
USOPP HAMMER!

8
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:12,650
USOPP HAMMER!

9
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,109
USOPP HAMMER!

10
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,527
USOPP HAMMER!

11
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,576
I win...

12
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
To kill humans like you...

13
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,132
I don't need to do it myself... just
a little water is all it takes.

14
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:36,466
I don't need to do it myself... just
a little water is all it takes.

15
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,219
I don't need to do it myself... just
a little water is all it takes.

16
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,472
That's the difference between
you humans and us mermen.

17
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,069
Nami-aneki!

18
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,115
Yo, Nami.

19
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,744
I was just giving some loser pirates
a demonstration of our power.

20
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,455
What brings you here?

21
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm here... to kill you.

22
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:19,634
LUFFY'S BEST!
NAMI'S COURAGE AND THE STRAW HAT

23
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:19,759
LUFFY'S BEST!
NAMI'S COURAGE AND THE STRAW HAT

24
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,639
Here to...

25
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,808
kill me?

26
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,565
You still haven't given up.

27
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,695
How many times have you tried to
kill me, these past eight years?

28
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,907
Murder, poison, assault.

29
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,493
Has it ever worked?

30
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:51,541
You should know better than anyone else, that
we can't be killed by you humans so easily.

31
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,004
Listen, you can never kill me.

32
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,758
And you can never run away from me.

33
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,093
Nami.

34
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,681
You'll remain as my cartographer.

35
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,478
Besides, you know I've been good to you.

36
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,483
I really hope that you'll continue
the map-making, if possible.

37
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,782
So, how does this sound?

38
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:30,705
Because of what's happened, normally
I'd kill all of these people, except you.

39
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,212
But, if you make a decision now
to return to the Arlong Pirates,

40
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,256
and continue to draw maps for me...

41
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,345
I'll spare the people of Cocoyashi.

42
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:53,895
But these guys won't be spared.
They were too foolish.

43
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,022
So, it's your choice.

44
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,944
If you choose me, the people
of your village will be safe.

45
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,116
Or you could choose to fight
against me with these fools.

46
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,409
But, these guys you hope to count on
are in such bad shape right now...

47
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,702
But, these guys you hope to count on
are in such bad shape right now...

48
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,912
But, these guys you hope to count on
are in such bad shape right now...

49
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,124
I don't think there's any way to
avoid this ending in tragedy.

50
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,128
Nami.

51
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,464
Are you my nakama,

52
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,510
Or are you theirs?

53
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,973
No way...

54
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,477
If I say I'm Luffy's nakama, everyone will be killed.

55
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,973
If I go back to Arlong, then everyone
from the vllage will be safe...

56
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,027
It's all up to me... Everyone's fate...

57
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,239
You bastard!

58
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,034
No matter what your say, you just want to keep her!

59
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,245
But!

60
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,095
Help me...

61
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,595
DAMN RIGHT!!

62
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,642
I can't doubt what he said!

63
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,190
Everyone, I'm sorry!

64
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,692
Will you die with me?

65
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,781
YOSHA!!

66
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,740
Let's go!

67
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:38,249
So, you wish to be slaughtered.

68
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,926
Plea- please, please...!

69
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,472
Live! Live! Live! Live! Live!

70
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,525
What's that?

71
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,696
There he is...

72
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,198
All that's left is for me to take
care of the block on his feet.

73
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,449
What?

74
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,370
I get it now.

75
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,621
Can it be?

76
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
Luffy-aniki!!

77
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:20,583
Hey kid, hang on!

78
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,420
Hey kid, hang on!

79
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,599
Thirty seconds.

80
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,268
I can't hold on any longer than that.

81
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,022
Zoro...

82
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,482
That's more than enough!

83
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,903
I don't remember a fountain there.

84
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,740
Could it be that rubber bastard?

85
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,414
That's not what you should be
worried about right now...

86
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,749
You half-fish bastard!

87
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,004
Didn't I tell you never to say that word again?

88
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,256
Looks like you're about finished, Zoro!

89
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,390
If I can just break that block, then he'll be free.

90
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,600
Luffy...

91
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,895
You're the only one who can take him out now!

92
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,612
Those with the power of the Devil's Fruit
lose all strength when they're in the sea.

93
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,782
He should be dead by now.

94
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,202
If he's still alive...

95
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,664
Then someone must've been messing
around with my little game.

96
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,876
Hey! Are you okay! Thank God!

97
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,878
Hah... huh?!

98
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,046
What? What is it?

99
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,717
Ossan, where's your pinwheel?
It was so freakin' cool.

100
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,053
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? THIS ISN'T THE TIME!

101
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,223
Messing up your game?

102
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,143
I thought it was messed up to begin with, bastard.

103
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,273
Whatever, I'll find out who's doing it.

104
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,192
Move.

105
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:09,818
Move.

106
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,071
TAMAGO BOSHI!
(Egg Star!)

107
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:13,530
TAMAGO BOSHI!
(Egg Star!)

108
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:13,780
TAMAGO BOSHI!
(Egg Star!)

109
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,493
I've got you covered, Zoro!

110
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,705
Usopp-aniki! Are you alright?

111
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,125
How brave! He's facing him without fear!

112
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,585
Oh yeah! I fight with no fear!

113
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,379
Why are you over THERE?!

114
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,506
Usopp!

115
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,299
Hey Nami, check it out!

116
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,637
One of their guys, one of 'em was finished
off by ME! Me, of all people!

117
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,764
A guy with a face like this...

118
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,768
These mermen are NOTHING!

119
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,441
Chew! You bastard...

120
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,736
You betcha!

121
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,072
My appearance signals the climax of this battle!

122
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,366
Get ready for the big finale!

123
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,669
Hey... Can't you break it by yourself?

124
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,004
Nope. No way.

125
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,756
I'm totally powerless right now.

126
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,676
Come on... come on, come on!

127
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,389
Oh! It's our Cook-aniki!

128
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,642
I'm not sure what's going on underwater,

129
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,562
but right now, whatever Cook-aniki's
doing is crucial...

130
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:32,108
Zoro-aniki! Stand fast to stop Arlong!

131
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:39,282
Yosh! Just stop Arlong from getting
into the water, right?

132
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,868
I can handle that.

133
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:49,459
Not a chance, you bastards!

134
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,587
Hey ARLONG! Over here, dork!

135
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,466
Usopp-aniki!

136
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,385
He's so brave!

137
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,096
USOPP WAGOMU!

138
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,972
USOPP WAGOMU!

139
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,932
You dare to stand in my way?

140
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:04,974
You dare to stand in my way?

141
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,062
You want to be the first to die, Roronoa Zoro?

142
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,398
Now! Go, Zoro!

143
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,400
Hey! What're you trying to do?

144
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,654
I will not die.

145
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,490
Allow me to break that ugly nose you love so dearly!

146
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,705
Fool...

147
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,916
I love it because it's unbreakable.

148
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:37,674
If you weren't hurt so badly, you might've
given it a bruise or a scratch.

149
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,649
Aniki...

150
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,984
Look, over there!

151
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,113
Ah! That octopus jerk woke up!

152
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,409
Huh? What's he doing?

153
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,874
Crap! I thought a rubber band was coming!

154
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,375
WHAT THE HELL?!

155
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,086
WHAAAT?!

156
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,007
Of course, I was aiming for him!

157
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,551
Didn't you shout, ''ARLONG?''

158
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:23,928
Octopus...

159
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,184
Roronoa Zoro! I won't let you get away with this!

160
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,937
Watch how I kill your nakama in the water!

161
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:45,492
Don't get frustrated, you'll all be dead soon enough.

162
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,417
ANIKIIII!!

163
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,215
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

164
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,382
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

165
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,263
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

166
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,426
Nami-san's Onee-sama, leave the rest to me!

167
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,431
A merman!

168
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,268
Watch out, please, Onee-sama.

169
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,186
I'll take care of that with a single kick!

170
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,152
The Octopus!

171
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,114
TAKOYAKI PUNCH!

172
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,365
ONEE-SAMA!!

173
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,458
ZORO!!!

174
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,715
Done already? How boring.

175
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,303
By the way, what's with this huge bandage?

176
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,432
Did you fall somewhere or something?

177
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,271
Holy shit, what's with this wound...?

178
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,872
How can he still be living with this body?

179
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,000
How can he still stand?

180
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,931
What's with the look on his face?

181
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,301
Is this the look of a dying man?

182
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,063
No doubt.

183
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:25,276
He HAS to die. I have to do it right now.

184
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:38,039
If you take it easy, the wounds won't open...

185
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,958
That's all you have to say?

186
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,794
You think you're funny, don't you?

187
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:51,136
I didn't mean me. I meant the octopus guy.

188
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,096
What?

189
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:54,681
I told you before.

190
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,851
We've already won this game.

191
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,578
SHIT.

192
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,706
That had me scared!

193
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,880
This is all your fault! You had
to go complicate things!

194
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,178
Get outta here, you piece of shit!

195
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,930
Go beat the hell out of that freakin' shark's ass!!

196
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,851
Is it coming, kid?

197
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,228
Yeaaah!!!

198
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,449
I'm BAAACK!!

199
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,119
Rubber boy!

200
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,456
Luffy-aniki!!

201
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,214
Luffy!

202
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,761
That rubber bastard...

203
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:17,889
You're late, idiot.

204
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:20,975
Zoro!

205
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,104
Hey, stop it!

206
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:25,563
You're not gonna...

207
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,736
SWITCH!!!

208
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,990
YOU MORON!!

209
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,537
GOMU GOMU NO KANE!
(Bell!)

210
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,124
MUCHI!
(Whip!)

211
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,410
GOMU GOMU NO!

212
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,010
PISTOLET!

213
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,057
GATLING GUN!

214
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,229
TAKE THAT!!!

215
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:11,985
Done!

216
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,073
No way...

217
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,587
Did you think that'd do anything?

218
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,631
Not a single scratch?!

219
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,593
Nope. Just warmin' up.

220
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,809
I'll... kill him!

221
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,781
What's wrong with you, you pathetic scum?

222
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:03,244
I think you would have been happier
sleeping at the bottom of the ocean.

223
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:07,248
No, actually, I'm pretty thankful
to have been rescued.

224
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,505
Because then you wouldn't have
to see how angry I am.

225
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,009
To see my brethren killed by your lame pals...

226
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,891
Soon enough, you're going to be
wishing you had died earlier.

227
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,553
Luffy-aniki is going to be all right, isn't he?

228
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,357
All of his attacks, did no damage!

229
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:36,194
More importantly, where did Zoro-aniki land?

230
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,445
Go, Luffy! I've got your back covered!

231
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,739
Go, Luffy! I've got your back covered!

232
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,199
I don't think that'll help!

233
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,460
If he loses, you're all gonna die, aren't you?

234
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,754
So it seems.

235
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,724
And then, East Blue will be done for, too.

236
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,060
Do you know what the difference
is between me and you?

237
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:11,938
Noses.

238
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:16,142
Chins?

239
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,071
Is Aniki... trying to joke around with him?

240
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,033
No, I'm afraid he's quite serious.

241
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,285
Oh, the webs!

242
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,580
It's our very race!

243
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,472
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

244
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,390
His teeth must be...

245
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:57,108
He bit the column to pieces!

246
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,194
Scary!

247
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,155
Holy shit, what is this guy?

248
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,408
Those teeth... they wouldn't just scar
him if he were toget bitten...

249
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,202
It'd go through and break his bones, too!

250
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:12,707
Behold.

251
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,919
This is the true power of mermen.

252
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,422
The Heavens have made a distinction between us.

253
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:24,344
The Heavens only gave you humans
enough strength to exist below us.

254
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,392
You are inferior animals!

255
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,105
From the very moment we were
born, everything was different.

256
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:42,237
I'll show you just how different we really are.

257
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,951
Sure, show me.

258
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,070
But there's no way in hell I'll lose to you fish-people.

259
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,614
Because I'm...

260
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,200
The man who'll become the Pirate King!

1
00:00:01,116 --> 00:00:02,766
Good, then…

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,900
Franky Family and engineers of Galley it…

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,233
There were the small different ones downtown,
but now, there is a common enemy.

4
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:16,366
Listen. We are allied!

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,500
One will be crushed!

6
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:40,766
ONE… ONE PASSED!!

7
00:00:43,316 --> 00:00:44,582
Yo, Luffy!

8
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,566
Ah, Sanji!

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,500
How does that do without tone with dimensions? Where is Robin?

10
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,366
Robin-chan is always captive.

11
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:56,515
Nami-san put to me with the current
circumstances of our situation.

12
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:57,833
I see.

13
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,433
Ah, it is thus that.

14
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,849
Them foutre goes a beating.

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,766
Luffy, do not say anything!

16
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:10,300
Say to him to await us.

17
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:12,782
He, cook? You hear me?

18
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:14,782
There are dangerous types in this train…

19
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,166
That will go.

20
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,633
Zoro…

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,233
What would you have made?

22
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:31,033
When you known ace that Robin had lied and
that it had been let capture to save us…

23
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,366
Could you have remained without anything to make?

24
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,833
Useless to stop it.

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,182
Oï, Marimo-kun! You worry for me?!

26
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:43,633
In your dreams! Cretin!

27
00:01:43,783 --> 00:01:45,766
But unfortunately…

28
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:49,566
When I learned the reasons from Robin-chan…

29
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,966
Even an order of the captain…

30
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,766
could not stop me!

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,466
I…

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,466
do not come.

33
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,833
That does not relate to me any more.

34
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:10,249
Moreover, if the world government is against us…

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,166
I do not want to be implied, and…

36
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:16,400
Will Luffy and the others arrive, not truth?

37
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,633
I am sorry for Robin,

38
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,900
but me…

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,916
I am not obliged to go to save it!

40
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,900
I left the crew!

41
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,833
Hello.

42
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:40,766
Ah! I found them!

43
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,166
Ah, shit!

44
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:52,700
Who is there?!

45
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,100
Me was explained all the situation.

46
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,433
I believed to understand that you wish
to save an young woman.

47
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:09,233
I do not need another reason to help you.

48
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,633
Let to me fight with your with dimensions!

49
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:20,100
My name is…

50
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,633
Sogeking!

51
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,900
SOGEKING
TIREUR D'ÉLITE

52
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:46,300
ON the ISLAND OF the SNIPERS

53
00:03:46,316 --> 00:03:50,115
I AI CONSIDERING the DAY

54
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:53,582
100 SUCCESSFUL SHOOTINGS, 100 BLOWS

55
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,049
LU LU LU ~

56
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,582
THAT IT IS the EYE Of a MOUSE

57
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,382
LOCKED TARGET!!

58
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:02,633
OR YOUR HEART

59
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:06,700
LOCKED TARGET!!

60
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:14,033
VIS-A-VIS THE MAN WHO COMES FROM THE ISLAND OF THE SNIPERS

61
00:04:14,116 --> 00:04:17,449
LU LU LU LU LU IT

62
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:23,366
YOU WOULD MAKE BETTER FLEE!

63
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,950
SOGEKING SOGE SOGE

64
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,366
SOGE KINGU

65
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:49,550
A MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCE!?
ITS NAME EAST SOGEKING!

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,450
But what it fout bong blood?

67
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:20,050
He well, leaves it in its is delirious.

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,716
I suppose that he thinks of not being able
to save his/her friend directly.

69
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,183
It has these ideas with the idiot.

70
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,800
Oï, is brought back!

71
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,816
Ah, yes.

72
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:43,850
Yosh, the mission of rescue
of Robin-chan can finally begin.

73
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:50,000
Dear Sirs, it is the first time that one
meets, do not have you any question?

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,532
First of all, you were in coach N. 6.

75
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,716
There thus remain still five about it.

76
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:57,866
Like, “Where the island of the snipers is?”

77
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,799
Robin-chan is inevitably in one of them.

78
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,516
The answer is, “In your hearts”.

79
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,983
Good, be to you hefty man?

80
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,532
I am super hefty man! Cretin!

81
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:11,400
And I am to it even more this week.

82
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,216
Our mission will end when us
will have recovered Robin-Chan…

83
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,483
But there is a good package of enemies.

84
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:21,816
One cannot sink lowered head, one would be
handicapped in these narrow cars.

85
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:27,400
It should be avoided the useless combat,
and to take strongest one by one.

86
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,999
Ouais, it is true.

87
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,466
It is a good way of apprehending the combat.

88
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,783
You are somebody of intelligent, Sanji-kun.

89
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:36,683
Consequently, I have a plan.

90
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,516
Listen attentively.

91
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,850
It… It is…

92
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,950
Superb…

93
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,550
Yosh! I am ready for the combat!

94
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,733
What does it arrive to you?

95
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,332
WHAT IT ARRIVES TO THEM, HAS YOUR OPINION?!

96
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:21,516
How you can change here, trailed?!

97
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,783
Pretty trail!

98
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,666
I did not have the choice! There is only one coach.

99
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,200
COVER YOUR BELLY! YOUR BELLY AND YOUR LEGS!

100
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,866
THAT APPLIES TO YOU ALSO THE PUBLIC GARDEN!

101
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:36,250
It IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU
HOW COMPANY SE DÉVERGONDE!

102
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,332
The farm, wedged!

103
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,516
Wedged!

104
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,050
SPECIES OF…

105
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,916
Perhaps what should I also change me?

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,465
PLEASE!
FOR the Love of god, MADE NOT THAT!

107
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:50,650
Which band of insolents.

108
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,250
Whore…

109
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:59,199
These black pants… it have pockets,
but why they are not larger?

110
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,383
Mets not of meat in your pockets!

111
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,316
You all seem very justified the young people.

112
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,732
I see that you are ready to leave.

113
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,999
Of course! We there will save Robin, after all!

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,132
This time, I all will massacre them!

115
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,650
Of course!?

116
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,050
If you are made beat once again,
I will not forgive myself it!

117
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:22,132
That will go. I have a good reason for
not to lose this time!

118
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,583
A reason?

119
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,450
Nami, you changed ace of weapon?

120
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,783
When the celestial islands were left…

121
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:34,450
Usopp used of Dials to make a better weapon of it.

122
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,850
Perfect Climate Tact!

123
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,199
I see, it is Usopp which…

124
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,250
Ouais, Usopp has…

125
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:45,116
Its posthumous work…

126
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,050
Stop depressing!

127
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,183
Loans? Ok, allons-y.

128
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,250
Of the intruders?

129
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,583
Yes. We received this report/ratio.

130
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,850
It is impossible to go up on board of
Puffing Tom once this one moving.

131
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,732
So intruding, there is…

132
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:20,450
they were to be on board from the beginning.

133
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,650
It is pathetic.

134
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,917
You are right. We are sorry…

135
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:29,850
But to leave the train moving is also impossible.

136
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:34,350
The intruders and the criminals are
still on board Umi Ressha.

137
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,050
Excavate all and find them.

138
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,183
Yes!

139
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,983
“Coach N. 7”

140
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,317
T-Bone captain.

141
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,617
It is impossible to hide in a so small coach.

142
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,983
Good evening!

143
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,199
THEY ARE!

144
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,599
They are behind the door!

145
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,199
They are three with the intruder!

146
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,650
They are in coach N. 7,
wedge them and capture them!

147
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,333
You donot can even use a hammer.

148
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,183
The farm!

149
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,917
Do not slacken your effort!

150
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,850
Open this door!

151
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,983
Hurry to nail it!

152
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,383
Received B-Bien.

153
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,266
Everyone by here! Criminals
are in coach N. 7.

154
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,466
They were there?!

155
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,400
Prevent also those of coach N. 3!

156
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,999
Wedge them and capture alive Franky!

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,317
They do not have nowhere where to go!
Capture them!

158
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,517
Oï! Move back!

159
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,266
They opened fire!

160
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,666
Magne, Soge!

161
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,450
I helps then!

162
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,450
Do not draw anywhere! They should not be killed!

163
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:02,783
Shit!

164
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,650
T-Bone captain!

165
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,450
You draw aside!

166
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,783
I hate the indirect combat.

167
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,317
CHOKKAKU SENKO

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,183
BONE SOWARU

169
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:47,300
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

170
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:59,467
I hate the indirect combat.

171
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,733
CHOKKAKU SENKO

172
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:07,400
BONE SOWARU

173
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,467
They left!

174
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,867
On the roof.

175
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,633
You dispatch, the enemy is in the last coach!

176
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,933
It is the moment, quickly!

177
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,067
That cannot be.

178
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,882
How everyone turns over in the preceding coach!

179
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,482
It is a trap!

180
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:53,400
A trap?!

181
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,549
What…

182
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,883
Made half-turn! It is a trap!

183
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,067
What?!

184
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:01,017
One cannot go back there, the door was closed!

185
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,133
Who did that?

186
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:06,867
The coach was detached!

187
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,682
WHAT?!

188
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:10,682
Shit!

189
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:11,883
It was them!

190
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:13,933
You will regret it!

191
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,800
It is too late.

192
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,350
Hello everyone.
Made attention with the monstres marins. And good voyage.

193
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,133
Good-bye.

194
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:31,700
Already two coaches in less, one reduced
the number of enemies from approximately fifty.

195
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,349
But, Sanji-kun,

196
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,217
Luffy with the Straw hat and the others
travel on the same rails, not?

197
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,267
Bah, they will manage.

198
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,082
B-band of refuse!

199
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,933
I will smash the door!

200
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,600
Ah, you us free already?

201
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:56,033
Go, more than five coaches.

202
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:59,683
Born do not think of drawing you like that!

203
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:01,883
How you could do that with the T-Bone Captain?!

204
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,017
He, bring back-that with the CP9!

205
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,867
There remain still the null ones here.

206
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,600
STRONG RIGHT!

207
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,700
Heavy weapons, DRAW!

208
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,400
It was touched!

209
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,300
That hurt.

210
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,367
Draw, car!

211
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,433
Why my balls do not do anything to him?!

212
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:16,900
O-Oï! What be to you?!

213
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:21,017
I am a cyborg.

214
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:22,683
Cyborg?!

215
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:26,767
Ouais. I have steel plates and
weapons integrated into my body.

216
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,683
When me above am drawn,
I have a little badly and it sometimes happens to me to bleed…

217
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,733
but that cannot kill me.

218
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,033
This kind of thing thus exists?

219
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,416
The world is vast.

220
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,800
Impressing!

221
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,133
AIIEE!!!

222
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,600
What you insane, dumb?!

223
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,149
A simple needle should not hurt you?

224
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,150
Be weak for you! You want me to dissect or what?

225
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,817
First of all, my back is different! Listen…

226
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:56,949
I had to modify me all alone…

227
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,083
thus my hands could not go behind!

228
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,500
Only half of front is cyborg!

229
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,550
As long as we are there,
let to me say another thing.

230
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,617
My belly is always cold. Do you know why?

231
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:10,800
I know anything of it.

232
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,950
Because in my belly,
there a refrigerator has to keep the Coke with the expenses.

233
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,416
Oh, it is impressive!

234
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,867
It is brilliant! For the days when the weather is hot!

235
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,882
It is not the moment to speak about that!

236
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:29,467
There are no more enemies in it
coach! Let us pass to the following!

237
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,833
It is with the turn of the fourth coach.

238
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,433
“Coach N. 4”

239
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,549
It is Wanze!

240
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,533
It is Wanze theinsane one!

241
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,400
Sift, it is Wanze!

242
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,867
Hello the guy!

243
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,082
You are hungry? I am Wanze.

244
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,482
It is the kitchen, I can do everything.

245
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,882
Ramen? Ok, I make you ramen!

246
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:12,550
But initially, I would like to teach you something.

247
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:18,149
The hairs of my nose have this provision,
they are like a strainer.

248
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,000
Do not forget it!

249
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,033
First of all, I put flour
in my mouth and I mix well.

250
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,667
Here! Good appetite!

251
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:40,133
One does not want any!!

252
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:43,933
Much time was lost.

253
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,333
Wanze, there is a person who awaits us.

254
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,000
We are pressed, go… hello.

255
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,133
Attendeeeez!!

256
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,482
If you want to cross this coach…

257
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:57,867
you will have initially to overcome me!

258
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:05,616
Would you try to stop us?

259
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,549
I will do it, sift!

260
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:15,600
If something arrives during the mission
of escort of this Umi Ressha, I am lààà!

261
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:18,149
If you want to save the criminal one,

262
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,533
try to beat my Ramen Kenpo.

263
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,782
Ra-Ramen Kenpo?!

264
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:26,667
“Ra-Ramen Kenpo?!”

265
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,216
Stop me imitating, dumb!

266
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,883
Do not answer its provocation, cretin!
It is until it waits!

267
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,216
Sifsaaa!

268
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,882
You like my weak imitations?

269
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:38,682
I said, do not answer!

270
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,816
Sift!!

271
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,133
Which energetic guy.

272
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,667
What? However the balls should have touched it…

273
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,550
That did not even make it react. What a coolness!

274
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,617
J-J' believed well that I was going to remain there…

275
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:02,017
You flippais?!
Stop making this mug with the idiot!

276
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,667
I undertake this clown!

277
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,200
Wait, wait!

278
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:09,617
Of the guy as you are too easy to cause…

279
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:11,267
that would be a waste of time.

280
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,467
I will undertake some quickly made well done.

281
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,633
That me fout nerves that a cretin
like you says itself to being a cook chief.

282
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,833
I SPEAK TO YOU, DUMB!!

283
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:29,000
It IS YOU WHO YIELDS TO the PROVOCATION!!

284
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,367
But looks at! It avoided the blow
of foot of Sanji so easily.

285
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,167
How does it make to have as much insurance?

286
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,950
I believed well that I was going to remain there!

287
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,350
THEN YOU FLIPPAIS?!

288
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,200
WOULD BE SERIOUS, BROTHEL!

289
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,667
At all events…

290
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,667
let to me take care some…

291
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,767
and go in the next coach.

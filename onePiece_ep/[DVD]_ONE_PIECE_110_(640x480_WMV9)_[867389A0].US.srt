1
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:40,420
The pitiless combat died!

2
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:40,420
Luffy VS Crocodile

3
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,500
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,410
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,400
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,780
Luffy and its crew were victims of a trap tended in Rain Dinners.

7
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,190
But thanks to the intervention of Sanji,
they finally managed to escape.

8
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,830
Colonel Smoker was saved drowning…

9
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,930
… and allowed Luffy and its crew to escape.

10
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,340
The kingdom of Arabasta in ruin, or will reach fall a durable peace?

11
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,400
The sand glass of the destiny counts the number of second remaining.

12
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,280
They flee!

13
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,760
Continue them!

14
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,870
They are there!

15
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,850
They are there!

16
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,560
Catch them!

17
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,610
Colonel!

18
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,480
You do not continue them?

19
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Not, I am tired.

20
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,410
Tired?

21
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,050
Yes.

22
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,130
Well!

23
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,740
Stop the continuation.
They will not have them.

24
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,620
Order the gathering.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,330
Contact the general headquarter.

26
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,030
Ask them to requisition all the men-of-war near the kingdom of Arabasta…

27
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,280
… and that they immediately travel towards this country.

28
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,980
Reinforcements?

29
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,180
But, Colonel…

30
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,050
I do not know if our superiors will like the idea to send as many boats right for some pirates!

31
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,620
Since when I deal with my superiors?

32
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,400
Oh… Yes!

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,550
Immediately!

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,130
He!

35
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,630
Return!

36
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,120
Stop!

37
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,110
Here me is!

38
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,180
Ouais, it is this road.

39
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,120
The odor of the perfume of Nami becomes increasingly strong!

40
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,680
He! Me known as step which one will run like that until Alubarna!

41
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,550
Oh, Matsuge!

42
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,610
Where did Matsuge leave!?

43
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,930
While thinking of it!

44
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,210
There is many stables in this city, not!?

45
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,410
Let us find some horses!

46
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,520
But, the city is filled men of the Navy!

47
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,370
Do not worry you!

48
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,640
Look at over there.

49
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,320
He! Everyone!

50
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,820
A CRAB!?

51
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,040
Chopper!

52
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,010
It is a Mobile Crab!

53
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,870
Ca with the good air!

54
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,420
COOL!

55
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,260
Brilliant! Super! Terrible!

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,700
Impressing! Cool!

57
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,520
Go up!

58
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,250
One can go up above!?

59
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,580
Glad to meet you!

60
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,050
It does not look at us a little oddly?

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,010
You still brought something of narcotic with you.

62
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,460
It is a friend of Matsuge!

63
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,650
Matsuge was born in this city,

64
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,380
thus it has everywhere full with friends in the neighborhoods!

65
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,430
But they all are perverse…

66
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,340
Nutcase!

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,870
The Mobile Crabs remain hidden in sand so much a long time…

68
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,960
how they are regarded as legends, but there is of it a front us!

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,850
It is rather fast, not?

70
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,770
Everyone, you hang well!

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,740
Yosh! Caution!

72
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,910
One left!

73
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,630
Stop! Chopper!

74
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,500
It is him!

75
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,030
This dumb…!

76
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,630
He, Luffy!

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,200
What a idiotic!

78
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,500
Luffy-San!

79
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,550
And the others must continue you to advance!

80
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,310
ALL WILL GO WELL FOR ME!

81
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,110
You ensure that it arrives over there without risk!

82
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,600
Bring back Vivi at it!

83
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,600
Made blunder!

84
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,580
Made blunder, hein?

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,870
Imbecile…

86
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,510
He!

87
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,340
One goes there, Chopper!

88
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,250
On the way towards Alubarna!

89
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,190
Yes.

90
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,250
Included/understood well.

91
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
ONE GOES THERE!

92
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,990
Have-await two seconds!

93
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,890
He! He, Zoro!

94
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,020
You will not leave it here!?

95
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,250
Aren't He, a little cruel for you!?

96
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,460
Be to you cruel sacrament but…

97
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,500
you will protect me better now!

98
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,910
Why do you do all that for me!?

99
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,790
ANSWER me!

100
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,850
LUFFY-SAN!

101
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,680
All will be well, Vivi!

102
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,560
It will be left there!

103
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,050
I am more anxious for him!

104
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,070
Once Luffy chooses its enemy…

105
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,110
… it is never left there unscathed!

106
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,390
Listen, Vivi.

107
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,650
It will deal with Crocodile.

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,170
Time that the rebellious army manages to attack.

109
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,590
Time for this country is counted.

110
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,550
If the royal army and the army rebel meet,

111
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,990
it will be the end of this country, the kingdom of Arabasta.

112
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,060
And if you are the only one who can stop them…

113
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,140
then you must remain in life, it does not matter the price to be paid.

114
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,720
Henceforth, no matter what it arrives to us…

115
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,690
… that does not have any more importance!

116
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,650
M- But…

117
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,270
Vivi-Chan.

118
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,070
You founded this combat.

119
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,230
You left your country a few years ago,

120
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,460
to defy an organization of which you did not know anything.

121
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,370
In any case…

122
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,670
you cannot say but you any more engagements only, from now on.

123
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,070
V-Vivi!! Born does not worry you!

124
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,840
I… I… will protect you!

125
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,990
LUFFY-SAN!!

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
LUFFY-SAN…

127
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,030
WE WILL AWAIT You has ALUBARNA!!

128
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
… WILL AWAIT You…!

129
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,700
… WILL AWAIT You…!

130
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,480
OUAIS!

131
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,440
She east flees, not?

132
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
Princess Vivi.

133
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,490
In any case, the Agents in Alubarna are already ready to receive their orders.

134
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,690
Come into contact with them immediately.

135
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,320
I find…

136
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,810
… that your small horse-gear lasted long enough, Luffy with the straw hat.

137
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,830
You know it well…

138
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,000
Although it is weak, it will still try to save everyone.

139
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,130
It is always sad because it cannot support to give up somebody.

140
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,990
She even wishes that this rebellion finishes without any death.

141
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,400
Without any death?

142
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,670
It pacifist stupid there and limited many like that.

143
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,140
Those which do not know the truth of this battle.

144
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,340
You are of agreement with me, not?

145
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,630
Ouais.

146
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,270
But as long as you will remain in life,

147
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,130
it will fight to its last breath.

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,250
It is for that I must…

149
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,400
… to stop you here!

150
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,440
It is more than pitiful.

151
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,040
You are nothing more than one idiot.

152
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,030
You are a perfect example.

153
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,770
Those which conspire with others die because of that.

154
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,100
I left a hundred like that of it behind me.

155
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,870
Eh well…

156
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,550
Does Ca show that are quite stupid for you, not?

157
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,390
You find that funny?

158
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,550
Perhaps that I should kill you too.

159
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,210
Nico Robin.

160
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,110
If it is what you think,
made as you want.

161
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,000
And what did it arrive at your promise not to call me by this name?

162
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,200
Where do you go?

163
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,860
I go from this step to Alubarna.

164
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,770
Which imperceptible woman.

165
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,560
I grant 3 minutes to you.

166
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,370
After that,

167
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,130
I will not have any more time to play with you.

168
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,680
I grant 3 minutes to you.

169
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,660
After that, I will not have any more time to play with you.

170
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,500
A problem?

171
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,060
Not. Ca will suit me very well.

172
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,860
Let to me say a thing, Luffy with the straw hat.

173
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,670
It does not matter how you fight.

174
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,020
Somebody as will never arrive to you…

175
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
Listen, Luffy with the straw hat.

176
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,840
Your pitiful attacks are like punctures of mosquitos.

177
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,180
Ca is not used for only you continuous.

178
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,310
Somebody as will never arrive to you…

179
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,590
You! Dirtiness! Dumb!

180
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,860
I burst you!?

181
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,440
Stupid Croco of sands!

182
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,450
I said to you that it was useless.

183
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,250
You, dumb!

184
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,100
It does not matter how you fight, elastic man.

185
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,230
Somebody as will never arrive to you at me…

186
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,260
… Beats…

187
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,960
“BEATS”!?

188
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,390
What try to you to say!?

189
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,130
I find that I had fun long enough.

190
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,170
Luffy with the straw hat.

191
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,660
I always fought seriously!

192
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,390
But there… Good blood!

193
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,580
I am not even able to touch it!

194
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,280
It disappears all the time.

195
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,340
You and me…

196
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,720
… sums of the pirates of different classes.

197
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,290
Beautiful dodging…

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,630
If that had touched you, you would have regretted it.

199
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,820
What!?

200
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,520
The desert was split into two!

201
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,600
According to the way in which you use and improve the Fruit of the Demon,

202
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,960
it can become an incredible weapon in a battle.

203
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,340
I am not as these cretins who are glad to have only capacities.

204
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,460
You will regret being to you found on my road…

205
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,250
What?

206
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,200
Hein? What? It is what?

207
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,160
Sand!

208
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,040
He aspires to me!

209
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,860
You never heard of moving sands?

210
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,390
The desert is a convenient coffin.
No tomb is necessary.

211
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,200
Sand is grabbed by an underground river.

212
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,840
Thanks to my capacities, I can determine his exact place.

213
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,040
Combatant in the desert, nobody in this world can hope to beat me.

214
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,340
This rotten sand…

215
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,850
… will not be sufficient to bury me alive!

216
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,360
Dumb…!

217
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,400
As I cannot strike you,
I will capture you in the place!

218
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,920
Friend = Net

219
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,480
You do not want to listen to me?

220
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,460
It is useless.

221
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,580
Muchi = Whip

222
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,070
Am I obliged to always repeat the same things?

223
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,940
Release me, dumb!

224
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,410
My arm!

225
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,410
My arm! My arm!!

226
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,730
A mummy would be said!

227
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,920
My arm was transformed into a mummy!

228
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,200
It is because of sand.

229
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,150
He aspired all the water contained in your arm.

230
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,640
I should perhaps aspire all the water of your body and kill you.

231
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,950
So to speak, here a first impression of the desert.

232
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,330
It is not very funny!

233
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,430
It is that!

234
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,800
WATER!

235
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,630
Useless.

236
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,870
It is not useless!

237
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,970
This water…

238
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,080
… was given to me by Ossan with Yuba after it spent all the night to be dug!

239
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,080
Ossan = Old man

240
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,740
Luffy-Kun…

241
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,660
Take this with you, please.

242
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,880
You know what Ossan said?

243
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,530
Yuba will never be destroyed by only one grain of sand!

244
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,790
You persist in continuing?

245
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,650
DECREE TO PLAY WITH MY NERVES!

246
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,550
Die…

247
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,750
… with the “cordial” ground of Yuba.

248
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,610
Your 3 minutes are past.

249
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,340
I had warned you.

250
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,080
I do not have more time to play with you.

251
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,050
Sand is quite dry today.

252
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,830
A tempête de sable!

253
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,640
In the sky, in the South!

254
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,430
Evacuate!

255
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,540
Wait! The wind blows towards the South!

256
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,060
It should avoid us!

257
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,920
Colonel Smoker!

258
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,050
It is…!?

259
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,720
Vivi! Doesn't something go?

260
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,270
There is a tempête de sable above Rainbase!

261
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,020
It is him…

262
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,130
Luffy…

263
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,360
Listen, Luffy with the straw hat.

264
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,630
Here the dominant winds always blow of North towards the South.

265
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,440
If…

266
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,400
… this small tempête de sable moves towards the South and grows bigger,

267
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,930
where do you think that it will strike when it will be beautiful and large?

268
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,600
Towards the South?

269
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,670
In Yuba.

270
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,020
Why!?

271
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,500
You! Why do you do that!?

272
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,650
Stop that!

273
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,460
Look at, a breeze of wind coming from the South rose…

274
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,130
Ossan does not have anything to see in it!

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,960
Dirtiness!

276
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,280
DECREE, DIRTINESS!

277
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,300
DECREE! FILTH!

278
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
DECREE!!

279
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,830
It is useless.
Drop.

280
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,280
Once this storm took speed,

281
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,090
even me, I would be unable to stop it.

282
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,860
Stop of you foutre of me!

283
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,100
Yuba is finished.

284
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,160
Stop it! Immediately!

285
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,540
For which take to me you?

286
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,300
Beginners who only make tell it like you…

287
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,950
there is full.

288
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,940
Luffy with the straw hat.

289
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,460
Here on Large Line…

1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Say a spell in your chest

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,829
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,670
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

18
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,600
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

19
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,119
Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,589
Negai nara chiisana mune no naka

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,480
Kibou de jumon o

22
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,700
Kakereba...

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,599
Kasoku shita yokan

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,830
Nanairo no onpukana de

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,859
Issho ni konai ka?

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,689
Bokura datenshi

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,760
Yume ni ya o hanatsu no sa

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,649
Kobaruto buruu ni

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,840
Naniiro o kasanete ikou?

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,869
Hitomi ni utsutta kanashii riaru o kowase

Nukumori tsuki no hane o ageyou

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,749
Shuuru na datenshi

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,990
Kokoro kara utau no sa

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,919
Wealth.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,159
Fame.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,179
Power.

37
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,930
The man who once owned everything,

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,109
The Pirate King,

39
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,810
Gold Roger.

40
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,439
The words he said before his death

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,349
sent all the people of the world

42
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,270
out to the seas.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,749
My treasure?

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,539
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

45
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,239
Find it!

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
I left everything in that place.

47
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,889
Men, searching for romance,

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,210
pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,609
The world is now

50
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,340
in the Grand Age of Pirates!

51
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,549
Chopper!

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,759
What's wrong?

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,629
Look closely, it's me!

54
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,420
Nami!

55
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,650
Chopper!

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,820
Chopper, stop it!

57
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,669
It's time for me to finish this.

58
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,820
Rankyaku: Storm leg

59
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,399
No!

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,920
I can't dodge when my whole body's like this!

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,740
I dodged?

62
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,249
One of my legs is back to normal!

63
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,390
Why?

64
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,610
What happened?

65
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,859
It's wet...

66
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,770
In all the confusion before... Yes!

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,129
Water!

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,770
The soap power can be washed away with water!

69
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,590
Aren't you underestimating me?

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,369
Golden awa: Golden bubbles, as well as "awa" being a pun with "hour"

71
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,640
Do you really think I'll let you do it?

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,130
Hitsuji-Gumo Relax Awa: Sheep-cloud relax bubbles, as well as "awa" being a pun with "hour"

73
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,390
I'll blow those bubbles away with wind!

74
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,190
Cyclone-

75
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,210
Damn!

76
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,870
No, my strength is...

77
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,700
Shinaru Shigan: Bending finger gun

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,359
The Tact...

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,150
Whip!

80
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,329
I'm saved...

81
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,600
Saved?

82
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,930
When you send me flying,

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,100
You also get rid of the other bubbles.

84
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,239
If you like,

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,570
I can continue to send you flying until you die.

86
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,259
The weather is cloudy!

87
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,230
Cloudy Tempo!

88
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,710
It's not a magic show like it used to be!

89
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,960
Clouds... More lightning?

90
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,309
Lightning doesn't come from thin clouds like this.

91
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,310
Instead, they'll do something else.

92
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,350
You wouldn't... No, you would!

93
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,569
The weather is rainy!

94
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,589
Cool Ball!

95
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,480
Soru: Shave

96
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,520
Rain!

97
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,770
Rain Tempo!

98
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,660
That's not very nice, after I'd made you so beautiful.

99
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,040
If giving in is nice, then I have to refuse.

100
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,740
Cool Charge!

101
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,270
Mirage Tempo!

102
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,999
She's gone?

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,940
I understand your powers,

104
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,650
And CP9's strength.

105
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,770
What is this?

106
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,780
Mirage Tempo

107
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,760
Fata Morgana!

108
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,860
Nami's Determination!

109
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,360
Shoot the Rampaging Chopper!

110
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,800
The mirages from before... only one is real?

111
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,909
That's right.

112
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,739
One is me, the others are just distortions caused by the extreme cold,

113
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,270
Illusions in the air itself.

114
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,199
Illusions?

115
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,840
How mysterious and beautiful.

116
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,020
But if you think about it, you'll realize that illusions cannot be hurt by attacks.

117
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,089
So, the entire point of this is to mislead me.

118
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,370
Exactly.

119
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,760
Getting this serious...

120
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,289
That's not cute at all.

121
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,580
Thunder Charge.

122
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,420
The real one of me is among these five.

123
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,380
So what?

124
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,830
So...

125
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,340
Thunder Ball!

126
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,679
Only 20% of these attacks are real.

127
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,890
Can you dodge them?

128
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,009
No... I have to guard!

129
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,750
What are you-

130
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,779
But that was 100% of the power.

131
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,869
Didn't I tell you?

132
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,570
You're too careless.

133
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,679
The Clima Tact is a lot different from before.

134
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,330
This much power in a simple Thunder Ball...

135
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,800
With my next big attack, I'll defeat you.

136
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,750
Why are you making promises like that?

137
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,760
You're too cocky!

138
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,239
It's not a promise.

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,459
It's a forecast.

140
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,739
I have control over the humidity and temperature.

141
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,520
The weather in this room is all mine!

142
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,989
Why does it matter if you've controlled the weather?

143
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,890
The rokushiki surpass any human abilities!

144
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,020
Insolent girl!

145
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,360
That one wasn't real?!

146
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,499
The probability of finding the real one...

147
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,070
Is 20%.

148
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,160
In today's sky...

149
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,539
In a field of stable pressure...

150
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,279
There will be violent currents, and some storm clouds.

151
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,500
Soon, the lightning and thunder may even pierce your chest.

152
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,180
Be careful of the numbness of the heart!

153
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,390
Dark Cloud Tempo!

154
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,019
I showed you before how I can guard against lightning.

155
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,600
I just have to be prepared!

156
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,680
When you guard like that, you have the disadvantage of being unable to move.

157
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,479
Don't underestimate me.

158
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,449
Are you saying that you can defeat that with a simple attack?

159
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,620
Well.

160
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,580
Soap Sheep!

161
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,819
I don't need to only hit the real one.

162
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,630
I'll simply engulf all of you with a wave of "relax awa!"

163
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,670
Hitsuji-Gumo Tidal Wave!

164
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,309
If that hits me, it's all over!

165
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,390
All that will be truely engulfed is the real one!

166
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,150
You think I'll let that happen?

167
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,570
Cyclone Tempo!

168
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,780
Blowing them away with wind...!

169
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,049
But the one that was saved...

170
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,640
Must be the real one!

171
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,390
Shigan!

172
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,650
Oh, I thought you were an illusion as well.

173
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,159
You can't escape any longer.

174
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,360
I'll cover you in holes.

175
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,290
Did you forget?

176
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,250
You need to listen to a navigator's weather forecast.

177
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,010
Lightning will come forth from the storm cloud to the Clima Tact.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,730
Come!

179
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,290
The one from before...

180
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,390
Thunder Lance Tempo!

181
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,669
No matter how strong you are,

182
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,160
My forecasts are always right.

183
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,279
My nakama are waiting.

184
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,030
I'm taking your key!

185
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,219
Bastard...

186
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,320
Damn deer-gorilla...

187
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,320
This whole island's in trouble!

188
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,480
Everybody... you'd better be safe!

189
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,440
Oi, marines, come back!

190
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,400
Come back for us!

191
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,740
Amanedachi: Circumference cut

192
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,570
Chopper, aren't you done?!

193
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,700
What're you doing?

194
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,270
Wait, Nico Robin!

195
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,370
Made it!

196
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,709
Deer-gorilla!

197
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,080
Where are you?

198
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,369
Franky?

199
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,869
Why were you there?

200
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,130
Oneechan: Girly

201
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,879
That deer-gorilla of yours came this way, right?

202
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,029
Deer...? Chopper?

203
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,249
Yeah, the deer-gorilla.

204
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,469
Yes, he did!

205
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,819
What was that?

206
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,479
What happened to Chopper?!

207
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,109
How would I know?

208
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,349
I was gonna ask you!

209
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,160
Can't he change into that kinda thing?

210
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,439
I don't know, I've never seen him like that before!

211
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,149
Really?

212
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,110
I thought you guys would know how to deal with him...

213
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,110
Well, let's just go kill him then...

214
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,729
If you say that again... I'll be the one to kill you!

215
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,660
I-I won't say it again... Never again.

216
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,119
But anyway, if we don't do anything,

217
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,260
And we just let him rampage like that...

218
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,500
We don't know what'll happen to this tower.

219
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,539
Yeah...

220
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,400
It doesn't seem like he'll listen to us...

221
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,539
And he didn't even seem to recognize me.

222
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,169
He might have lost his memories.

223
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,150
What caused this?

224
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,069
I'm not sure, but it probably has something to do with his devil fruit.

225
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,700
Then there'll only be one way to deal with it...

226
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,149
Anyway, good job!

227
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,889
You took this woman out?

228
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,319
We need the key she had, the number two key.

229
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,839
The key? Just a sec, I was just looking for it.

230
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,370
Key, key... Where did she hide it?

231
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,590
Now that's great.

232
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,060
Stay away, stay away!

233
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,529
You know, I have 8000 men who will...

234
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,019
Actually, they're my friend Usopp-kun's.

235
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,630
But anyway, they're gonna attack this island, so please just stop this and get away!

236
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,129
Aren't there more than 8000 men on this island?

237
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,320
Go ahead and call 'em.

238
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,839
Fool, don't say things like that.

239
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,299
If you fall for this fool's lies, you're a disgrace to CP9.

240
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,789
I know, I was just playing along with the lie.

241
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,829
It's not like I'm lacking in common sense like you seem to be.

242
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,469
I have a lot of common sense!

243
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,890
I'm just saying you do idiotic things, stupid-eyelashes!

244
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,540
Let's change our plan.

245
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,259
But for now...

246
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,860
The Buster Call's coming.

247
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,329
We've wasted a lot of time,

248
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,780
So it's time to just work together.

249
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,370
Let's finish this!

250
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,039
W-wait, calm down!

251
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,460
You calm down!

252
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,420
Rankyaku!

253
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,750
Shigan!

254
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,220
Shigan!

255
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,720
You can't let yourself drop it, be more careful!

256
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,190
Soru!

257
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,299
This is dangerous, it'd be best if we could detach ourselves safely.

258
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,259
I want to get this guy off of me.

259
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,030
Chopper! Hurry and save us!

260
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,390
What's that monster?

261
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,939
There was another zoan fruit user?

262
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,439
This guy's CP9 too?

263
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,790
But he seems familiar.

264
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,500
Ch-Chopper?!

265
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,260
Chopper, it's us!

266
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,020
Stop it!

267
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,139
Oi, is that thing really Chopper?

268
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,699
Why the hell doesn't he recognize us?!

269
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,219
I don't know, but it has to be Chopper!

270
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,320
There isn't anything else with that hat and those horns!

271
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,539
Then, what about our hope?

272
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,689
The number two key?

273
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,790
I don't know, we're done for, we're gonna die...

274
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,790
But it's strange...

275
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,250
He's the one that looks close to death.

276
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
His life force is draining really fast.

277
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,189
W-what are you talking about?

278
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,880
It's like just being in that form uses a huge amount of energy...

279
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,319
What?! What can we do about it?

280
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,019
What about the key?!

281
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,729
Where's the number two key?!

282
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,540
I don't know what happened,

283
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,760
But he probably fought as hard as he could,

284
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,919
And he turned into that.

285
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,190
And now...

286
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,949
He's causing a lot of problems...

287
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,089
What is that creature?

288
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,569
And the Buster Call is still approaching...

289
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,160
He's annoying, so he's probably one of the pirates.

290
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,289
If it's in the way,

291
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,290
We need to get rid of it.

292
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,369
He's weak, but

293
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,540
We get something this way.

294
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,789
They're gonna get Chopper!

295
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,790
Straighten your back, Hana-Arashi!

296
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,029
What are you doing?!

297
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,730
Sanjuuroku Pondo Hou: 36 pound cannon

298
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,520
Bastard...

299
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,079
Outta the way, you guys!

300
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,280
He's-

301
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,559
Franky!

302
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,189
What the hell're you trying to do, these guys are our-

303
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,380
I know, shut up.

304
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,009
This is the only solution.

305
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,299
Devil fruit users have one weakness...

306
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,469
I'll shoot him into the sea

307
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,840
Sorry, but this is what I have to do!

308
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,890
Coup de Vent: Strong gale

309
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,019
Franky, you bastard, what the hell're you doing,

310
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,780
You can't do that kinda thing to our nakama!

311
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,759
Don't worry.

312
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,910
We already worked it out together.

313
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,559
Doing that kinda thing...

314
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,609
What the hell are they trying to do?

315
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,550
What an annoying group...

316
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,070
You're finally free?

317
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,480
Don't laugh, you should be regretful.

318
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,840
A chance to kill me like you could before will never come again.

319
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,770
World Government!

320
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,069
Please!

321
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,179
Don't kill Usopp!

322
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,359
You're next!

323
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,809
Stop!

324
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,100
Next time on One Piece:

325
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,760
Introducing Sanji the Hunter?

326
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,919
An Elegy for the Lying Wolf

327
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,320
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

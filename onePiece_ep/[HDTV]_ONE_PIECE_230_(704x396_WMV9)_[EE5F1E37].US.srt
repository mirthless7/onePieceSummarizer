1
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Then now, where please go itself?

2
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,150
We have a boat, we cannot travel by the train…

3
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,579
We follow the log poses.

4
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,099
I see, therefore you move towards Water Seven?

5
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,569
Seven toilets?

6
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,669
Better of all, it is a city filled with shipyards.

7
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,000
The carpenters are most qualified there of the world.

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,009
Well! It is decided!

9
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,450
We will go over there and definitively recruit a carpenter for the crew!

10
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,200
Waouuuuh! It is what that?

11
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,080
Hummm… That should be a place on by here.

12
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,440
Wah, I will not have believed that.

13
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,519
Is Going Merry damaged as well as that?

14
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,760
Take this.

15
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,930
A chart?

16
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,730
This will be useful to us, thank you.

17
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,139
Excel. We can thus go to the shipyard after having made the exchange.

18
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,949
Yes. Finally, us will be able to repair Going Merry.

19
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,650
Well! Go, will yagara!

20
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,450
Return, and made attention!

21
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,180
Go, press towards the shipyard! Yahooooo!

22
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:18,890
The adventure in quotes of water!
Victoire for the giant shipyard

23
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,150
It is formidable.

24
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,680
Eh, I count on you.

25
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,949
These will yagaras are so convenient!

26
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,650
They are not balanced either, it is comfortable!

27
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,489
Course far, course!

28
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,589
It went by!

29
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,499
It comes by here.

30
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,760
Doge!

31
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,960
Idiot!

32
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,260
Cool!

33
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,650
This place resembles a residential district.

34
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,880
These channels are really the core of the city.

35
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,589
Eh Year-chan.

36
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,110
Ah Ossan!

37
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,660
Where go?

38
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,089
The tourist visit?

39
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,630
We move towards the shipyard to make repair our boat!

40
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,349
Then, first of all, direct towards the market in the open air.

41
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,799
Échec et mat.

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,060
Thank you!

43
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,800
The market in the open air…

44
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,020
Towards the line starting from this point.

45
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,389
Oh, my pretty Miss!

46
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,050
What would say to be dined with me this evening?

47
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,150
You do not occupy of him! It is right the manner of greeting certain men here!

48
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,749
Eh, darling, dispatch you to go to work.

49
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,400
I know, you are so strong…

50
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,849
In any event, this city is really liberal and excessively friendly with the foreigners.

51
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,580
Ehh! Length-nose!

52
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,450
Nothing, I just wanted to joke with you!

53
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,810
I will strike you, ossan!

54
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,950
Ah, they are the stiff ways.

55
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,410
The current is against us. Can they assemble that?

56
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,089
Bad way! It is on the right! ON THE RIGHT!

57
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,400
It is not card-indexed badly that the current is against us.

58
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,520
It is really strong!

59
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,400
Yihoo! There are channels above the roofs, too!

60
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,199
It is the bad way!  We must go to the market initially!

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,409
Would not be so in a hurry!

62
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,910
Since we came up to now, let us assemble this channel!

63
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,759
Eh… Eh! Look at… Look IN FRONT OF US!

64
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,210
Ah. .ah! It is well, we are all in top now!

65
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,150
That means…

66
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,739
Yihou!

67
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,929
It is amusing.

68
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,750
No… Not, that is not it.

69
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,850
Forgiveness

70
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,149
Us… We fly.

71
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,200
We are in the train of tomb… falling… to fall… Tom…

72
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,070
WE ARE IN THE TRAIN OF TOMBEEEERR!!

73
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,190
Do not believe to have made so well!

74
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,260
Oh! They is cheap!

75
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,579
In do you want?

76
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,610
Come there! Now!

77
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,940
It is rare to see a collection of pin's of this type.

78
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,580
It is now that starts the fair “All to 5”!

79
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,009
Wooo! It is very animated now!

80
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,610
Hein? We found the market.

81
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,210
Perhaps what it was a short cut?

82
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,119
Forgiveness! You are really very intelligent!

83
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,169
I never saw a market as animated as this one.

84
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,650
Eh! Look at!

85
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,449
Which enormous will yagara.

86
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,540
Ooo! It comes by here!

87
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,639
It is really alarming!

88
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,769
We could eat it.

89
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,080
Is this a form “King”?

90
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,520
Hein? Is qu. .qu' what it is?

91
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,790
Masks?

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,679
Ehh, it is pretty! They are splendid.

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,220
There is a festival?

94
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,100
What is what does not go?

95
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,650
Mizu-mizu:Toilet-toilets [Wet, full of water]

96
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,139
Mizu-mizu:Toilet-toilets [Wet, full of water]

97
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,740
What delights! Yagara, goes over there!

98
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,370
What?! Eh, where do you go?

99
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,839
Eh Luffy! Where do you go?

100
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Ask Yagara!

101
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,569
Welcome, which is what you will give pleasure?

102
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,130
I see, you are hungry.

103
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,989
Mizu Mizu:Toilet-toilets [Wet, full of water]

104
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,510
Mizu-mizu?! Put to me of ten!

105
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,829
The chiefs of the island of the gourmet come on this market to buy our dishes.

106
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,210
Do your body and your heart slacken, not?

107
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,059
Trooooooooooooop Cooooooooooool!

108
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,149
Delicious!

109
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,210
Euh? They is good? Oi, Luffy, give me of one!

110
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,770
It is with me! Will buy some to you!

111
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,100
Oi Nami! Let us go towards the stands!

112
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,820
Still one by here!

113
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,019
If one looks at around, there is everywhere!

114
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,090
Nami!

115
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,290
They are masked people…

116
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,830
Oi! Nami!

117
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,519
Oi! Pirates make grabuge with the Dock n° 1

118
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,120
It is true?

119
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,870
Ah! Allons-y quickly!

120
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,210
A room V.I.P? I do not include/understand.

121
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,330
Not, not, it is not that.

122
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,469
I thought of this.

123
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:08,870
Yes, you repaired our boat well but I think that the price is too high.

124
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,880
You obstruct our work.

125
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,220
I thus finally decided not to pay only one berry.

126
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,670
Thank you for these good repairs!

127
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,650
And for nothing, moreover!

128
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,979
Humm. Is Kalifa, it what that?

129
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,320
Ah, yes, Iceberg-san.

130
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,620
They are the customers of the Dock n° 1, they said to me that they refuse to pay.

131
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,260
It is an aggravating man.

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
Hum, an aggravating customer…

133
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,310
Customers, you would have cease making fun you of the carpenters.

134
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,089
Ca-captain!!

135
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,700
Captain!!

136
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,580
Aoh, sorry.

137
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,920
That is to say cursed! Look at what you did!

138
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,269
Ah…. Excuse me.

139
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,199
Do you want really to beat you against us?

140
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,060
Who do you think that we are?

141
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,599
Oi! Did you test if this gun works correctly?

142
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,430
Not, not yet.

143
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,250
Shit! Who you êtez?!

144
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,820
You will not draw any like that!

145
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,540
In the carpenters, the pirates cannot impose their rules.

146
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,969
We are here, then we will enter finally the island of naval construction

147
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,800
With the water elevator.

148
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,279
Water elevator?

149
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,160
I believe that it is this tower.

150
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,030
Please, enter!

151
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,720
The elevator leads to the island of naval construction

152
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Where the shipyard so famous is that it is also the center of the districts of Seven Toilets!

153
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,150
Please, dispatch to enter itself the conveyer, one minute before the closing of the doors.

154
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,690
What T will it occur in it?

155
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,710
Oh! The conveyer closed himself.

156
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,330
We are going up, to go up in top!

157
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,339
I see.

158
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,830
We enter, the whole is closed and of water arrives and propels us in top.

159
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,210
Water Seven is so interesting!

160
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,810
They can do anything with water.

161
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,050
Oi!

162
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,140
It is which it alga?

163
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,720
Oi Zoro!

164
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,380
Where is Robin-chan? It is not there.

165
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,120
Ouais, it is not there. It went to visit the city with Chopper a small moment.

166
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,210
What?

167
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,270
They said that they wanted to make some purchases.

168
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,300
What a hell! Then you are only on the boat?

169
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,330
What a tedious situation!

170
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
I am of agreement…

171
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,260
Yosh! I also will make some races and will trott me.

172
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,340
Esseyes to keep the boat in good condition.

173
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,550
He sleeps all the time…

174
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,220
Okay!

175
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,640
I count on you.

176
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,530
We are there!!

177
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,220
They are high the districts of Seven Toilets, where is the best shipyard of the world?

178
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,480
As I suspected it, there is more ground by here.

179
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,950
All is so large!

180
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,910
I never saw such an enormous city!

181
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,670
The fountain which appeared tiny to us by far is so gigantic.

182
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,640
T why there it has an assembly?

183
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,969
Do they look at the shipyard?

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,730

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,859

190
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,550
Hey, Ossan.

191
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,700
What did it occur?

192
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,850
Yes… of the pirates still assembled themselves in the Dock n°1.

193
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,599
But, as everyone expected it, the pirates were made amocher by the carpenters.

194
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,860
The idiots did not finish their procession.

195
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,309
Thus these carpenters can beat pirates.

196
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,490
Ah! You must be a traveller.

197
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,450
This crowd is there to admire!

198
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:11,970
Those which do not live by here come to see the exploits of Galley it Compagnie.

199
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,020
They are strong, they are qualified.

200
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,870
They are the pride of Seven Toilets!

201
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,090

202
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,200

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,930
We will be able to return later.

205
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,600
It is the market in the open air.

206
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,650
Not only it is animated, but that remains also a street.

207
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,810
There are malls too.

208
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,930
There are water and pretty streets.

209
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,850
Effrayannnnt!

210
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,569
A super beautiful woman!

211
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,280
In hundred years, it is the first time that I see if beautiful woman.

212
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,330
There are tons of Sanji.

213
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,980
It is what?

214
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,540
It is a shop of masks.

215
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,580
People around us carried from there.

216
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,940
Then they thus carried masks? I thought that they had odd heads.

217
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,979
In one of the cities where Umi Ressha passes, San Faldo.

218
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,750
They make a long dressed up carnival.

219
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,639
How do you know that?

220
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,880
Because people in the street were speaking about it.

221
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,710
How can you hear them?

222
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,830
A practice.

223
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,820
Since I am child, I learned has to read the expressions of people and to listen espièglement.

224
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,640
You are astonishing, Robin!

225
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,250
Doctor

226
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,939
There is a bookstore by here.

227
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,800

228
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,240

229
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,430

237
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,880

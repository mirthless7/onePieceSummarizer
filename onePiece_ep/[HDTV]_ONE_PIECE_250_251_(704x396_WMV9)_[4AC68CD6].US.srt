1
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,258
Dumb!

2
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,591
Now we know the true one
identity of the members of the CP9

3
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:29,325
Lucci, Kaku, Bluen, Kalfifa.

4
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:33,257
Luffy and Zoro were opposed to them…

5
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:37,258
but they were beaten by Lucci which
have the capacity of the fruit Neko Neko.

6
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:45,457
The CP9 discovered that Franky is actually Cutty Flam and that it has the plan of the old weapon, Pluton.

7
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,725
I do not have anything to give you!

8
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:58,591
Following a short combat, they succeeded in putting
the hand on Franky, which had been opposed to them.

9
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,258
They smashed me well.

10
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:07,325
I will make him pay that!

11
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,591
We will leave only after having recovered
what we came to seek…

12
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:12,724
Engineer Cutty Flam.

13
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,391
The plans are not here!

14
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:23,725
Afflicted.

15
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:43,525
Where am I?

16
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,057
Shit! Why does that arrive only at me?

17
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:51,458
Whore! Is necessary that I draw from there!

18
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,925
They is good, I am there almost.

19
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,725
The government handled us…

20
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,858
They will make us take the responsibility
of this attack.

21
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,525
They want the plan…

22
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:31,858
then they will treat Tom-san like a criminal.

23
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:36,325
And you oses still to say that you do not have nothing to do there?!

24
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:40,325
So because of that Tom-san is made stop…

25
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:46,458
I WILL FORGIVE IT TO YOU, NEVER! FRANKY!

26
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:52,600
I would never have…

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,857
STOP!

28
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,125
Tom-san!

29
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:58,824
One should not be upset with him, Iceberg.

30
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,925
Franky did not do anything of evil.

31
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,591
Even now you continue to defend it!?

32
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,325
Tom-san!

33
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,991
I is sorry, it is one of the harpoons which I manufactured.

34
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:12,925
I manufactured them so as to it
that one doesnot can withdraw them.

35
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,325
Whore!

36
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:19,957
Do not excuse you, that does not even make me badly.

37
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,857
Look by here!

38
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,290
Tom is with ground!

39
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,090
Why it is so seriously wounded?!

40
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,125
This is due to the attack?!

41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,925
Inhabitants of the city…

42
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,990
Eh well now Sirs…

43
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:38,924
if we went downtown?!

44
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:40,724
Dumb! Spanda!

45
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,791
It is Spandam!

46
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:46,125
My dear criminals.

47
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:54,700
Last breath Of a MAN the ÉGENDAIRE!
The DAY OR UMI RESSHA IS AFFLICTED

48
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,691
Here those which attacked the city!

49
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:01,424
You reassure!

50
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:05,758
We, the CP5, destroyed the boats
accused in the attack!

51
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,291
They do not have nowhere where to go!

52
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:11,490
It had just to await the lawsuit to be cleared.

53
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,890
Why Tom did it do that?

54
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:17,158
It was only one combined of the Lord of the Pirates after all.

55
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,291
Charmed to make your knowledge.

56
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,290
I belong to the CP5, my name is Spandam.

57
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,957
Fortunately that you were by here.

58
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,224
You saved us.

59
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:28,524
Do I can have their guard?

60
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,758
I would like to question them.

61
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:37,057
thus try you to leave there now,
nobody any more will believe you.

62
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:41,225
The plan of the old weapon goes soon
to belong to me to me Spandam!

63
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,025
How all that did can arrive?

64
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,357
First of all I congratulate you concerning Umi Ressha.

65
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:56,157
From today, it will contribute
enormously in the growth of Seven Toilets.

66
00:06:56,158 --> 00:07:01,290
Then, with regard to your implication in
the construction of the boat pirates of Gold Roger…

67
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:07,824
we went you gracier and rising the sorrow which then weighed on you why thus to have made another crime?

68
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,124
Your mouths!

69
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,024
We did not attack the naval Court of Assizes!

70
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:15,358
It is this cretin of Spandam the person in charge!

71
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,424
Anything!

72
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:27,158
What it tells the apprentice of Tom!

73
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:32,691
The CP5 would not have anything to gain in
running the naval Court of Assizes.

74
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:36,025
It is unthinkable, they are that conneries!

75
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,357
You Cutty Flam, isn't this names themselves?

76
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:46,157
You were stopped on the scene of the crime,
in the middle of the accused boats…

77
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:52,025
Moreover, these ships do not have all
summer created by your company?!

78
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,091
The boats which make this type of things…

79
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:05,291
are not…

80
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,425
more my boats!

81
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,291
Tom pulverized his shackles!

82
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:20,690
Out of cheek!

83
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:21,825
Out of cheek!

84
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,958
Tom-san. It is the first time that it strikes Franky.

85
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,025
What takes to you?!

86
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:36,691
“They are not any more my boats”, not truth?!

87
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,425
You should never say that!

88
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,025
Why I could not?!
I regret having done them!

89
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,491
If I had not built these boats,
there no would have been casualties.

90
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:52,158
It does not matter the boat…

91
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,358
that one builds…

92
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:59,091
It is neither good, nor malicious.

93
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:03,825
It does not matter what you will build in the future.

94
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:04,891
But…

95
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:09,758
Knows that it does not matter that your boats wound
people, or even as they destroy the world.

96
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:13,891
That which builds a boat must
to like more than no matter whom.

97
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:17,424
That which built it should not disavow it.

98
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,290
Do not reject the fault on your boats!

99
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,225
A MAN MUST BE PROUD…

100
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:24,158
BOATS WHICH IT BUILDS!

101
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:44,758
Iceberg.

102
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,491
Franky.

103
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,758
You do not interfere what will occur now.

104
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,958
Though it arrives.

105
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,424
The world government orchestrated this crime…

106
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,624
And now it will show me.

107
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,425
The situation is irreversible now.

108
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,026
It is finished

109
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:09,691
That they make use of your boats in manner
also wretched, that has of you to wound and…

110
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,025
you wanted to strike it, is not this Franky

111
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,625
Tom-san!

112
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,558
Tom became insane!

113
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,624
It is impossible!

114
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,824
Stop!

115
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:31,758
If you continue…

116
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,958
…

117
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:38,757
you include/understand his pain?!

118
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,025
FIRE!!

119
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:46,025
They drew.

120
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,825
TOM-SAN!

121
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:03,890
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

122
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:11,358
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

123
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,491
TOM-SAN!

124
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,025
Tranquillizing.

125
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,358
You deserved it well, dirtiness of poiscaille!

126
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,491
Tom-san! Why you did that?!

127
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,557
What you foutez?!

128
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,491
Catch to them all!

129
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:40,124
Take along all the members of
Tom' S Workers in Enies Lobby!

130
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,757
I would never have imagined
how Tom was also dangerous!

131
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,758
But what it took to him?!

132
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:49,225
I knew, it is to it an ally of the pirates!

133
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:53,292
It built all these warships to this end!

134
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,624
Bandage dumbs, do not speak like that about Tom-san!

135
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,958
Stop!

136
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,224
That will go.

137
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,358
But!

138
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:01,825
Your Honor.

139
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:07,292
I am guilty crime to have
attacked the naval Court of Assizes.

140
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,492
Wait! Tom-san! Not that!

141
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,557
But I have a request…

142
00:12:12,558 --> 00:12:14,424
Your mouth, salts poiscaille!

143
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,891
The criminals as you do not have anything to claim!

144
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,025
You, CP5 conceal!

145
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,091
I listen to your request, then?

146
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:26,492
If the creation of Umi Ressha can
to cancel one of my crimes…

147
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,292
Then cancel the crime of today.

148
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:35,024
Even if I accept your request,
that would do for nothing but bring back us behind.

149
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:40,691
You would be always guilty to have created
the ship of the Lord of the Pirates.

150
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,358
Yes, it is very well like that!

151
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:47,025
The fact of having helped this man named Roger…

152
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,692
RETURNS TO ME VERY PROUD!

153
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,057
Which horror.

154
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,358
He is proud to have helped the Lord of the Pirates.

155
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:58,624
Species of traitor!

156
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,292
Dirtiness of poiscaille!

157
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,424
Tom-san!

158
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:03,624
Why?!

159
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,492
It is very well like that.

160
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:09,092
You do not have anything to reproach yourself.

161
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:13,958
I did not think only the government
in would have after the plans at this point…

162
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,824
The fact of having worked with Roger
did nothing but worsen the things.

163
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,824
But why all take on you?!

164
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,492
They is good.

165
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:25,224
Look at. Even if my sentence
is the same one as 14 years ago.

166
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:27,491
This time all is different…

167
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:30,758
because this city is full with life.

168
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:33,892
From now…

169
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:37,225
it does not matter what arrives to me…

170
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,825
because I was able to help this city.

171
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:43,025
My dream…

172
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:47,825
finally took its take-off.

173
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,292
Tom-san!

174
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,492
Tom-san!

175
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:02,092
Iceberg, Franky…

176
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,292
Take care of these plans.

177
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,425
Kokoro-san, Yokozuna…

178
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,425
Thank you to have taken care of me.

179
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,357
Tranquillizing finally started to act.

180
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,891
Stop these three men who have
attacked naval Court of Assizes!

181
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:21,825
Yes!

182
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:24,625
Wait!

183
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:27,625
The charges changed.

184
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:32,291
For the crime to have created the boat of
Lord of the Pirates, Gold Roger…

185
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:36,825
I condemn engineer Tom,
with being taken along to Enies Lobby.

186
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,158
It will be all.

187
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:44,291
Old cretin, I do not know what you ace…

188
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,891
In any event the apprentices are not useful to me with nothing.

189
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:49,158
Slacken these two apprentices!

190
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,092
Tom-san cannot be saved any more.

191
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,557
Vis-a-vis the World Government…

192
00:15:00,558 --> 00:15:02,291
one can nothing make!

193
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,824
Hold good.

194
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:06,825
Tom-san saved you the life.

195
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:11,692
Then do not waste it while fighting face
with them, you will never gain.

196
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:15,624
Enies Lobby is the island of the government
where the judgments take place.

197
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:21,625
Nobody succeeded in leaving there!

198
00:15:22,558 --> 00:15:24,891
Umi Ressha is avoided to leave!

199
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,291
We can go there, Mister!

200
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,357
Well!

201
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,958
Kokoro-san.

202
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,025
Take along to it the guy!

203
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,226
I…

204
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,224
Let us bring back this dirtiness of large cow!

205
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:40,825
I cannot retain myself any more!

206
00:15:50,758 --> 00:15:52,625
STOP!!!

207
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,692
Spandam-san has the face very twisted!

208
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,892
Maintaining it is the apprentice of Tom who pété a cable!

209
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:05,758
Stop that!

210
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,691
Capture it!

211
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,624
One takes it along to join Tom!

212
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,092
Come, I await you!

213
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:14,157
I will not let to you take it along!

214
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:15,825
Fire at will!

215
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,225
Release Tom-san!

216
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,892
You are well?!

217
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,158
Go ahead, course!

218
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,891
WHAT A DUMB!!

219
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,224
HE FLED!

220
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:45,824
This dirty idiot of Cutty Flam!
It will not draw any like that!

221
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:48,357
He also it is a criminal!

222
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:52,425
As soon as one finishes some with this business,
I go back there and I tankard this merdeux!

223
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,657
Spandam-san!

224
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:54,657
What?!

225
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:57,091
It is Cu… Cutty Flam!

226
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,424
How?!

227
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,091
It followed us up to now!

228
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:03,758
It is on the rails, it holds a kind of weapon!

229
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:10,292
Remain here, Yokozuna.

230
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:13,557
He is idiot or what?!

231
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,158
What does one make?

232
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,024
You to also be you too idiot!

233
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,491
One rolls to him above…

234
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:20,624
how he asks it!

235
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,024
That poses a problem to you?!

236
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,692
Of agreement.

237
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,625
Stop, Puffing Tom!

238
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:35,092
Where hope you to take along your creator?!

239
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,292
I will not leave myself it!

240
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,692
Return to me Tom-san!

241
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:04,092
Stop, Umi Ressha!

242
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:10,824
I see! Your parents gave up you!

243
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,425
The boob!

244
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,557
Hey, stops of you marrer!

245
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,225
Very well then, you can come at home!

246
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:18,626
Tom-san!

247
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,892
I do not want to build boats any more…

248
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:27,025
They could wound the people whom I love.

249
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:29,026
I do not want any more!

250
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,027
But, Tom-san…

251
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,228
You are…

252
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,825
what I always wanted to be!

253
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:48,292
I want that you returned to learn to me!

254
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:59,293
One day…

255
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:02,092
I will build the boat of my dreams!

256
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,793
The boat of my dreams…

257
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,058
who will be able to cross…

258
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,159
largest waves with pride!

259
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,358
And to make the round the world tour!

260
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:32,425
Called Tom for what one knows of him…

261
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:37,425
was a talented but unverifiable man
because of its man-fish force.

262
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:41,092
People from here do not manage to say clearly who it was.

263
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:46,558
It is a heavy task to defend
the name of its Master, Cutty Flam?

264
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:49,224
I do not even want to answer you…

265
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:52,692
You are only shits with the pay of the government!

266
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:53,824
Oï…

267
00:19:53,825 --> 00:20:00,558
This day, that which wounded a hundred soldiers of the navy and inhabitants of Seven Toilets…

268
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,292
It was you.

269
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,224
To attack a representative of the government
is a very serious crime, but…

270
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:11,891
one believed you dead, crushed by
Umi Ressha at the time of the accident…

271
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:14,092
then a withdrawal of case was marked.

272
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:19,025
As a former criminal,
you will be takes along to Enies Lobby.

273
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,625
And at this time, we will be able to take our time…

274
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,625
to question you and know where the plan of Pluto is.

275
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,357
Blueno.

276
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:33,692
Yes. That has been just connected.

277
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:42,257
When, I spoke about it with our chief…

278
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:46,024
he said to me that he wanted absolutely to speak you.

279
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,892
Your chief?

280
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:50,824
Please, chief.

281
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:55,625
That burns! Heat, heat!!
I reversed my coffee!

282
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,425
Shit, whore of coffee!

283
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,692
It is what that?

284
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:05,425
You are well there, Cutty Flam?

285
00:21:06,758 --> 00:21:09,292
That made a long time…

286
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:12,958
I did not think that you would have survived that.

287
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:18,092
I have evil to believe in it, but which good news…

288
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,957
Be to you which, you?

289
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,091
During these 8 last years…

290
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:28,492
I have mad not to be able to avenge me for
these wounds which make me so much suffer…

291
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:34,558
because the criminal who had inflicted them to me had died.

292
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:38,358
I You AI ASK WHICH You STAYS!

293
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,758
You do not remember…

294
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:49,157
8 years ago, I was the representative of the CP5…

295
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:54,958
that which had stopped Tom' S Workers
for the attack of the naval Court of Assizes.

296
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,725
Your chief

297
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,791
Please, chief.

298
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:33,258
That burns! Heat, Heat!!!

299
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,525
I reversed my coffee!

300
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:38,392
Shit, whore of coffee!

301
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,459
It is what that?

302
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,392
You are well there, Cutty Flam?

303
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,659
That made a long time.

304
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,592
I did not think that you would have survived that.

305
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:57,792
I have evil to believe in it, but which good news.

306
00:22:58,392 --> 00:23:01,059
Be to you which, you?

307
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:03,725
You do not remember?

308
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:08,950
8 years ago,
I was the representative of Cypher Pole N. 5…

309
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,392
that which had stopped Tom' S Workers
for the attack of the naval Court of Assizes.

310
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:19,324
It is you Spanda!

311
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:21,592
Dumb! It is SPANDAM!

312
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:28,059
I await impatiently your arrival with Enies Lobby.

313
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:33,392
The guy, bring to me this criminal, immediately!

314
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:38,791
That burns! That burns!

315
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,592
Foutue lamp!

316
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,458
Received.

317
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,725
*Katcha*

318
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,859
Let leave to me, whore!

319
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,460
One goes there.

320
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,991
DO NOT LEAVE SO QUICKLY!

321
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:07,525
RELEASE it!

322
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,125
All my excuses.

323
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:17,792
Oi! It WAS WHAT THIS MOMENT OF GLORY CAN!?

324
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:23,192
If I remember well, you are one
companion of the Straw hat.

325
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:13,492
THE TRUTH BEHIND TREASON!
DECISION DOULEUREUSE OF ROBIN!

326
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,259
The only task that it remains us today, it is
to prepare the train for people of the government.

327
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:25,191
It is not more badly seen that Aqua Laguna approaches.

328
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:30,058
The boat of this evening is a little special, it appears that there will be very important people on board.

329
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,592
How that?

330
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:35,591
I heard types of the Navy which spoke about it.

331
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:41,524
They said that there are people of very high-row
who carry out a secret mission in Water Seven,

332
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:43,658
under cover of anonymity.

333
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:44,991
A secret mission?

334
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:49,192
Yes, but I do not know what it acts exactly.

335
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,725
If they are under cover of anonymity,
it may be that we know them.

336
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:05,524
You know what? I have an little idea
of their true identity.

337
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:06,324
How?

338
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:07,392
Who that?

339
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:14,392
What? These types…

340
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:21,124
Sometimes they sometimes happen to them to discuss with the shelter
of all, very close to the bar of Blueno.

341
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,591
But good, suspecter just for that…

342
00:26:24,592 --> 00:26:30,191
But these goods with nothing crowned one
influence even if they do not foutent anything.

343
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:32,059
Hum, certainly.

344
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,458
There are many people which risk
to travel in first class.

345
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,592
Listen.

346
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:42,658
One will know their identity well when they
will join Umi Ressha.

347
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,459
Tomorrow, everyone will speak only about that downtown.

348
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,591
It is useless! The wind is too strong!

349
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:58,991
Fire does not weaken!

350
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,059
If there remain still people, one can nothing any more for them.

351
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,458
Iceberg-san!

352
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:21,725
Paulee-san!

353
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,726
Nami…

354
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:33,727
It is terrible…

355
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:35,728
It is necessary…

356
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:36,829
That I…

357
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,991
looks after…

358
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,725
quickly…

359
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:50,059
Dispatch you to look after them!

360
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,392
They are seriously flarings!

361
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:53,724
He, what one makes reindeer?!

362
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:56,124
Also take it along, it saved the life to them!

363
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,324
You ace reason.

364
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,859
Oï, give me a knack!

365
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:10,192
It was made beat.

366
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:20,192
You left the crew of the Straw hat,
but you did not give up piracy.

367
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,724
As you are a pirate, one will have to take you along with us.

368
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:24,524
Kalifa.

369
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:25,592
Yes.

370
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,925
And this ship…

371
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,525
It also will be necessary to get rid some.

372
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:37,592
He! Withdraw your legs from there!

373
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,859
What you made ace?

374
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,859
YOU HEAR Me!?

375
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:56,792
Even if it were only one cover, we were engineers completely qualified in this city.

376
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,659
Cease feeling sorry for you. When it is finished, it is finished.

377
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:09,224
AND THEN?!

378
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,458
COWARD the BUSINESS! It IS NOT YOUR BOAT!

379
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,692
With that, one must be able to evacuate water.

380
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,792
Wait! Do not make the idiot! He!

381
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:32,525
He! Stop!

382
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,626
All will be well…

383
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:50,959
I all will transport you still a little.

384
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:12,592
MERRY!!!

385
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:21,859
You move away!

386
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,660
That collapses!

387
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,459
Whore!

388
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:28,459
Cretin! Run away yourself!

389
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,325
One can nothing make.

390
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:49,992
Iceberg-san regains consciousness!

391
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:53,391
Really? It is brilliant!

392
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,125
Hurrah! It is alive!

393
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:57,525
Iceberg-san!

394
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:59,291
It is thanks to this reindeer!

395
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:02,859
But it appears that it is the animal of the Straw hat.

396
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:10,792
He, the girl regains consciousness!

397
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:15,524
What does one make?

398
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,059
One forces it to say to us where
find the Straw hat?!

399
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,991
But it is seriously wounded!

400
00:31:19,992 --> 00:31:21,058
And it is a woman.

401
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,525
Then one makes…

402
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:26,125
Iceberg-san, you should not move!

403
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,792
Please, leave us only a moment.

404
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,125
I want to only speak with only with it.

405
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:51,792
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

406
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:58,859
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

407
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,791
They speak about what?

408
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,059
No idea.

409
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,391
What takes to you?!

410
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,058
You move the bottom!

411
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,525
Lucci and the others are perhaps still inside!

412
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,925
Give us a knack, bandages morons!

413
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,592
It rightly. Oï!

414
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,459
Afflicted!

415
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:32,659
Nmaa~ First of all, I would like to excuse me…

416
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:35,824
to have shown to you wrongly…

417
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:37,859
I will make dissipate this misunderstanding.

418
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,392
It is in connection with Nico Robin.

419
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:44,725
You know something?

420
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,859
You oddly it acts that
since arrived in this city?

421
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,992
Yes, very of a blow.

422
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,092
It disappeared suddenly once arrived downtown.

423
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:59,259
The morning, it had tried to assassinate you.

424
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:06,592
One of our companions found it, but it him
said that it would not return any more among us.

425
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,191
We had not included/understood his reason…

426
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:14,992
and thus we came to see it this night for
he to ask why she wanted to leave the crew.

427
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:18,592
It is to carry out my dream.

428
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,192
Never it will be carried out if I remain with you.

429
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:28,259
Which is thus this dream which will not be carried out
not if it remains with us?

430
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,592
I will say to you what I know.

431
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:40,726
That was to be at the time when you had lost
of sight Nico Robin downtown for the first time.

432
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,726
CP9.

433
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,792
The plan of the government was already moving.

434
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,859
There is indeed a reason with its behavior.

435
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:58,791
But before that, knows that Nico Robin and me…

436
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:03,792
let us hold the capacity to destroy the world
by awaking an old weapon.

437
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,125
The world?

438
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,259
Indeed.

439
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:12,859
There is unforeseen in the course of the plan…

440
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:14,859
Everyone gathers in the room.

441
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:17,192
And do not draw on Iceberg.

442
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,592
You see, Nico Robin.

443
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:27,126
The plan that you recovered is a forgery.

444
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:34,392
I still prefer to die, rather than
to give the plan to the government.

445
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,091
In addition…

446
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:40,725
If you seek Ponéglyphes
and assistances the government…

447
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:43,792
I should stop you, here and now.

448
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:49,792
I do not seek Ponéglyphes
to awake the weapons.

449
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:53,059
However, I want to know the history.

450
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,926
That does not excuse anything!

451
00:34:58,192 --> 00:34:59,859
I repeated it…

452
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,326
still and still…

453
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:09,258
Even if you do not want it, the weapons
can wound no matter whom.

454
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:13,659
Even the people who are expensive to you!

455
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:18,926
Objects being able to wound others,
can always be used with an unhealthy aim.

456
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:24,459
If you intend to cause the destruction of the world
because of your desire for knowing the history…

457
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:27,792
then I must kill you here and now, Nico Robin!

458
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:34,526
You saw the destiny of the demons of Ohara and
however you want nevertheless to discover the history!?

459
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:38,059
WHAT YOU KNOW OHARA?!

460
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:47,392
You do not know the sorrows that I endured
in my life because of the world government!

461
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:53,792
Then why you help this government,
if you hate it as much as that?

462
00:35:59,526 --> 00:36:02,926
I have a dream to carry out whatever is the price.

463
00:36:08,926 --> 00:36:13,792
When I met the CP9 downtown,
they imposed two conditions to me…

464
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:18,992
To make show the crew of
Straw hat of your murder.

465
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:25,392
And then to follow the government and to obey to them.

466
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:28,659
They will carry out you right to dead…

467
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:33,192
Why a woman who has escaped during 20 years
with would the government accept these conditions?

468
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:38,191
The CP9 had the exceptional authorization…

469
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:42,059
to use Buster Cal against the Straw hat.

470
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:43,392
Buster cal?

471
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:50,726
It is an emergency procedure which gathers
5 vice-admirals like 10 warships…

472
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:58,192
Once one became the target of such an army,
it is possible no more no to escape from it.

473
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:06,059
Normally this capacity belongs only to
3 admirals and the admiral as a chief who directs the marine.

474
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:15,726
But the CP9 received from Ao Kiji the authorization
exceptional to use one of them.

475
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:20,859
If I refused their conditions, they would have
started Buster Cal against us.

476
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:24,259
By hearing the name of “Ao Kiji”,
I resigned myself to accept.

477
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:29,925
If I could survive these last years in
any conditions, it is because…

478
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:31,926
I did not have anybody to protect.

479
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,726
I could betray people and
to be used for to me about it to protect me.

480
00:37:36,526 --> 00:37:37,726
But…

481
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,526
Today I cannot any more do it.

482
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:46,192
They gave again me taste with the life,

483
00:37:46,492 --> 00:37:52,459
saved my heart and the dreams which I had lost.

484
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:57,592
I was made friends who believe in me.

485
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:03,459
But then n the other hand…

486
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:11,726
I could authorize the 6 members of the crew of
Mugiwara me excluded to leave this island alive!

487
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,192
And for that you are ready to awake the old ones
weapons with the risk to destroy the world?!

488
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:21,392
Completely.

489
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:29,792
Do not do anything!

490
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:39,926
I do not manage to press on the trigger…

491
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:59,392
In spite of all the human lives of this world…

492
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,926
it is you six whom it chose.

493
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:04,992
All that for us…

494
00:39:05,692 --> 00:39:12,326
Even if the plans of the weapon are on the point of
we to escape, I can nothing reproach him.

495
00:39:19,726 --> 00:39:21,259
Do He, what you have?

496
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:25,659
I am so happy…

497
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:30,326
Then Robin did not betray us.

498
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,326
I must gather everyone
and to inform some quickly!

499
00:39:35,326 --> 00:39:36,826
Thank you, Iceberg-san!

500
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:41,259
Wait! What do you intend to make?
The crew of Mugiwara is in crumbs!

501
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,559
What do we intend to make?

502
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:45,192
But it is now that all is played!

503
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:46,859
Luffy and the others do not die for if little.

504
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,859
They will not be let make!

505
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,659
From now, one will recover Robin.

506
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:54,259
The doubt and uncertainty weakened them…

507
00:39:55,992 --> 00:40:01,326
When they learn that one can save it,
their force will not know any limit!

508
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:06,092
Chopper!

509
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:07,626
Chopper!

510
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:10,058
Chopper! Upright!

511
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,591
One will seek the others!

512
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:12,859
Chopper! Hey! Upright! Chopper!

513
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:15,591
Oï, oï, it is seriously wounded!
Chopper! Hey! Upright! Chopper!

514
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:18,592
Upright! Chopper! Go!

515
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,526
Chopper…

516
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:25,458
Join Luffy and the others and tells them all.

517
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,591
Say to them all well.

518
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,126
And you, Sanji?

519
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:31,859
I will follow another plan.

520
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:34,859
Do not worry you, I will pay attention.

521
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,358
What doesn't go?

522
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,726
Does Robin really hate us?

523
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:49,659
Chopper…

524
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:53,592
Retain this well…

525
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:58,892
To forgive the lies of a woman…

526
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,159
it is the role of a man.

527
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:09,258
The special convoy will take
road with 23:00 for Enies Lobby…

528
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:15,526
Because of the rise of water, the loading
will be done starting from the second stage in the hall.

529
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,392
Yosh, let us see.

530
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,146
Due to secrecy defense, you are not
not authorized to see the passengers on board.

531
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,527
Good blood…

532
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:41,059
Finally, the woman who was
sought during 20 years went.

533
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,060
Bingo!

00:00:00,958 --> 00:00:08,225
The POLICE INTRIGUE OF the CHIEF
LUFFY WITH THE STRAW HAT

2
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:14,425
Here Large Jipangu.

3
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,425
It could resemble a region
having existed at a certain time…

4
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,357
But, let us pass the details for this time!

5
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:22,624
It is the special episode of end of the year after all!

6
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,025
Then… Here Large Jipangu.

7
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,158
Although it is the end of the year.
spring reigns on this region.

8
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:32,357
The season when the flowers of cherry trees open out.

9
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:39,091
This area is an haven of peace,
and the people enjoy happy days fully.

10
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:40,225
But…

11
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,024
Is all well, owner?

12
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,825
Here what arrives when one
burst of laughing in smoke.

13
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,090
That… What did it occur?

14
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,290
Somebody has just smashed the entry of the store.

15
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,157
That does not advance me. I will see…

16
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:01,291
Do not go there!

17
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:03,958
I will see who am the person in charge.

18
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,225
It is me.

19
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,624
You must be quite trustful
to dare to defy the Family Clown.

20
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,558
Cl… Family clown?

21
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:13,490
Ever intended to speak.

22
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,558
Then you go soon the knowledge!

23
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:17,624
Listen…

24
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,090
Retain this name well!

25
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:23,825
Because we will be soon Masters of these places!

26
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,690
Species of kabukimono!

27
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,291
Perhaps you believe that the authorities will leave you…

28
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:31,224
Kabukimono? It is amusing!
[Kabukimono:Organizes]

29
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,557
You think that all that would be done
if we fear Okappiki?

30
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:35,090
Stop this sweet talk, gangster!

31
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,225
And why you carry this false nose?!

32
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:41,625
He, remembers to you of a thing.

33
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:43,890
It is not a false nose.

34
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,290
It is a truth…

35
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,357
A true red nose…

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,025
and I hold to with it much.

37
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:55,358
They is for that I insane in bad temper
as soon as people say similar silly things!

38
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,891
It is unforgivable.

39
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:59,157
Owner, it is not reasonable to use this trick here.

40
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:02,357
I include/understand what you feel,
but to recover the money is our priority.

41
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:04,158
Isn't this?

42
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,691
Shit!

43
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,557
You of him occupy the guy!

44
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:08,358
Yes!

45
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,957
He, Onami! Another, another!

46
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,490
Not! It already is too!

47
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,358
Hein? Already?

48
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,357
Do you know how much you owe us already, Oyabun?!

49
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:29,024
To eat free just because U are a okappiki!

50
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,358
Would not be if radine…

51
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,625
Aren't the money, that go, that come?

52
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,425
Then I go…

53
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,225
You are unaware of me there, not?

54
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,490
Ah it is true!

55
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:45,424
I had also come to refund my debt!

56
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,957
Ah… yes yes yes yes, I had it
completely forgotten while I ate.

57
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,890
Then, say to me how much.

58
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,891
And I could also pay in advance.

59
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,558
Then what think you, Onami-its…

60
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,957
Fantastic! I can all take?!

61
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,024
Of course!

62
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:02,090
I will not make my skinflint! Take all!

63
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,224
Brilliant!

64
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,357
What a class, Oyabun!

65
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,490
- Be super for You!
The service is rather unforeseeable here…

66
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:07,224
The service is rather unforeseeable here…

67
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,090
About what you do speak? Te do not make a concern!

68
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,158
Sanji-kun!

69
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,824
Prepare a good-natured meal for Oyabun!

70
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,425
No the problem.

71
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:20,557
And here!

72
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:22,958
The dinner gastronome of Kazaguruma!

73
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,624
Itadakimasu!

74
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,424
Stupid Oyabun…

75
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,957
You accumulated not badly money, after all…

76
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,491
Then you will not need more to pay now.

77
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,890
It was money without interest after all…

78
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:39,091
Honestly, I thought that you would have
known as that you were encircled enemies…

79
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:42,290
But they is good. I forgive you.
You are entirely forgiven.

80
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:46,158
As long as will have you money,
I will forgive you all your faults.

81
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:49,224
How you ace made to pile up all that?

82
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,490
In fact, I stopped criminals recently.

83
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh! It is the reward of a large company?

84
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,157
Not, I infiltrated,
and there was much money which trailed.

85
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,691
And you took some?

86
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,957
It is not a little illéga…

87
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,025
Just a little, it is not serious!

88
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,358
Otento-sama you E will not want either.

89
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,424
Then, it was which these criminals?

90
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:10,225
Ah! It was a gang of counterfeiters.

91
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:15,158
THEN It IS COUNTERFEIT MONEY!!

92
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,090
I was enough idiot to believe it.

93
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:25,091
Do not cry, Onami-san. I am there.

94
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:28,890
I will return to you forever happy.

95
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,090
Sanji-kun.

96
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,291
Hello, can one have a fruit dish?

97
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,958
Mellorine! Immediately!

98
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,624
Special dresser of Kazaguruma!

99
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,891
Your beauty is like
the lightning tearing the limpid sky.

100
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,225
Ouaah! Splendid!

101
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,357
You find?

102
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:43,957
But we did not order something of so large.

103
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,158
No problem.

104
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:48,024
You will not need to pay me.

105
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:49,490
Of course, it is…

106
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,825
Taken directly on the wages of Sanji-kun.

107
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:56,090
That made how much time this morning, Sanji?

108
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:58,090
If that continues, you will work without being paid.

109
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,625
It is terrible-terrible-terrible!

110
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,224
Hey! Oyabun!

111
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,157
Oyabun with the Straw hat!

112
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:05,158
What still? Be too noisy for you.

113
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,957
Is Oyabun there?

114
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,091
I intended to say that he ate.

115
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:16,624
What you made Oyabun,
while the Family Clown showed himself downtown…

116
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,091
Family clown?

117
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:24,691
It is a terrible family which takes control by
the force of all the cities and shops which it crosses.

118
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,158
It has just arrived downtown.

119
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:30,691
In this moment even, the office
of exchange of main street is attacked.

120
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,225
At the moment, in full day?

121
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:33,557
Why did you avoid?

122
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,090
Will stop them!

123
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:37,224
Ah! Euh… I cannot do that all alone.

124
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:38,824
What? Make, it is to it all.

125
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,825
Thus they operate.

126
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:43,825
They do not have any pity towards those which resist to them.

127
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,758
For this reason all the mond is afraid
and do not dare to denounce them.

128
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:49,757
Like it there forever of complaints,
one cannot intervene.

129
00:05:49,758 --> 00:05:51,758
What a band of cowards!

130
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:55,224
Hey! You will just be unaware of them for that?

131
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:58,424
Why do you believe that one lets you eat here free!?

132
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,825
Rise quickly!

133
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:03,225
I would have agreed to rest me but…

134
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:05,290
When it is question of food…

135
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,491
And that one cannot let them make like that…

136
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:12,158
Then ok! I will stop them!

137
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:12,957
Bring to me in one!

138
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,490
Of agreement! Is Hiuchishi, it that?

139
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:17,558
But not! A cake and food!

140
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:20,491
BREAK FROM HERE!

141
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,157
It is all that you have?

142
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,357
Yes, all is there.

143
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,424
Detach me!

144
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:31,758
It would be said that it still remains you of energy.

145
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,024
You others!

146
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,290
Retain this well!

147
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:39,158
From now,
all the money of this city belongs to me.

148
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,290
Do not seek to hide it!

149
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,358
If you done it…

150
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:47,625
I will explode you with this ball
Special Baggy, then not of entourloupe.

151
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:53,358
Would not be too optimistic, buffoon!

152
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,558
What!?

153
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,557
You did not hear me?

154
00:06:57,558 --> 00:06:59,825
Are your ears there to decorate or what?

155
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:02,024
Lastly, I hope at least…

156
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,557
that it is not the case for your eyes.

157
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:09,758
I am one of the gardiens de la paix of this city,
with Oyabun with the straw hat, Usopp-sama!

158
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:14,225
You have me the quite trustful air for
a subordinate of Okappiki.

159
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:18,557
Try you to say to me that you
deal with us all alone?

160
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:22,225
The calm one… Oyabun soon will arrive.

161
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,425
Three…

162
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,691
Two…

163
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,225
One!

164
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,558
I' L was necessary to expect it,
Onami is always also specific.

165
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,491
Oyabun with the Straw hat, you to play!

166
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,957
This kid is Okappiki?!

167
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:50,824
I hold more! This city has surely much
to offer so that it makes me marrer as much!

168
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:54,825
Be really noisy for you, large red nose.

169
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:58,957
I do not know why came to you in this city…

170
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,690
but this place does not belong to you.

171
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:02,690
Frankly…

172
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,157
To destroy the houses of the others in full day.

173
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,357
It is you who ace done that.

174
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:07,957
Save to me the details.

175
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,891
I will close the eyes for this time
if you return on your premise calmly.

176
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,225
WHO HAS A LARGE RED NOSE?!

177
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,090
Species of dumb!

178
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:22,624
You me insults and me I should listen to you wisely!?

179
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,557
Then?

180
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:27,757
Oh that yes, your presence causes
problems with everyone.

181
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,090
Problems?

182
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,158
Who said that I caused problems?

183
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:36,825
Does somebody find that I cause him problems?

184
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,091
Shit, nobody.

185
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,758
Were owner, you maltreated, Isn't it?

186
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:50,558
These good people included/understood my
virility and beat a retreat.

187
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:53,091
A jutte does not have anything to make here.

188
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,158
I saw it!

189
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:00,290
I will testify some!

190
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,158
It struck the owner and took all the money!

191
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,025
Oyabun, capture it, I request from you.

192
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:07,757
What?

193
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,024
Tiny tanuki.

194
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:10,291
Come-there!

195
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:14,491
Hey…

196
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:16,090
How it did that?

197
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:17,625
I know anything of it.

198
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,625
Don't dumb, you want to suffer, not truth?

199
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,958
The farm!

200
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,958
They is even more painful to keep silence!

201
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,157
As you will want, I thus go
to make of you a bag in tanuki!

202
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:30,624
I AM A REINDEER!!

203
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,557
Dumb!

204
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:32,758
Oyabun?

205
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,691
OI! LARGE CONK!

206
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,491
, Bends down you!

207
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,825
Dumb! It is what this leg?!

208
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,424
Ah that? I ate the fruit Gomu Gomu,

209
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,291
I am a man-rubber.

210
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:00,024
A man-rubber?

211
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:01,490
The fruit Gomu Gomu?

212
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:04,958
Then you also, you are a user of a fruit of the demon!?

213
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:05,824
Bite!

214
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,025
That hurt.

215
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,157
TRY you ME TO RIDICULE OR WHAT?!

216
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:10,857
Usopp!

217
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:11,958
It left!

218
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:15,975
I hold you!

219
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,290
Captured!

220
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,958
Beautiful performance as usual.

221
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:25,625
Well, direction the police station!

222
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,758
I will listen to there what you have to say, then remains calm.

223
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,425
Rubber of shit…

224
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,225
Richie!

225
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:41,491
It is what that?

226
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:46,024
It is what?

227
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,025
A bomb!

228
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:55,090
Shit! It was right a smoke producer.

229
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,958
The dumb!

230
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,425
He disappeared! Money too!

231
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:03,425
Its men are also flee!

232
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:07,025
I wonder how it has demolishes its bonds.

233
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:09,624
Does Peuimporte, what one make now?

234
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,424
They are easily escaped, with the money!

235
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:14,958
Eh well, one can nothing there.

236
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:18,225
Well, one will end well up finding them.

237
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,425
Why if be slackened to you?

238
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:24,092
Did Ah, then this doctor testify?

239
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,091
You are rather courageous.

240
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,291
I could drive out this guy with the large conk thanks to you.

241
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,224
Thank you.

242
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,291
How I have fact was natural!

243
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,491
I do not want your gratitude, malicious!

244
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:37,758
Then, Onami, offers to him food for…

245
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,091
How Ca, “Then”?

246
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,557
Who will pay?

247
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,958
Oh! I did not do that for…

248
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:48,224
Would not be timid.

249
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,625
Oyabun does that because he likes you.

250
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,358
Enchanted.

251
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,358
Ouais, magic!

252
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:59,492
Well, I will leave one moment.

253
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,091
Oh, and where that?

254
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,558
Small businesses.

255
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,825
Burst, rubber band of shit!

256
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:10,492
Advances more quickly!

257
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,892
Ah! It is opposing!

258
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:13,757
What?

259
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,625
What did it occur?

260
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:18,357
The guy!

261
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,224
That made a long time!

262
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:23,625
Let us defer the greetings to later.

263
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,892
I want to hear the reason of this situation.

264
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,424
Lord, I do not ask large for thing…

265
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:44,292
But, made that many rich person customers us
bring much money, as at the beginning.

266
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,691
If not, it will be the bankruptcy.

267
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,291
It is true, then not jokes, that will not help me.

268
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,558
I count on you, Seigneur.

269
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:55,825
I feel much better!

270
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,157
He, children!

271
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,425
What v…

272
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,691
What do you say?

273
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:13,224
I have just received Yabumi.

274
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,291
He is written. “If you want to re-examine Onami,
come towards the bed from the river, but only Oyabun. “

275
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:19,557
It uses really a cruel method.

276
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:23,158
Yes, the problem it is that they have an hostage.

277
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:25,624
Do not worry you, I have a plan.

278
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,692
A plan?

279
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,892
Go, Usopp! Allons-y!

280
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,358
Oyabun, addition.

281
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:32,024
Put it on my ardoi…

282
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:32,925
Not…
Put it on my ardoi…

283
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:39,958
Shit! It gave me wire with retordre.

284
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,758
Does Yabumi, have reaches its target?

285
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,292
Of course.

286
00:13:57,225 --> 00:14:01,024
It was supposed to come only,
but good, it just brought its flunkey.

287
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,625
I am not a flunkey!

288
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:05,624
You are really loose to take an hostage!

289
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,957
Hostage?

290
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,292
Do not make the idiot! Return to us Onami!

291
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,425
One will return it to you in good state…

292
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:12,558
But!

293
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,757
Before that,

294
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:18,758
Some of our knowledge
would like to test their capacities against you.

295
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,425
You company to them, isn't this will hold?

296
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:22,692
Come by there!

297
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:24,625
Oyabun…

298
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:29,092
He the guy, come!

299
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,091
The killer with naked hands, Gedatsu.

300
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,892
The epeist with the six sabers, Hachi!

301
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:37,624
These bastards called reinforcements.

302
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,957
Ah, I forgot…

303
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,957
My subordinates are rather hard
and always do not listen to me…

304
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,292
In fact, they are of the guy rather unverifiable…

305
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:50,225
“Baggy”… “Kuma-chan”!

306
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:57,758
Then you are that which opposed the Clown?

307
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,292
Unforgivable!

308
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:06,425
The largest sword-man, Hachi-sama with the six sabers,
will send to you in the other world.

309
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:11,225
Who is tallest, you said?

310
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,758
Really? It is what this brothel?

311
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,825
Oyabun, is better to draw now…

312
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:33,757
Imbecile!

313
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,491
The jutte will be able to never compete with six sabers.

314
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:39,492
Hein?! Ten against six? I am losing!?

315
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:42,958
Which idiot.

316
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,624
Which idiot.

317
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,024
Yosh!

318
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:44,691
Yosh!

319
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:45,092
But, Oyabun!

320
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:46,158
But, Oyabun!

321
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:50,025
HEY! YOU FORGOT THAT I' L HAS an HOSTAGE THERE!?

322
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,424
Onami is well…

323
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,291
Apparently…

324
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,692
Not, you cannot…

325
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,158
It leaves from where that one!

326
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:01,758
Usopp!

327
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,224
Usopp!!

328
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,958
Why?

329
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,692
He you! What you have just made?!

330
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,624
Why do you draw up you still there?

331
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,957
How I could make such an error.

332
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,492
You cannot see like that!

333
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:16,225
It was so fast, I did not even can see it.

334
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:16,958
It was so fast, I did not even can see it.

335
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,157
Indeed, the name of this attack is the Jet Punch.

336
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:22,491
It is impossible for you to see it.

337
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:27,358
The only disadvantage,
it is that one can the utiser only once.

338
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,425
Say something, dumb!

339
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,225
Be to you idiot or what!?

340
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,025
Be to you idiot or what!?

341
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,291
How oses you to ridicule me?

342
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,691
You ridicule yourself all alone!

343
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,425
The farm! Eat that!

344
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,057
Hein?

345
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:45,392
You already have not just struck with this arm?

346
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,392
Oh not!

347
00:16:46,392 --> 00:16:46,925
Oh not!

348
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:52,792
They is all of the cretins.

349
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:54,857
He! Small elastic merdeux!

350
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,458
You ace nothing in the brain or what?!

351
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:58,892
There is always an hostage here, then would be less expeditious!

352
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,957
There is always an hostage here, then would be less expeditious!

353
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,824
Be too noisy for you.

354
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,424
I go you botter the bottom.

355
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,958
Moreover, Onami is not any more one hostage.

356
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,158
Hein?

357
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,292
Sanji-kun!

358
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,225
BUT You ES WHICH YOU?!

359
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:16,091
BUT You ES WHICH YOU?!

360
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:19,292
It did not return, I
asked what occurred.

361
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:22,892
You really made a large connery there…

362
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,958
I do not know who you are but I admire your courage.

363
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:28,024
The guy!

364
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:28,625
The guy!

365
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,957
You are the only one who remain, conk of shit.

366
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,092
You ace quite known as “of shit”?

367
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,758
You soon will regret having done that.

368
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,958
Are Onami-san, you wounded?

369
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:43,358
What makes you marrer?

370
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:43,958
What makes you marrer?

371
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,824
Insane steps of me.

372
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,692
I am always the head of the household.

373
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:48,892
I am always the head of the household.

374
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,825
Your adversary is there.

375
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,025
Your adversary is there.

376
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,824
Surprised?

377
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:04,692
I am also a user of fruit of the demon.

378
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,292
I can separate my own body with my suitability…

379
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,025
I can separate my own body with my suitability…

380
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:10,225
The man Bara Bara!

381
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:17,225
And now, man-rubber.
I know which is your weak point.

382
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:18,357
They is the blades, not truth?

383
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,224
Completely.

384
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,025
Do not say to him so easily!

385
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:25,025
Prepare.

386
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:27,625
I will make you suffer.

387
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,758
Here me is, Straw hat!

388
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:33,892
Come.

389
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,291
Your lower part had far too openings.

390
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:46,825
Dumb.

391
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,491
Dumb.

392
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:51,358
It is the body part of a man
who should always remain intact.

393
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,692
That does not concern a taker of hostages!

394
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:56,692
As promised, I will boot you the bottom!

395
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,892
Baggy!

396
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,757
It is all that you merits.

397
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:15,091
Oh, it steals super good.

398
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:18,025
I imagine that it will remain
quiet one good moment after that.

399
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:19,891
Hey! Are Usopp, you well?

400
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,825
Come, Onami-san, I will detach you.

401
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,425
Come, Onami-san, I will detach you.

402
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,758
Thank you, Sanji-kun.

403
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,358
Then…

404
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:33,491
thus Oyabun overcame the Family Clown.

405
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:34,957
I did not expect from it less Oyabun.

406
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,824
You fought Usopp well even
while having been so seriously wounded.

407
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,224
Hein? Oh yes, of course!

408
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:42,891
I remember to be myself beaten against hundred as of theirs.

409
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:45,158
HUNDRED! INCREDIBLE!

410
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,424
And all that before the breakfast!

411
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,625
BEFORE EATING?! ENORMOUS!!

412
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,291
But they nevertheless took all the money, not?

413
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,024
Ah, it is not so serious.

414
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,092
Why?

415
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,024
To tell you the truth, the money which they took…

416
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,092
it was forgery!

417
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:02,724
What?!

418
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,157
It is true…

419
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:06,491
There are no badly people who have one
natural talent to locate it.

420
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:10,024
Oyabun remembered the face of the counterfeiter.

421
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:13,092
It was acted in fact of the owner of the bureau de change.

422
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:16,058
It called the police station right afterwards.

423
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:17,624
Surprising, it made its job.

424
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,224
Eh well, it is the kind of anybody who
fact its job when that becomes necessary.

425
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:23,291
It has interest, if not it would not be
that a dying glouton of hunger.

426
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:24,625
It is true.

427
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,158
No the doubt.

428
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,025
One would speak about me in my back?

429
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:34,292
It is hard the celebrity.

430
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,192
Give up.

431
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:57,992
You cannot escape to us.

432
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,191
You are an invaluable source of revenue.

433
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:06,191
We will not have any evil
if you are to us well nicely.

434
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:07,458
Do not touch me!

435
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,258
Small plague!

436
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,192
Does not underestimate us!

437
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:30,457
But be to you which you?

438
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,058
What you insane here?

439
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,325
I have something to say to you.

440
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,192
There are not time to listen to your sermons.

441
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:40,592
Unless you do not want to play the heroes?

442
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,792
To save people, it is the job of God or Buddha.

443
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,192
That does not interest me

444
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,058
Nevertheless, do I can take part in the business?

445
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:52,524
Eaten, nor not drunk, since three days.

446
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:55,525
I will not tear off any more rewards
if I continue like that.

447
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:59,058
Get stuffed, old bonze merdic!

448
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,325
Oups, sorry…

449
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,924
My hand slipped.

450
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,658
Dumb!

451
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:16,624
Oï, Usopp. I want to make the night round well…

452
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,724
but aumoins that one takes puffs out front.

453
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:20,392
I am hungry.

454
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:21,459
I am hungry.

455
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,792
Species of…

456
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,058
A baston.

457
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,392
Bastard!

458
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,124
He is hefty man!

459
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,592
In a flash…

460
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:44,724
Oh not, the Straw hat!

461
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:45,992
We break!

462
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:48,724
Shit!

463
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:51,059
You pays nothing to await… dumb!

464
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:53,859
Which waste of time.

465
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,258
Hein? It seems to me to have already seen them before.

466
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,459
Are Oï, you well?

467
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,658
What do you have?

468
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,459
Oh but you are wounded!

469
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:13,792
He, wait!

470
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:18,058
One can know what you did here?
You will have to follow us to the station.

471
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,059
What did I make?

472
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,524
I saw you!

473
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,791
It is you who wounded it!

474
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,124
Quiet remainder!

475
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,459
It is not him, Usopp.

476
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,059
Its wound is that of a katana.

477
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:32,859
With such a talent, it would not have
need to escape like that.

478
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,525
With such a talent, it would not have
need to escape like that.

479
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,592
Goodbye, Oyabun with the Straw hat.

480
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:38,792
Goodbye, Oyabun with the Straw hat.

481
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:40,325
Ouais, goodbye.

482
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:43,859
How does it know which I am?

483
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:46,259
He, where do you go?

484
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:50,125
Are He, sure for you that goes?

485
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:53,592
Oyabun!

486
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:55,592
It is a girl!

487
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,925
The wound is closed again now,
there is to worry no more.

488
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:08,324
She was very tired in any case.

489
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,592
Let us give him the drug, and let it rest.

490
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:13,925
That will go. She will go better tomorrow.

491
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,125
Well, so much better.

492
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,424
I brought back the futon of Onami-san too.

493
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,459
Thank you. Pose it here.

494
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:23,792
Of agreement.

495
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,992
Then, how does that occur?

496
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,058
Apparently all is well.

497
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,024
She was to be very tired.

498
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:32,524
She sleeps deeply.

499
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,924
She is beautiful like an angel.

500
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:37,391
I feel that it is the destiny which wanted this meeting.

501
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:37,992
It is true that it is beautiful.

502
00:24:37,992 --> 00:24:39,591
It is true that it is beautiful.

503
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:42,058
But I still do not include/understand
why it tried to flee.

504
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,925
I suspect that it is because of…

505
00:24:44,392 --> 00:24:48,059
An old bonze merdic and very extremely…

506
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:52,058
It is what one says to you.

507
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,859
One was stopped by
a bonze with the monstrous force.

508
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:56,724
THAT I HAD INCLUDED/UNDERSTOOD!

509
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:58,858
Do not speak to me with half deadened!

510
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,859
How dare you to return the empty handeds?!
Bandage rotted pumpkin maggots!

511
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:06,524
You know how much it is worth this girl?

512
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:07,925
Afflicted!

513
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,525
Owner!

514
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,992
There is an little idea of the place where this girl is.

515
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:14,792
The Straw hat?

516
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,191
Yosh.

517
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:18,324
Bring to me this bonze here.

518
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:21,391
One cannot let pass an occasion
similar to earn money.

519
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:22,525
Included/understood?!

520
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:24,925
Then it is called Vivi?

521
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,524
Then it is called Vivi?

522
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,392
Yes.

523
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:32,325
But although it gave us his name,
she did not want anything to say of other.

524
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,924
Its state is stable, however.

525
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:37,992
I see. If it is well, it is essence.

526
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:38,925
Oh! Onami! To eat, eat!

527
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,458
Oh! Onami! To eat, eat!

528
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,525
Me too!

529
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,724
Welcome!

530
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:46,525
Oyabun with the Straw hat and Doctor to the blue nose.

531
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:48,325
Hein? What do you make equipped like that?

532
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:50,259
Hein? What do you make equipped like that?

533
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:53,191
I work here from today.

534
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:54,924
THE VIVI-CHAN, YOU ES BEST

535
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:56,592
TOO MUCH NICE…

536
00:25:57,592 --> 00:26:00,392
I could not refuse his assistance after all that.

537
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,191
You are well, now?

538
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:02,591
Yes.

539
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:03,058
Yes.

540
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,059
Thanks to the doctor salary
with the blue nose, I feel better.

541
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:11,658
Keep silent yourself! I like at all
that me am launched flowers, malicious!

542
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:12,125
Malicious.

543
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:12,591
Malicious.

544
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:13,659
I see. Such an amount of better.

545
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:14,259
I see. Such an amount of better.

546
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,791
Vivi, can you serve the tea, please.

547
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:17,592
Yes.

548
00:26:22,325 --> 00:26:23,659
He, it is by there, Vivi.

549
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:24,525
He, it is by there, Vivi.

550
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,992
I wanted to really go from the good side but…

551
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,259
To serve the tea…

552
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:30,259
To serve the tea…

553
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:31,859
It is hard…

554
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:36,458
You never served the tea?

555
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,458
In fact… it is the first time of my life.

556
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:39,259
Hein?

557
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,792
I am there almost… I am there almost…

558
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:54,725
THAT BURNS!!!

559
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:55,592
Die… Afflicted!
THAT BURNS!!!

560
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:56,259
Die… Afflicted!

561
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,724
You do not have anything, Vivi-chan?

562
00:26:58,725 --> 00:26:59,258
You do not have anything, Vivi-chan?

563
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,924
WORRY RATHER FOR US!!

564
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,191
Well, well…

565
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:05,125
What would say you to eat one
delicious meal to forget that?

566
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,524
Sanji-kun, hurries.

567
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,259
Yes, Mellorine!

568
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:12,792
Will that go?

569
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,392
In a way or another… This time…

570
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:20,725
That with the good air!

571
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:20,991
That with the good air!

572
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,659
That still saw!

573
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:34,259
You are well, Vivi-chan?

574
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:37,991
I am delighted that Vivi want to help us…

575
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:40,192
but I am afraid for the future.

576
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:47,591
He, of the tea please!

577
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:48,991
Yes, Ca comes!
Vivi-chan, here too!

578
00:27:48,992 --> 00:27:49,791
By here…

579
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:50,691
On this side…

580
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,592
Afflicted to have made you wait.

581
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,592
He Ben, that filled of a blow.

582
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:54,924
He Ben, that filled of a blow.

583
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:55,424
Welcome.

584
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,991
The rumor concerning Vivi was spread in the village.

585
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,058
A rumor concerning Vivi?

586
00:27:59,059 --> 00:27:59,591
Thank you!

587
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,925
Yes. How what there was a splendid waitress!

588
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:02,324
Yes. How what there was a splendid waitress!

589
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:03,259
Thanks to what, the trade is prosperous. Vivi is brilliant!

590
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:05,792
Thanks to what, the trade is prosperous. Vivi is brilliant!

591
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:06,725
I am occupied, occupied.

592
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:07,391
I am occupied, occupied.

593
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:09,324
Vivi-chan! One will tenpura soba!

594
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:10,191
Here too!

595
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:11,392
Yes!

596
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:13,992
Vivi is too nice.

597
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,592
Onami-chan also is nice.
But she likes too the money.

598
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:19,458
Vivi-chan is the best, after all.

599
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:22,258
From now on, I will trail the every day in Kazaguruma.

600
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:23,192
Me too.

601
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:26,391
Stop that, band of manures.

602
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:28,324
MATER Vivi-chan like that with length of time…

603
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:28,824
MATER Vivi-chan like that with length of time…

604
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:30,459
Customers of shit!

605
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:30,792
Customers of shit!

606
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,725
Customers of shit, you ace known as?

607
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:34,992
MT MOUTH!

608
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:37,258
IF IT SE STILL MAKES RELUQUER
BY YOUR PERVERSE GLANCES…

609
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,859
THE BEAUTY OF VIVI-CHAN
WILL BE SOILED FOREVER!

610
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:41,391
I AI NOT NEED FOR YOUR MONEY!

611
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:43,325
INSANE THE CAMP!

612
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:44,058
Sanji-san!

613
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,192
Wait! What you make the customers?!

614
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:53,259
Why you feed this chaos, Oyabun?!

615
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,192
Return to Kazaguruma of front.

616
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:04,925
Maintaining these insects crasseux
are not ready to return.

617
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:06,591
You can finally slacken, Vivi-chwan.

618
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:09,992
WITHOUT CUSTOMER, THE BUSINESSES SE WILL DETERIORATE!

619
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:14,525
Hidokuruma is of return in Kazaguruma.
[Hidokuruma:Bad furtune]

620
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,391
I am afflicted, Onami-san.

621
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:18,191
I was not very useful to you.

622
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:20,658
Do not worry you for that. It is not your fault, Vivi.

623
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,659
Ouais, ouais! Do not worry you!

624
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:24,458
Oh, it is not well.

625
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:27,325
I forgot an important promise. I go there.

626
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,192
Ah yes, Vivi. You can come, too.

627
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:37,192
When they are the promises of Oyabun,
it is always to have fun.

628
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:40,792
You ace of the temps libre in any event.
That will go here, you can take a pause.

629
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:45,392
To have fun? But where?

630
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:46,125
Ben… you will see it by yourself!

631
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,792
Ben… you will see it by yourself!

632
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:51,325
Heat in front!

633
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:58,492
I finally found it.

634
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,559
Frankly, which annoying girl.

635
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:14,208
Its force is monstrous but…
its appetite is even more!

636
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,809
Our provisions…

637
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,609
Aa… I fix.

638
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:22,809
Then… You wanted to speak to me?

639
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:31,808
Look at me, Vivi, I will fish large there.

640
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:33,875
Then am not afraid.

641
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:36,142
That is well, now.

642
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:37,741
Do not make any you.

643
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:40,141
Y has any means that Oyabin makes a large catch.

644
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,474
Oyabin is large a bouzu, after all.

645
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:43,941
Be hard for you…

646
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,141
Look at me well.

647
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,274
Bouzu?

648
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:50,009
That which does not manage to take
only one fish is called bouzu.

649
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:51,809
That bites!

650
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,142
That bites!

651
00:30:56,742 --> 00:30:58,874
You ace makes a large catch, that it is clear!

652
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,875
Is Oyabun, it the first time that dead?

653
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,075
Good blood, it is too odd.

654
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:07,675
Vivi, tests, you.

655
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:08,275
Vivi, tests, you.

656
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,409
You believe that I would arrive there?

657
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:15,142
Do the fish eat really these small beasts?

658
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:15,809
Do the fish eat really these small beasts?

659
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,342
Hein? You ace ever seen of vers de terre?

660
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:18,808
Hein? You ace ever seen of vers de terre?

661
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:21,074
It would be said that Vivi do not know large thing.

662
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,142
It is stupider than us!

663
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:28,009
You know, I also put yourself the question on this subject…

664
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:31,942
But it is not a reason to shout it, you others.

665
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:36,675
But the soft foods were not like that, with the castle.

666
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:38,742
With the castle?

667
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:41,075
Not…

668
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,474
Then… How does one make use of it?

669
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,742
You explain me?

670
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:48,442
It is terrible! Terrible!

671
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,474
It is absurd!

672
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:54,241
Why would Vivi-chan be on an research opinion?

673
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:57,108
It was distributed to the seat of the government.

674
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:01,975
This document is used to seek discreetly
a person which one is unaware of the identity and his localization.

675
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,309
I could not make like
so of nothing was not in this connection.

676
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:08,641
I think that it is about one
spy come from another country…

677
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:11,575
or a member of a higher authority.

678
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:16,109
Why?

679
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,574
Species of dumb!

680
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:20,042
To treat Vivi-chan of criminal!

681
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:27,375
But… Vivi, which is really?

682
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:30,641
Goodbye, Oyabin!

683
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,175
With the next one!

684
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,509
Also return, Vivi! Promise it!

685
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:37,841
Yes! So long everyone!

686
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:39,309
Be careful!

687
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,374
Yo! Be to you the bonze of the other time!

688
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,574
I do not test any resentment towards you.

689
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:50,374
but I must return this favor.

690
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,309
Do not take it personally.

691
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,909
What do you tell?

692
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,442
You us because step badly of troubles
the last time, Straw hat.

693
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,374
It is not gratitude but…

694
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:08,375
can you accept this modest gift of end of the year?

695
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:12,642
A aller simple for the Sanzu river!

696
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,374
Ah, it is Baggy.

697
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,375
If you want to treat with me, come to see me directly.

698
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,309
Would not be so shameless.

699
00:33:19,975 --> 00:33:23,509
We are interested only in the invaluable woman, over there.

700
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:26,309
Invaluable woman? Hein?

701
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:32,109
If you wish to face me, it will be necessary
initially it to beat, rubber of shit!

702
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:42,074
It is like that, Oyabun with the Straw hat.

703
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:45,508
It is odd. What do you await ego?

704
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,042
Fight!

705
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,976
He, a technique with three saber… Interesting.

706
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:09,509
Owner!

707
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:13,474
Hein

708
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:18,709
Oï! Oyabun with the Straw hat,
it was what this punch merdic?

709
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,242
Well then take that!

710
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:22,709
Well then take that!

711
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,808
Oï! Where you aim? I am there!

712
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:32,776
Ah! Bastard!

713
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:35,842
Oï! Fight elsewhere!

714
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,042
It is the moment…

715
00:34:40,776 --> 00:34:42,042
Vien Richie!

716
00:35:04,909 --> 00:35:06,508
Afflicted, my hand slipped.

717
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:07,976
Liar!

718
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:11,042
Dumb! You misled us!

719
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:24,791
Afflicted, my hand still slipped.

720
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,959
Hum…

721
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,025
Thank you very much.

722
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,826
It is not the first, but
second time that you save me the life.

723
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,692
Small rubber merdeux!

724
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:37,491
Now, I am really in anger!

725
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:40,226
I will explode this false bonze
and all others with him!

726
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:45,092
What? When it has…

727
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:46,759
Die!

728
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:49,526
Hein?

729
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:52,092
It IS WHAT THAT?!!

730
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:54,692
It is very hot, very.

731
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:58,525
They is not good.

732
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:00,425
The owner is an anvil.

733
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,092
One must save it.

734
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,258
Thank you very much.

735
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:07,991
It will be very for today.

736
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:10,092
What has it just occurred, there?

737
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:17,491
OYABUN!!

738
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,025
Vivi!

739
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:19,892
There here! Vivi!

740
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:22,626
Hein? What arrives to you?

741
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:26,026
He, Oyabun! It is a liar!

742
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,026
Look at this research opinion!

743
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:30,359
It is what? It is Vivi, not?

744
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:32,291
It is what this history?

745
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:35,492
It does not matter what it is, I was sure!

746
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,991
I was sure…

747
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:40,958
Vivi isn't malicious, hein?

748
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,024
Said?

749
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:42,624
Malicious?

750
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,625
HEY!
Malicious?

751
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:45,425
Of course that not!

752
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:48,959
There is nothing special… on this subject…

753
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:51,426
He, you!

754
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:56,159
Who do you believe that this person is?

755
00:36:56,226 --> 00:36:59,426
It is the princess of Jipangu! The Vivi-sama princess!

756
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,292
SLACKEN IT IMMEDIATELY!

757
00:37:03,092 --> 00:37:04,759
Princess?

758
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,559
Grandfather…

759
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,492
That… Vivi… Be to you a princess?

760
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,425
Incredible! A true princess!

761
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:16,359
Yes.

762
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:20,559
YOU DO NOT INCLUDE/UNDERSTAND OR WHAT!? SLACKEN it!!

763
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:40,158

SUPERVISE YOUR WORDS! YOUNG PERSON INSOLATE!

765
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:43,959
Stop grandfather.

766
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,426
But, Vivi-sama…

767
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,559
Afflicted friends.

768
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:55,759
I never lived apart from the castle,
then I wanted to see the life of outside.

769
00:37:56,026 --> 00:38:02,959
Good blood, why not have andé with somebody of
to accompany you, rather than to start all this bazaar?

770
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:07,426
But, grandfather did not listen
never and refused all the time.

771
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,625
Obviously.

772
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:11,492
What would you have made if something were arrives?

773
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:16,759
It is for that the Family Clown in
had after Vivi. They wanted to hold to ransom it.

774
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:20,158
It is true qu it exists full people without scruple!

775
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,691
Afflicted, grandfather.

776
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:23,092
But… But…

777
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:23,826
But… But…

778
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,358
I am glad to have met to you.

779
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,759
It was amusing.

780
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,291
I did not know many things,

781
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:34,225
but Oyabun with the Straw hat
and the others learned to me so much…

782
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:36,359
Everyone was very nice.

783
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:42,226
This is why, I wish to make
this country a much better place!

784
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,358
But please, do not start again more.

785
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,026
If you too often remade that,
I would not make old bone.

786
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:53,626
I include/understand.

787
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:57,492
I will not leave any more the castle without permission.

788
00:38:57,692 --> 00:38:59,692
Thank you with all.

789
00:38:59,892 --> 00:39:05,559
It was a short visit, but I will not forget
never time that I passed with you!

790
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:07,626
Vivi-tan…

791
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:24,958
The attitude of Vivi-sama improved.

792
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:25,826
Yes.

793
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:31,625
The last events did not make
that to encourage its ambitions.

794
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,692
They is rather good to know.

795
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:34,826
Yes…

796
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:42,958
Princess Vivi, return quickly, I request from you.

797
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:46,826
I have some more than enough…

798
00:39:47,826 --> 00:39:49,959
The adviser seems to have concern.

799
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,159
Yes! I touched it!

800
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,825
Wow! Impressing!

801
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,091
Be gifted for you!

802
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,025
Really?

803
00:39:58,026 --> 00:40:01,324
Vivi-chan! I believed never again to re-examine you!

804
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:04,291
It was not supposed not to leave the castle any more?

805
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,692
Without permission, not.

806
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,826
She said that they there authorized it, therefore they are good.

807
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:12,758
I imagine that must be hard
for the adviser, in this moment.

808
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,092
Yosh!

809
00:40:15,226 --> 00:40:16,025
Oyabun!

810
00:40:16,026 --> 00:40:18,359
It is interdict to use the techniques Gomu Gomu!

811
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:19,759
Oups!

812
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,559
Of agreement…

813
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,959
Which din…

814
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,159
It is still them.

815
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:33,626
I can sleep even more quietly.

816
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,025
Oyabun!

817
00:40:35,026 --> 00:40:37,559
It is terrible! Terrible!

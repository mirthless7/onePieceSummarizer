1
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:57,233
Help me...

2
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,003
Don't you dare make my navigator cry!

3
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,093
( Pinweel )
GOMU GOMU NO KAZAGURUMA!

4
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,572
( Pinweel )
GOMU GOMU NO KAZAGURUMA!

5
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,698
Whoa! What the?

6
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,493
Those who have the powers of the
Devil's Fruit are dead weights!

7
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:45,165
But in this situation, even a normal
person would sink, wouldn't they?

8
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,917
He can't be... into the sea!?

9
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,544
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

10
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:49,836
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

11
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,837
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

12
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:50,879
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

13
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,429
You bastard!

14
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,021
This is bad...no strength to move!

15
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:18,321
LUFFY DROWNING!
ZORO VS OCTOPUS HATCHAN!

16
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,243
What do you think? Interesting game, isn't it?

17
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,288
We'll see how long that rubberman can last.

18
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,875
Or will you guys die before he does?

19
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,506
This is terrible, Johnny!

20
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,466
Luffy-aniki's stuck underwater!

21
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,802
In the water, he can't do anything to save himself!

22
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,222
I'll beat this jerk's ass real quick,

23
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:42,722
I'll beat this jerk's ass real quick,

24
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,264
I'll beat this jerk's ass real quick,

25
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,933
Then I'll save you, Luffy!

26
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,810
TAKO HACHI BLACK!

27
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,903
My hair! You bastard!

28
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,990
I'm gonna...

29
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,493
l mean, it's only hair, it'll grow back.

30
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,788
Roronoa Zoro, you can never beat me!

31
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,332
Because l have six hands.

32
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,543
lsn't this cool? lsn't it wonderful?

33
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,460
You octopus bastard!

34
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,506
Tako-san-ren-shin-ken-shira-ha-dori!

35
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,342
Tako-san-ren-shin-ken-shira-ha-dori!

36
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,430
Ow! That hurt!

37
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,640
l don't have time to play around with you!

38
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,686
This isn't good...

39
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,229
He's..?

40
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,564
He's..?

41
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,774
Getting distracted by him will bring your death!

42
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,900
The fish fighting against the cook!?

43
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,444
The fish fighting against the cook!?

44
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,864
We're running out of time...

45
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:42,741
Quit struggling! This is pointless!

46
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,742
Quit struggling! This is pointless!

47
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,117
Quit struggling! This is pointless!

48
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,166
Tako Hachi..... Number... 9.

49
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,673
What's with you? Get your ass down here!

50
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,632
Nyu~

51
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,094
You freakin' octopus...

52
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,393
That octopus bastard, he's just wasting time!

53
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,981
If we go in the water now, we'll get
dragged down to the bottom!!

54
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,193
But if we wait, Luffy-aniki is gonna die!

55
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,070
We've got to think of something!

56
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,613
Wait a minute!

57
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,201
You guys are severely wounded. If you go
into the water, what good can you do?

58
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,746
You'll never make it.

59
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,750
l'll go save that rubber boy.

60
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,585
You...you're going?

61
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,465
His survival is the key to win this fight.

62
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,342
I know it.

63
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,635
I'll go with you!

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,636
Me too!

65
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,595
I'm going!

66
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,013
No!

67
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:51,351
We can't go in a crowd, the mermen will notice.

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,937
There's no reason to endanger their fight.

69
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,896
Gen-san!

70
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,442
This is the only way we can do it.

71
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,111
I can handle it.

72
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,363
Are you alright with that?

73
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,615
Forgive us... thank you!

74
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,244
We're counting on you! Please hurry!

75
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,578
Wait!

76
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,771
Gen-san, l'm going too.

77
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:15,583
But Nojiko, your hurts...

78
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,587
They're fighting for my little sister!

79
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,966
Gen-san!

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,972
Okay. Come on.

81
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:29,556
Hurry!

82
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,015
Right!

83
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,603
I'm sorry... If onIy we had more strength...

84
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,399
We'II entrust Aniki to you.

85
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,704
You freakin' fish bastard!

86
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,756
Roronoa Zoro, can l ask you one thing?

87
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,885
I've heard that you fight with three swords,
why do you only have one now?

88
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,220
One is just fine! You're still gonna lose!

89
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,140
Hey, shut up! I haven't gotten serious yet!

90
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,223
Hey, shut up! I haven't gotten serious yet!

91
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:18,855
Truth is human swordsmen don't
stand a chance against me.

92
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,983
lt'll surprise you! Astound you! Shock you!

93
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:23,902
Shit...

94
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,154
The pain's kicking in again, at the worst time...

95
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,032
Fever's getting worse, too...

96
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,243
I thought I could just waIk it off...

97
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,165
Nyu?

98
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,085
Huh?

99
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,920
Shit! l knew it. You haven't recovered from...

100
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,423
The wound that Hawk-eyes gave you..!

101
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,092
Aniki!

102
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,680
What's this? Pretending to be sick
is a good strategy, very good!

103
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,223
But I won't fall for that!

104
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,893
Roronoa Zoro! Let me show you my true skill!

105
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:05,443
Behold, my real skill! Six-sword fighting style!

106
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,363
Hey! Don't fall over!

107
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,489
Don't insult me!

108
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,743
Aniki!

109
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,537
I knew it! He's been enduring it all this time!

110
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,163
You're right!

111
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,290
Those were wounds that would keep a normal person

112
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,710
from walking for half a year
if they didn't kill him first!!

113
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,544
What did you say?

114
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,719
I knew it was strange that he could
fight with such a straight face!!

115
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,470
Stupid, stupid bastard...

116
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,023
Didn't l tell you to pay attention?

117
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,734
l'm a 40th Level Merman Karate Master!

118
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,444
Huh? What was that?

119
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,404
Did someone just fly through here?

120
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,947
Oh, Aniki?

121
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,490
Cook-aniki!

122
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,039
Cook-aniki!!

123
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,638
lt's over now, Arlong-san.

124
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,473
What should we do with Roronoa Zoro?

125
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,416
Toss his ass into the sea.

126
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,552
How pathetic...

127
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,670
How boring...

128
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,306
Nyu?

129
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:17,766
lt's over?

130
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,311
But they really did make a mess around here...

131
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,979
That's no big deal.

132
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,483
lt's alright as long as Arlong Park still stands.

133
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,442
You're right.

134
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,404
You bastard! Roronoa Zoro!

135
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:31,571
You bastard! Roronoa Zoro!

136
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,949
He was scared to death before
l got to show my skill!

137
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,870
I would've been so famous if
you had fallen by my blades!

138
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,332
Well, it doesn't matter.

139
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:42,874
Humans still can't compete against me

140
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,333
Humans still can't compete against me

141
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,669
Humans still can't compete against me

142
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,086
Humans still can't compete against me

143
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,672
and my wonderful, amazing six-sword
style! You can't touch me!

144
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,098
That's enough, Hachi.

145
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,016
I understand how you feel,

146
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,769
but if you get serious, it might get dangerous.

147
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,688
You want to destroy Arlong Park?

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,774
Huh? Huh? Oh yeah, l'm sorry.

149
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,902
l just forgot myself for a minute there...

150
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,781
It's fine, forget it.

151
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,534
Six-swords style, huh?

152
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:18,910
You're full of crap.

153
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,338
Aniki!

154
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,217
Roronoa Zoro!

155
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,928
Let me just make one thing very clear, Octopus.

156
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,306
There is someone that l must meet again.

157
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,393
And until that day...

158
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,315
Not even Death himself can take my life away!

159
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,070
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

160
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,161
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

161
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,714
Shit! How fast can this long-nose run?

162
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,842
His speed and stamina are incredible... Chu~

163
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,639
If I can distract even one of Arlong's guys...

164
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,809
It should help Luffy and the others out!

165
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,437
What agreat idea, Usopp-sama!

166
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,940
You're so dependable and loyal, aren't
you? But thats a gift, isn't it?

167
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,945
Huh? He's not following me anymore?

168
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,655
Damn, that's too bad!

169
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,491
Looks like l left him in my dust...

170
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:45,330
He may look like a fish in water,
but he's just a turtle on land!

171
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,998
Heehee... Turtle..!

172
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,628
Yeah, yeah!! Turtle, turtle!

173
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,464
If you really think you can catch me, try, try!

174
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:58,176
I'll dust your ass again, you lazy, lazy turtle, yeeeah!

175
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,595
Wouldn't that be you?

176
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,764
The one who's being lazy, I mean.

177
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,769
Wait!

178
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,777
He's onIy been drowned for a whiIe.

179
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,988
If we can get him back to the surface,
we can resuscitate him.

180
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,284
Shit! This cement is too hard.

181
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,703
I can't swing very weII underwater...

182
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,329
Gen-san, we have to hurry!

183
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,164
No use. It's too hard to break.

184
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,334
We couId reaIIy use an air canister,

185
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,587
There's no way we can take the
bIock up to the surface...

186
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:35,964
That's it!

187
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:36,631
That's it!

188
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,531
He's still alive, that guy!

189
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,575
Aniki! Cook-aniki!

190
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,454
That fish bastard's punch is Level 40?

191
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,377
Then the shitty old man's kicks I always
took must've been Level 400.

192
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,800
What's with you, Roronoa Zoro?

193
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,845
Why do you keep pushing yourself to go on?

194
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:27,891
I don't think you can defeat me
and my six swords as you are.

195
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,019
I think anyone in the world would say the same...

196
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:33,146
Shut up, it's none of your business...

197
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,358
This isn't good... Aniki's condition...

198
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,612
The fever's probably making him lose consciousness.

199
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,448
He's delirious.

200
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,283
If that wound opens again, he'll die without a doubt.

201
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,453
But he doesn't have time to think about that now!

202
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,040
Right! If there's anyone who knows that, it's Aniki!

203
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,501
l'll show you...

204
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,169
my San-tou-ryu...

205
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,212
Nyu?

206
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,090
Yosaku, Johnny! Lend me your swords!

207
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,550
Of course, Aniki!

208
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,010
Catch!

209
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,931
Shit... I'm Iosing it.

210
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,225
How many more minutes can I hang on?

211
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:12,727
Aniki, here they come!

212
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,604
Don't you want to use them?

213
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:19,651
Hah! Now you'll see the barrier that two-handed
humans will never surpass.

214
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,819
Roku-tou-ryu!

215
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,278
Aniki, watch out!

216
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,655
Tako Ashi Kiken!

217
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,781
Aniki!!

218
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,330
SAN-TOU-RYU...

219
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:39,546
TOUROU HAGASHI!
(Bleeding the Wolf!)

220
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,717
NYU~ !!

221
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,637
Got him!

222
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,141
The six swords didn't touch him! Aniki's awesome!

223
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,273
That takes such concentration...
and persistence as well!

224
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,360
How could this be?

225
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,698
I'm reaIly mad now! I'm going to kill you!

226
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,743
Just think about it normally, would you?

227
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,956
You cannot match six swords when
you can only carry three yourself.

228
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,041
Don't you get it!?

229
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,586
Normally? That's a major miscalculation.

230
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,504
What burdens you?

231
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,090
After you become strong, what do you wish to find?

232
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:29,346
I will... I will become stronger together with her!

233
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,906
'Til my name is heard even in the Heavens!

234
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,183
I'll become stronger!

235
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,153
'Til I become the strongest in the
world, the King of Swordsmen!

236
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,948
Three swords...

237
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,117
Six swords...

238
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,372
Numbers don't matter!

239
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:03,004
I may only have three swords, but yours
wiII NEVER be as heavy as mine!!

240
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,397
The weight, is it?

241
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,982
Now I understand.

242
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,901
Your swords are heavier? Eh?

243
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:25,777
But don't think that'll help,

244
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,239
each of my swords weighs 300kg, you know!

245
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:34,202
They're much heavier and more powerful
than any of your swords, you moron!

246
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,747
It's useless talking to an idiot...

247
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,333
Roku-tou-ryu, Tako Tsubo no Kamae!

248
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,002
Shin Shun!

249
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,296
Takoage!

250
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:45,630
Shit!
Takoage!

251
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,089
Shit!

252
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:48,883
TAIKAI!

253
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,178
That's dirty! Aiming for his wound!

254
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,471
Watch out!

255
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,222
Aniki!!

256
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:55,765
Aniki's gonna be killed!

257
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,976
You won't hit the ground alive.

258
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,477
Roku-tou-ryu, Ougi!

259
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,563
Roku-tou no WA-RU-TSU!

260
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:06,067
Touch these for second and you're mincemeat!!
You don't have a chance!

261
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:07,986
Aniki!

262
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,537
The pain...!

263
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,747
Aniki!

264
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:35,627
That jerk, he spun with me in the air
and did somersaults on my swords!

265
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:39,100
Then he cut my hands like some kind of circus trick!

266
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,188
Now I'm REALLY PISSED, and
I'm going to destroy you!

267
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:53,448
Aniki...

268
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:54,991
he's in so much pain...

269
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:59,037
That probably opened his wound again.

270
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,582
Ah... if only I could suffer in his place!

271
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,212
A wound that'd make an ordinary
man unconscious...

272
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,382
l won't lose to it.

273
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,513
Roku-tou-ryu! Tako Tsubo no Kamae!

274
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,056
This is the end!

275
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,686
A wound that would kill an ordinary person...

276
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,063
I won't lose to it!

277
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,648
Shin Shun!

278
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,402
To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes...

279
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,030
l can't allow myself to be ordinary!

280
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,706
TATSUMAKI!!

281
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:02,767
Hachi!

282
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,145
How?

283
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,773
San-tou-ryu...

284
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,276
How could..?

285
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,491
Octopus jerk...

286
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,911
Now do you understand...

287
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,790
How much heavier my swords are?

288
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,251
You satisfied?

289
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,858
Enough tears.

290
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,777
Enough talk.

291
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:57,906
lt's time to make up my mind!

292
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,076
l've got to go!

293
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,453
They're all fighting.!

294
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,052
I'm sorry, Octopus, but I'm not impressed.

295
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,847
I have to hurry and rescue Luffy.

296
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,349
Aniki, look out!

297
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,226
You fiend! How could you do that to Hachi?!

298
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:26,351
You fiend! How could you do that to Hachi?!

299
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:28,853
Bastard!

300
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,107
Yeah, you thought you'd gotten
rid of me that easily, eh?

301
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:36,653
Hm? I didn't think there was anyone
who could stand up to my punch,

302
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,988
not in all of East Blue.

303
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,282
Oh, I bet you'll find plenty who could.

304
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,619
Especially in a certain sea restaurant.

305
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,872
You've been fooled.

306
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,588
Aniki, don't move!

307
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:56,715
Hey, stop!

308
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,093
In your condition, your ass is as good
as dead if you go underwater.

309
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,387
Shut the hell up!

310
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:03,888
He's almost done for!

311
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:06,349
He can't wait for your fight to finish!

312
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,309
Yeah, I know about that.

313
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,021
I know there's no time left.

314
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,398
That's why I'm stopping you.

315
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,734
You're the one who should shut the hell up!

316
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,902
So you don't complain about me doing THIS!

317
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:23,783
Interesting! He wants to challenge
a merman in the water?

318
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,285
I've never met a bigger fool!

319
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,244
You dumbass!

320
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,748
An underwater battle is just what they want!

321
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,387
That's... l'm pretty sure he's the
head of Cocoyashi Village...

322
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,350
His neck's stretched out...

323
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,064
I'm sorry... this is all we can do to help.

324
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:57,817
This way, if we can at least get your head
out of the water, we can resuscitate you.

325
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,653
Come on, breathe, it's not too late yet!

326
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,614
Come on, l can't hold on much longer!

327
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:09,579
They couldn't move the stone,
so they moved his head.

328
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,874
They need me to break the stone to get him free.

329
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,918
Then that old man can take care of it from there.

330
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,672
Gyojin Karate, Wan Tou Giri!

331
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,305
This is getting interesting...

332
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,350
What do you humans intend to do next?

333
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:40,568
Come back to life...

334
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,950
Please, hurry!

335
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,664
He's so stubborn!!

1
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,280
He, Sir, we want to go on the celestial island!

2
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,319
Do you know something?

3
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
If it is the case…

4
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,879
The celestial island?!

5
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,000
But… the Log Poses point very right towards the sky!

6
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,000
Luffy!

7
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,489
Zoro! Wait one minute!

8
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,499
The farm!

9
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,460
This guy seeks the brawl and I will give it to him!

10
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,080
Luffy!

11
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,650
Bar you, band of larvae!

12
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,429
Luffy! Zoro!

13
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,620
This promise is forgotten! Put to them a beating!

14
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,820
We will not beat we.

15
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:47,950
A large pirate! The man who
speak about the dreams and the King about the Sonar

16
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,660
Look at! It holds always upright!

17
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,290
Clean the floor with this species of good-for-nothing!

18
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,900
This city does not need these cretins of dreamers!

19
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,459
It is what this din?

20
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,660
Bellamy and its band make a lynching as a public.

21
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,479
Luffy, Zoro!

22
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,860
What you foutez?! You can burst them!

23
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,909
Burst them!

24
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,170
Smash them! Foutez them a beating! It does not matter!

25
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,870
It is useless, young girl.

26
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,320
They are not insane.

27
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,650
When they are not size, they know it.

28
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,950
Never they would resist more extremely only them.

29
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,230
It is really pitiful.

30
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,190
I see that your Captain
really no dignity has.

31
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,419
The navy is too generous these times.

32
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,080
30 Million reward for a shit like him.

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,850
Zoro! We will not beat we.

34
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,380
Why do you do that?

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,850
Pacifism…

36
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,900
Ca must sound well with your ears.

37
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,560
In addition to being weaklings, you do not have any pride!

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,799
Even not able to take up a challenge…

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,720
And your heads are faggots of dreams!

40
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,639
That vers de terre!

41
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,550
You said it!

42
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,160
Enough, enough.

43
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,560
This kid seemed so weak, but with a premium of 30 Million on his head…

44
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,120
I wondered which kind of the type it was.

45
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,760
Then I was really disappointed, it is not worth a nail.

46
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,750
I ever saw a similar coward.

47
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,140
He, foutez to me these guys outside.

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,530
They are ugly.

49
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,729
Luffy!

50
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,200
Zoro!

51
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,840
He, my nice.

52
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,350
You will not survive
New Era while remaining with them.

53
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,490
I will buy to you.

54
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,910
Tell me your price!

55
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,460
I ask you for forgiveness?

56
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,350
You want to buy to me?

57
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,060
Ouais!

58
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,969
Come with us.

59
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,460
You will not be bored.

60
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,020
Unfortunately…

61
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,090
I am too well…

62
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,940
for a band of queers like you.

63
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,730
It is really expensive!

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,190
It is really a crew filled of morons!

65
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,900
Y' does not have any to catch up with the other!

66
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,199
Collect these deux-là and disappear from my sight!

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,020
While you are still in life.

68
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,590
Weaklings!

69
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,000
And do not return!

70
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,830
The celestial island exists.

71
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,430
They are really
famous these tarts with cherries!

72
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,540
You are still there, you?

73
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,390
You make the head, soeurette?

74
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,090
They are your friends who gained this combat.

75
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,020
Do Oh, you think of becoming stronger than us?

76
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,200
Our next meeting will be done
in the high layers of piracy.

77
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,950
And counterpart that you have to them
impetus was not badly either.

78
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,280
You do not miss a notch, young girl!

79
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,940
Zoro!

80
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,040
Luffy!

81
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,520
This “New Era” of which they speak, it is shit.

82
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,950
The time when pirates
dreamed is completed?! Hein?!

83
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,960
Oi!

84
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,230
What…

85
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,340
PEOPLE…

86
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
DREAMS WILL ALWAYS HAVE!

87
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,600
PAS VRAI?

88
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,940
He, Ho!

89
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,370
He the nut, why you mouths like that?

90
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,740
Is it is what this delirious on the dreams?

91
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,860
To exceed the others is not easy matter to achieve!

92
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,410
He lost the ball or what?!

93
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,170
What still? Ca becomes noisy outside.

94
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,319
Drop.

95
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,060
These goods with nothing surely must
to pass their frustration on the inhabitants.

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,240
Ouais!

97
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,270
Let us let laugh them!

98
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,730
On the road of the tops, there is
battles that one does not gain with the fists!

99
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,490
Follow-there!

100
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,830
Allons-y!

101
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,020
Ok…

102
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,770
Luffy.

103
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,700
Luffy!

104
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,570
Oh, one would say that I delayed you.

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,420
I see that you are in a hurry.

106
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,340
I hope that you will reach it.

107
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,260
The celestial island!

108
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,700
He, it surely knew some
thing about the celestial island.

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,179
It was which this type?

110
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,390
'Do not know.

111
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,560
It is not “this funny of type”.

112
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,730
What? Not “this funny of type”?

113
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,490
And… why?

114
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,779
They was “these funny types”.

115
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,810
A priori.

116
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,020
What do you want to say?

117
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,190
You want to say that this type has nakama?

118
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:45,999
Where that?

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,070
He, answer me!

120
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,920
Rum is particularly goûteux today!

121
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,289
Board!

122
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,230
Here!

123
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,919
Nail!

124
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,820
Here!

125
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,699
Board!

126
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,530
Here!

127
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,260
[Note:Ita = at the same time means “board” and “IEA”]

128
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,170
IEA!

129
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,660
Here!

130
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,660
Here…

131
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,139
Whore…

132
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,729
I do not stop saying it to them.

133
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,360
I am not carpenter, me.

134
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,619
But you are so skilful with your hands, Usopp!

135
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,829
It is true?!

136
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,229
It is my best asset!

137
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,409
One would make better buy a new boat.

138
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,670
PAS QUESTION!

139
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,260
YOU DO NOT ONLY KNOW
REPRESENT THIS BOAT!

140
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,319
But if, but yes.

141
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,089
You already said it to me hundred times.

142
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,230
It is a pretty girl of your village which it gave you, it is that?

143
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,240
But that will become dangerous
to sail under these conditions.

144
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,589
It is for that I repair it!

145
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,319
Come to help!

146
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,570
Spin to us a knack!

147
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,720
Repair? Ca?

148
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,630
It is right patching up.

149
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,059
THE FARM!

150
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,489
He, not badly this head, Usopp!

151
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,480
What, that?

152
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,180
THE FEEEERME!

153
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,179
With the fact, you want what to dine…

154
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,559
THE FARM!

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,900
I see that we are not hungry.

156
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,370
I will make the crystallized one of gulls.

157
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
One wants some!

158
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,929
One wants some!

159
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,029
Sanji-kun!

160
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,120
Please! one wants some!

161
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,070
Sanji-kun!

162
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:34,770
[Note:Sarubeji (ang. Salvage) = fishing out]

163
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,050
Sarubeji! Saru-Be-ji!

164
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,770
Sarubeji! Saru-Be-ji!

165
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,470
What is it that this boat?

166
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,219
Salvage!

167
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,450
This song…

168
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,280
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

169
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,780
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

170
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,420
L-L-Luffy, Zoro!

171
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,919
In what a state you are?!

172
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,220
How it occurred?!

173
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,350
Nami-san!

174
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,930
You do not have anything, Nami-san?!

175
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,900
A DOCTOR!

176
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,429
It is you! Will help them!

177
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,310
Oh!

178
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,650
Thus? How much monsters did you face?

179
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,079
Just a pirate.

180
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,190
It is nothing, the business is regulated.

181
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,200
Ouais.

182
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,970
Ca, it is you who it known as. Me I am in bad temper.

183
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,920
NOT BUT!! You could you
to defend nevertheless, I do not know me!

184
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,670
Not! You would have to shave this
whole city me to have mad!

185
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,700
It is not what you said at the beginning…

186
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,100
The MASTER KEY It IS the MASTER KEY!

187
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
Then does not bring back it! I strike you, me!

188
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,200
Is He, why so furious whereas it was not even wounded?

189
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,330
Good question.

190
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,729
With the fact!

191
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,920
You learned from the things on the celestial island?

192
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,529
The island

193
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:05,789
The island-C

194
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,129
The island-C them

195
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,420
Island-C-The-Te?

196
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,870
I do not want to intend some any more to speak!

197
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,570
Everyone burst to laugh
when I evoked the celestial island!

198
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,370
WHAT CA HAS OF SO FUNNY?!

199
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,309
Brothel, what that has of if…

200
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,109
Hissatsu Ketchup Boshi!

201
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,880
Guard Not…

202
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,780
And well, there is stir!

203
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,349
With what rhyme all this row?

204
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,189
Oh!

205
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,240
Welcome, Robin-chan!

206
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,429
Are you hungry?

207
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,129
Want you to take a bath?!

208
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,219
What is nine, Robin?

209
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,570
You went some share?

210
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,290
Yes, to buy clothing, vivres and to find infos on the celestial island.

211
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,670
It IS CA, ALL IS OF MT FAULT, ROBIN!

212
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,070
It is you who started with
us to speak about the celestial island!

213
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,270
Jumping Not!

214
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,470
If it does not exist, I balance you over edge!

215
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,520
He, Chopper!

216
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,790
Would be careful if you approach it for the moment…

217
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,149
In the final analysis, does not at all even approach it!

218
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,360
Nami had a hard day.

219
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,580
And here is, Captain.

220
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,420
Oh, a chart with the treasure!

221
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,629
He, a chart with the treasure.

222
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,980
It is where?

223
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,820
On the left, you can see the site of Mock Town, it is there that we are.

224
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,480
And on is the opposed side, there X, you see?

225
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,809
It would seem that one bet of Jaya lives over there.

226
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,580
Did one bet?

227
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,670
Its name is Montblanc Cricket.

228
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,580
It was exiled of Mock Town because it spoke about absurd dreams.

229
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,500
Which coincidence, you don't find?

230
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,519
Ok, let us see that!

231
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,209
Have-await a little, Luffy!

232
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,480
One cannot move for the moment!

233
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,069
Because these types…

234
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,670
He Chopper, you saw them you also,…

235
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,960
You foutez what, both?

236
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,090
I believed well that it was the end!

237
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,329
Shit, because of you I am exhausted.

238
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,809
But it is Nami which was…

239
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,629
WHAT?!

240
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,089
HOW I was?!

241
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,250
You will treat me too of moron me?!

242
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,859
Big Boss!

243
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,780
The plungers are ready with the action!

244
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,079
Avoided microphone!

245
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,919
OK!

246
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,620
Then it left for the Sonar!

247
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,889
Here the plunger Outang number 27!

248
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,219
Confirmed echo!

249
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,060
A fish bench is detected with 9:00!

250
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,670
According to their speed, they are herrings!

251
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,740
Perfect, this evening it is barbecue!

252
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,540
Plunger Outang number 24! Confirmed echo!

253
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,640
Sailing ship of small size in approach!

254
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,150
What? A sailing ship?

255
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,610
Which is its position?

256
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,390
Euh… it is with 12:00!

257
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,970
They are right in front of us!

258
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,159
Stop research!

259
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,650
Outangs plungers! Regain the ship!

260
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,000
Still funny of boat that here.

261
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,810
But it is not that which you believed, Usopp.

262
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,580
Remain more than to see whether it is better or worse.

263
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,189
However, they were indeed seen!

264
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,819
Not true?

265
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,570
Yes.

266
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,250
The type of the fishing out must
to really live on this island!

267
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,490
One saw them returning!

268
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,820
Bah, that does not disturb me to meet them again.

269
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,839
He, Ho! Frèrot, frèrot!

270
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,030
You would reduce well from up there!

271
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,420
Zut then, I wondered who you
were and my heart was beating wildly.

272
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,879
You ace a dirty mouth!

273
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,009
Be to you of which race?

274
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,769
I am human, head of anvil!

275
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,159
Cretins!

276
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,460
You never heard of Big Boss of Shoujou Pirates,

277
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,480
The King of the Sonar, Shoujou-sama?!

278
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,880
Do not irritate Big Boss!

279
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,800
The calm one, the calm one.

280
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,470
You seem to be pirates.

281
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,350
Do you know that Crocodile, one
from did the Seven Powerful Corsairs, fall?

282
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:34,170
And its place among them could return to me very well.

283
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,370
My heart beats at any speed when I think of it!

284
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,269
Did Ah ouais? You would like to belong to the Captains Corsairs?

285
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,530
And well, you want to know what I have of so incredible?

286
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,350
In 25 years of existence, I never cut myself the hair!

287
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,580
Then? Surprised Es you?

288
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,320
Be to you idiot.

289
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,259
Oh, I am surprised!

290
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,849
Dumb, our Big Boss is…

291
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,269
The calm one, the calm one.

292
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,210
Your answer makes beat my heart at any speed.

293
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,210
Listen to me well!

294
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,210
If you master keys by the tunnel of my
anger, you will find a sea of blood.

295
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,159
Ouais, it is well…

296
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,779
But one does not have that to make.

297
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,070
Then moves from there!

298
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,800
CRETIN INSOLATE!

299
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,940
THIS SEA EAST MY TERRITORY!

300
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,150
IF YOU WANT TO PASS, PAY THE TAX!

301
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,330
Its territory?

302
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,420
He tells the same thing as Masira.

303
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,619
What? He said that?

304
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,479
How?

305
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,679
Masira?

306
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,270
I have Masira of course?

307
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,800
Ouais, one released it.

308
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,329
But…

309
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,419
D-DEGAGE?!

310
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,690
You… released it?!

311
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,720
Big Boss!

312
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,560
FOR MY BROTHER…

313
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,320
He!

314
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,419
It was released, but…

315
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,240
He did not die!

316
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,550
SOUND WAVE!

317
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,240
[Note:Havoc = Devastator]

318
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,770
The boat, it…!

319
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
And then?

320
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,119
What it fout?

321
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,519
You should not do that on the bridge!

322
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,820
I do not know.

323
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,920
But it is hefty man, he destroys the boat with his voice.

324
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,520
It is too late! The boat leaves in crumbs!

325
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,169
Go, the guy!

326
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,070
There remain not planted, one draws!

327
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,850
YES!

328
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,989
, You hold are not more furious?

329
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,329
It rightly!

330
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,050
He, it emits sound waves.

331
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,949
A-A-A… Wait!

332
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,530
Oh!

333
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,439
There are troubles!

334
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,619
The sound waves also attack our boat!

335
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,630
They destroy all my repairs!

336
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,790
The hull was already of pieces!

337
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,090
ONE WILL LEAVE IN CRUMBS IF ONE REMAINS HERE!

338
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,269
Ahead all!

339
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,320
It is necessary to be put out of reach its voice!

340
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,070
And Ben, there I fell on the bottom!

341
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,070
This woman asked me,

342
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,710
“Where I can find this Cricket?”

343
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,669
She did not have cold with the eyes, this pullet!

344
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,529
You astonish me, it was really hefty man!

345
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,019
It was not natural!

346
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,529
It had arms which pushed everywhere!

347
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,120
It seized the whole bar! It was not the joy!

348
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,470
But what it can
to want well with the old Cricket?

349
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,570
This sea is the territory of the brothers simiens.

350
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,470
With his place, I would attend
not this damaged old man of too close…

351
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,120
Perhaps how its madness is contagious!

352
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,620
She surely does not want that!

353
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,240
She must have some after her gold.

354
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,019
Gold?

355
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,439
Ouaip, it appears that it found some.

356
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,919
Did Ah ouais, where that?

357
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,690
He, the guy!

358
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,600
Bellamy!

359
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,190
It is what this gold history?

360
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,670
This man, this Cricket…

361
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,620
I would like to meet it.

362
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,080
Look at this mop!

363
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,350
The island where we are.

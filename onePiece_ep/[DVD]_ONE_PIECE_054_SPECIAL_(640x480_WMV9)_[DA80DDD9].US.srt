1
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:17,660
Descent of Luffy!

2
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:17,660
The Adventure in the Closed Area

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,320
The will which survives.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,840
The spirit of time, and dreams of all humanity.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,760
Nobody can stop that.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,250
If the man seeks freedom,

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,870
then all this is inevitable.

8
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,290
1,2…

9
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,440
1,2…

10
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,210
Dumbs!

11
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,000
How do you dare to betray me?

12
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,290
Traitors!!

13
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,600
Stop doing that with starboard!

14
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,900
What will it arrive at fish if you do that?

15
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,890
They will be succulent.

16
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,650
It is what you believe!

17
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,020
One will have to wait how long?

18
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,020
It is strange…

19
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,500
Considering the quantity of soft foods which I did put, why I did not still fish anything?

20
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,790
It is not true! Why use you brushes as soft foods?

21
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,390
Don't Luffy, say to me which it is that use you?

22
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,110
If, that must be as good as a hamburger.

23
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,060
You are well the only one to think that of my opinion!

24
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,460
Super!! A fish!!

25
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,350
It is enormous!

26
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,670
I will see what it is…

27
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,630
He!

28
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,500
It is no matter what which you ace caught according to you?

29
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,940
A fish which likes the brushes.

30
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,000
Which idiot question.

31
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,600
Is that well?

32
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,970
What did it occur?

33
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,090
Nami-san.

34
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,380
It is what, that?

35
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,800
Is that eaten?

36
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,640
It is horrible, I do not want any!

37
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,180
Nami-san!

38
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,640
Does not throw it!
And if there were a treasure inside?

39
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,110
Considering the size it is not possible.

40
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,330
It is not a question of size.

41
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,990
I don't care.
If that is not eaten, I do not want any!

42
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,390
It is all considering.

43
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
It is open.

44
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,570
Is Nami, there what inside?

45
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,300
Let look at to me.

46
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,600
Of agreement, here.

47
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,190
Go…

48
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
It is a skeleton!

49
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,290
It is really not edible.

50
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,130
Water is in perpetual movement, and I ever heard a similar noise.

51
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,910
Which noise?

52
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,220
You should enter the navel of the sea.

53
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,580
Inside the treasures are of which you always dreamed. Jungo captain.

54
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,370
The navel of the sea?

55
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,510
You should enter there?

56
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,030
It is what?

57
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,830
It is what this cavity in the sea?

58
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,790
Inside the treasures are of which you always dreamed.

59
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,930
Jungo captain?

60
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,300
All will be with me this time.

61
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,350
Nami-san, let us carry out a happy life together.

62
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,670
It is very small here, does not smoke.

63
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,950
They is so good to be reprimand by the love of Nami-san!

64
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,080
Luffy, one goes down!

65
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,530
Yep!

66
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,810
Luffy, one entrusts the guard of the ship to you.

67
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,070
Of agreement, but I wanted to descend me too.

68
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,420
It is ridiculous.

69
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,540
I am hungry and I am thirsty.

70
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,440
What?

71
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,460
That resembles a drink for me.

72
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,060
Good appetite!

73
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,740
It is what?

74
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,020
You saw what?

75
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
Let see me.

76
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,740
Me also I want to see!

77
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,250
What can that be well?

78
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,230
Do Luffy, you hear that?

79
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,090
There is a gigantic cave in the navel of the sea.

80
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,110
One goes down now.

81
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,160
Do Luffy, you hear me?

82
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,560
Turn a little.

83
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,630
I repeat, one goes down.

84
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,500
Luffy, reduce to us low still!

85
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,360
Do Luffy, you hear?

86
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,940
Kills us, one made a great discovery.

87
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,520
Included/understood.

88
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,560
I cannot withdraw it.

89
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,260
Do Luffy, what you make?

90
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,050
One soon will be crushed!!

91
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,320
It is what that?

92
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,210
Me known as step that they all are of the pirates to the research of the treasures.

93
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,660
With my opinion, one should not trail here.

94
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,100
Who is this?

95
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,530
It is the cemetery of all the pirates.

96
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,380
You also, you will die here.

97
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,080
A bat…

98
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,220
… speaking!?

99
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,150
It is me here the guide.

100
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,210
You would make better leave.

101
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,540
Which is this noise?

102
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,320
What does it occur?

103
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,530
What arrives to you Nami-san? Why do you make this head?

104
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:46,340
Luffy, goes up us!
Quickly!!!

105
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,140
Luffy!

106
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,180
I believed to hear something. That must be my imagination.

107
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,730
Ah, what a good nap!

108
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,470
What do they have to howl like that?

109
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,660
How I leave it from there?

110
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,390
I will help you.

111
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,950
Thank you Zoro.

112
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,680
And here.

113
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,160
Zoro, you…

114
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,780
What is it that?

115
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,330
It is a letter?

116
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,190
Show.

117
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,870
You include/understand it?

118
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,050
Obviously.

119
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,700
Luffy!

120
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,920
Please!

121
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,820
Luffy, goes up us!!!

122
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,790
If it is like that.

123
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,370
One succeeded, one of it is drawn.
One will leave oneself there!

124
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,150
Where you take us along?

125
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
What is it?

126
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,570
One is taken with the trap! What to make?

127
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,720
You made cry Nami-san, I will not forgive yourself it.

128
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,270
One can count on him at least, it is not like certain…

129
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,230
You speak about who?

130
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,360
Luffy cost us our breakfast.

131
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,790
Nami-san, which would you say of an octopus for the lunch?

132
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,800
It was captured too.

133
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,830
And the octopus with the air in anger.

134
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,130
What occurs?

135
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,740
Oh not Luffy…

136
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:30,980
What?

137
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,800
Really…

138
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,830
Imbecile!

139
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,590
Course to the footbridge, Luffy!

140
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,940
Cling quickly to this rock!

141
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,900
One succeeded!

142
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Shit!

143
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,670
Why does that occur like that?

144
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,110
Zoro…

145
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,200
I am really burst.

146
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,060
Luffy…

147
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,620
Do Sanji, you can more what make?

148
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,070
That me has all the air of it…

149
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,310
It is what?

150
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,620
It occurred what?

151
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,980
It is the Vogue-Merry!

152
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,240
You see it?

153
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,800
That made party of our plan!

154
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,500
What?

155
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,570
What makes Luffy and the other?

156
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,480
Dispatch we to find the treasure.

157
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,500
A treasure?

158
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,160
Good, there are not time to lose.

159
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,780
Nami-san.

160
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,050
You can go there in first?

161
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,150
I will catch up with you in a wink.

162
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,400
Why?
Be sure for you that goes?

163
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,830
Yes.

164
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,600
Allons-y, Nami!

165
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,720
Luffy is not on board.

166
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,420
Let us leave the boat here.

167
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,900
You will be awaited Sanji-kun.

168
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,940
You must cling.

169
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,260
I cannot move really any more.

170
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,030
Hamu, and if you do get caught?

171
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,090
What can one make there?

172
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,550
Please, gives up!

173
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,030
Even if somebody manages to recover a message,

174
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,260
one could not be saved.

175
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,410
Our destiny was sealed 10 years ago
when we decided to remain here.

176
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,550
Although we did not find peace,

177
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,670
everyone was committed continuing its current life.

178
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,980
I do not want!

179
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,690
I do not want…

180
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,850
I do not want to be tortured like Mero.

181
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,220
I have enough of this life of it!

182
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,420
Who is this?

183
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,280
Who are you?

184
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,090
Somebody… with the assistance!

185
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,240
This… letter…

186
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,450
They is good.
You can rise?

187
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,760
I should be able.

188
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,230
Hamu, returns to you util!

189
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,250
Run!

190
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,630
In… Incredible!

191
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,350
Die!

192
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,300
Super! You really came to save us.

193
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,190
I am burst, I will lie down.

194
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,360
He, you two.

195
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,450
You really came to save us?

196
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,160
You came for this letter.

197
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,740
You speak about that?

198
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,080
Yes.

199
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,980
What did it write there above?

200
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,030
I do not include/understand it.

201
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,600
And you?

202
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,490
Do not ask me.

203
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
Please, for which reason did you really come?

204
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,270
We fell.

205
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,110
Fallen?

206
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,580
Yes, whereas we seek a treasure.

207
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,080
A treasure?
Then you are…

208
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,730
Yes, of the pirates!

209
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,810
Finally pirate apprentices.

210
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,910
Pirates?
Pirates?

211
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,670
Who y' has?

212
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,780
We thought that you would fight at our sides.

213
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,920
You did not come to help us?

214
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,200
Then… you are only pirates!

215
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,900
Hamu!

216
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,530
What does it have, him?

217
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,990
Please, I ask you to leave at once.

218
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,130
We hate the pirates.

219
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,230
All here, we hate them.

220
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,830
You saved us.

221
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,010
The pirates also know gratitude.

222
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,550
What occurs?

223
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,090
Say it to us, please.

224
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,100
Heard.

225
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,920
You have the strong air.

226
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,230
That made 10 years.

227
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,290
The first pirate to arrive here was…

228
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,090
the Jungo Captain.

229
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,520
I intended some to speak.

230
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,370
Good Ah?

231
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,740
It stole all the richnesses of the city.

232
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,620
It is even…

233
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,000
party with the legendary dormant mountain crowned,

234
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,710
and it succeeded in offending the gods.

235
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,080
What did it occur then?

236
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,780
I do not know!

237
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,210
I do not want the knowledge either.

238
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,140
What arrived to the Jungo Captain does not look at us,

239
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,130
whether it found the treasure or that it died.

240
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,800
Because the monsters which it released,

241
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,230
we plunged in one decade of misery.

242
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,130
This life does not have anything free…

243
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,110
One can count only on ourself to survive.

244
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,960
And…

245
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,000
we hate the pirates for what they did to us.

246
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,520
It is like that.

247
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,190
Does Y' have another monster in top of the mountain?

248
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,990
Then there is not only that which I killed.

249
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,970
He! You, two pirates,

250
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,230
you could save us…

251
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,750
Completely. And then one benefitted well from your food.

252
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,350
Perhaps she wants that one will seek his companion.

253
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,400
You speak about Hamu.

254
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,670
Ham?
Ham or melon?

255
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,980
It lost his mother.

256
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,060
And after that, I am occupied.

257
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,770
The mother of Hamu was the queen of this city.

258
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,030
She was with the current for a long time for the pirates and the fate which had been broken,

259
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
and for all that had arrived in this city.

260
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,380
Then, it is assembled at the top of the mountain to kill Jungo.

261
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,830
But it never returned since.

262
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,680
This is why Hamu wants to avenge his/her mother.

263
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,380
And thus, he seeks somebody to come to help it with vanger.

264
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,150
Yes.

265
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,990
It is stupid.

266
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,750
Completely.
He is insane.

267
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,590
He seeks a dead pirate years ago.

268
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,590
This Jungo Captain already died?

269
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,480
Didn't I say you not to interfere you?

270
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,030
But however, his laughter is always heard.

271
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,820
We are there.

272
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,910
The treasure is in top of the mountain.

273
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,470
Really?

274
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,930
It is easy.

275
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,040
On the contrary.

276
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,550
What?

277
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:53,610
To obtain the treasure, you must overcome two monstrous animals.

278
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,420
What you say?!

279
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,640
Moron.

280
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,450
Why you did not speak about it front?

281
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,690
You asked me anything.

282
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,910
We reached this place.

283
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,150
Where thus did Luffy pass?

284
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,840
Allons-y!

285
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,940
There remain nothing any more but us now two.

286
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,570
The way stops here.

287
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,050
The mountain is right in front.

288
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,800
Is Luffy, one really obliged to go there?

289
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,580
Ouais, I want to see this Jungo Captain.

290
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,910
If it in life, then that is always made ten years

291
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,830
that it is on the track of the treasure.

292
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,100
And then…

293
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,610
I filled the paunch already well.

294
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:03,710
Exact.

295
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,330
Push yourself!

296
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,450
Does Zoro, that go?

297
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,250
Take that!

298
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,450
Stop!

299
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,660
This monster…

300
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,820
It is with me.

301
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,710
Luffy, you can continue all alone.

302
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,710
Of agreement.

303
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,130
Afflicted.

304
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,790
Good blood, these swords are not very useful.

305
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,970
Good!

306
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,560
I go there!

307
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,040
I must hurry!

308
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:20,920
Hamu.

309
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,830
It is…

310
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,130
We are there.

311
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,290
Yes.

312
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,840
Here the famous hollow one.

313
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,000
This… this cellar…
do not only say to me…

314
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,240
it is a labyrinth?

315
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,520
Completely.

316
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,340
The treasure must be in the medium.

317
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,030
It is that, is necessary that one arrives there.

318
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,250
It is cake.

319
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,580
If one loses oneself in a labyrinth, it is enough to turn back,

320
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,610
and to seek the right track.

321
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,080
It is at least necessary to be able to leave.

322
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,180
What?

323
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,050
He Ussop, somebody arrives.

324
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,210
Quickly, course!

325
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,310
One is saved.

326
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,280
Ussop, why you have…

327
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,080
Do not precipitate anyhow!

328
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,180
Why?
Because…

329
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,180
Course!!

330
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,590
I do not arrive there.

331
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,860
A sword…

332
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,290
There are so many swords here.

333
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,030
Thank you.

334
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,040
This place is very interesting.

335
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,860
It left!

336
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,290
Why, why you want that I carry you?

337
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,310
Your mouth!

338
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,000
Let us leave quickly!
On the left, on the left!!

339
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,370
I included/understood!

340
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,280
On the left, left, left…

341
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,700
left, left…

342
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,240
Right-hand side!

343
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,050
Right-hand side…

344
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
One reconsidered our steps.

345
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,260
It is not my fault.

346
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,660
Where you go?!

347
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,180
Behind you!

348
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,370
Course!

349
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,720
It is what that?

350
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,870
Why isn't there more way?

351
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,780
It is for that I had you
asked to leave!!!

352
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,660
It is odd, why they are all died?

353
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,560
About what you speak, stunned?!

354
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,320
Look behind you!

355
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,130
Behind…

356
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,150
I know.

357
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,030
It is you who did that.

358
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,780
IEA… course now!

359
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,030
Luffy!

360
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,950
Beautiful job!

361
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,080
What you insane?

362
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,880
Hurry!

363
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,960
I cannot rise.

364
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,260
You do not want to seek your friend?

365
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,220
Of course that if.

366
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:17,250
Then shows me initially,
what you ace in the belly.

367
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,750
And shows me then the talents of your companions!

368
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,100
You want to see that of which I am able?

369
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,350
Ouais, shows me.

370
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,750
Course!

371
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
Then, for research…

372
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,940
It is that.

373
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,360
It is finished.

374
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,930
Beautiful job.

375
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,890
But you ace taken a long time.

376
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,740
Was necessary to let me make.

377
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,850
Really…

378
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,440
You arrive too late in any case.

379
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,080
Fortunately that I was there to help.

380
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,290
Miss.

381
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,440
You are wounded?

382
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,520
Not.

383
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,520
In fact it…

384
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,830
If you want it, one could dine together.

385
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,230
It is not the moment to think of having fun!

386
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,750
If they were able to remove me from the last monster guard,

387
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,010
I could finally become again myself.

388
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,670
Ussop, it is there.

389
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,340
Do not only say to me…

390
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,520
Exact.

391
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,450
Super, the treasure was found.

392
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,180
What?

393
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,530
Wait a little…

394
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,120
Wait.

395
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,380
What, be to you really shitting you!

396
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,650
It is necessary that you will kill the last monster!

397
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,780
And why you speak to me like that?

398
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,850
And why not.

399
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,390
The treasure is, right there in front of us.

400
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,170
Who dictated these rules?

401
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,710
It is…

402
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,090
Look at.

403
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,590
Somebody is there to wish you the welcome.

404
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,770
Who are you?

405
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,370
I have them all exploded!!!

406
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,390
Luffy?

407
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,770
Captain!?

408
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,780
Jungo!

409
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,940
Do Ussop, you await what?
Dispatch we to take it!

410
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,580
Of agreement.

411
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,500
An explosive bullet?

412
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,020
That is there, my body is finally reconstituted.

413
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,960
It had however been separate in several parts.

414
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,970
My body….

415
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,950
I will never have believed that you would succeed in with me bringing back it.

416
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,670
Thanks to you, I am again in life.

417
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,050
He, you have really the pitiful air.

418
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,110
It is true, I was abused!

419
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,590
By you all!

420
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,530
It is perfect now, you are all died.

421
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,370
But I am different.

422
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,920
I lived in the shape of a bat during one decade

423
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,220
for this moment…

424
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,720
I finally will carry out my dream.

425
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,890
To find the secrecy of the navel of the sea!

426
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,470
Jungo!!!

427
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,800
Who?

428
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,860
You have much chance, you know?

429
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,280
I have full with ammunition.

430
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,190
Jungo!

431
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,070
Hamu!

432
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,950
I did not think that some would have courage to rebel.

433
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,760
Your face is not unknown for me…

434
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,500
I see!
You are this kid.

435
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,640
Then, the kid, returned to you.

436
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,670
You grew.

437
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,900
And you want to avenge your mother?

438
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:26,590
This courageous heart which dared to defy me?

439
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,520
Really?
I will show you…

440
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,950
how it finished.

441
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,050
Here what occurred.

442
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,340
Look at.

443
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,440
Not!!!

444
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,520
I came vanger my mother!

445
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:57,580
Hamu.

446
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,060
Mom fought for the good of the village.

447
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,550
But she knew her force.

448
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,200
Then, I went sought companions

449
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,250
to assist me in this combat.

450
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,210
And like my mother, I will fight for the village.

451
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,080
Companions?

452
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,390
And where are they thus?

453
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,680
Look around you, they are all died.

454
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,220
There are only you and me.

455
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,130
Come, that made one decade that I wait.

456
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,540
Let us regulate that good once for all.

457
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,430
We will see which us two will survive.

458
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,500
Mom, gives me courage.

459
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,060
Grant to me the will to fight.

460
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,230
It is what this light?

461
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,860
Would you be…

462
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,470
Impossible…

463
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,930
How this is possible…

464
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,960
You have so many companions?

465
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,570
I would have liked me well too.

466
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,010
I succeeded…

467
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,750
I succeeded, mom.

468
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,610
What arrives to you?

469
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,290
You are except, then does not cry.

470
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,090
I cry of joy

471
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,330
because you fought at my sides.

472
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,990
I did not help you…

473
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,990
All that I want, it is the treasure.

474
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,020
There is nothing.

475
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,400
The treasure does not exist.
Where is it?

476
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,810
Is He, where the treasure?

477
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,990
That scintillated presently.

478
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,230
One flies!!

479
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,670
Lastly, they set out again.

480
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,020
And I do not even know their names.

481
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:13,770
It is of no importance.

482
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,940
They are pirates.

483
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,510
Exact, they are pirates.

484
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,450
I would become the Lord of the Pirates!

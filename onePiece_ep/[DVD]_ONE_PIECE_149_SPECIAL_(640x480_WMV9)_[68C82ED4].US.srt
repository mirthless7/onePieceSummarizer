1
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:10,185
The world… Yes!

2
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:16,745
It is the research of freedom,
the ideal world being right in front of you.

3
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:20,565
If this dream without end is your guide,

4
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:25,555
then passes in addition to the symbol of the Faith!

5
00:01:57,065 --> 00:02:01,195
Well, this should bring happiness to you.

6
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:05,515
It is all that I can do for you.

7
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:07,505
Forgive me.

8
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,775
Frankly, Zap Captain,

9
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,785
this mission is really easy.

10
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:20,745
One was just to capture these kids.

11
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:26,395
They are perhaps kids,
but they have value.

12
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:38,045
Now one can announce the good news with the owner.

13
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,335
The dumbs, they have fun the festival.

14
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,085
I can of it more this job.

15
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,985
Is necessary to resign.

16
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:01,605
What do you tell?

17
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:04,645
One is able to be made money,
then why one would drop?

18
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:07,835
It is true…

19
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,765
He! You two!

20
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:18,125
You are still awaked?
Is necessary to sleep!

21
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:20,985
Tomorrow, one will see the owner.

22
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:25,425
You take us along with you?

23
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:27,635
I will not let to you do that for nothing.

24
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:30,645
I will reveal you a secrecy.

25
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,415
You want money, not?

26
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:37,375
If one is able to draw from here into soft,
I show you the hiding-place of a large treasure.

27
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,015
It is a good arrangement.

28
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:52,175
The kids slipped by!
It is Bonny and Marcus!

29
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:56,495
These incompetents!!
How do they dare to betray us?

30
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,825
Find them quickly! Find them!

31
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:03,695
We must bring back them!!!

32
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:17,195
To explore the ocean!

33
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:17,195
The great dream of my father!

34
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:20,545
The weather is good.

35
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:21,795
Really?

36
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,315
The ocean is very calm,

37
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:25,935
we are perhaps in spring.

38
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,695
It is not a reason.

39
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,035
It is too easy, you do not believe?

40
00:04:31,115 --> 00:04:32,025
Captain?

41
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:40,395
He Luffy, do not make fall fishing cane.

42
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,575
Luffy! I had warned you!!

43
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,655
Will seek it!
Immediately!!!

44
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:54,715
Well.

45
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:00,505
You want my death?

46
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,465
He sleeps really anywhere.

47
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:05,355
With this time, it is normal.

48
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,655
Leave it quiet.
In the event of problem, it is always there.

49
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:13,555
I am not sure…

50
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,665
The weather is splendid!

51
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,215
An island?

52
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:31,575
What is there?
Amanda!

53
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,045
I am sure that they are pirates.

54
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,005
But it is not Zap.

55
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:37,785
What does one make?

56
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:41,955
One can nothing make
as long as the treasure was not found.

57
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:43,305
You are only one idiot.

58
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,985
A treasure… or life.
Which is most important?

59
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,365
It is…

60
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:51,105
Listen, if it is not to me Zap,
one will be able to perhaps find a solution.

61
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,725
Listen to, made what I say to you.

62
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,255
This island is really splendid.

63
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,285
There is nobody here, one would say.

64
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,735
One will be able to rest.

65
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,875
Would not be so sure.

66
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:12,175
Perhaps that people hide in the forest.

67
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:14,075
There are perhaps aboriginals on this island.

68
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:15,485
What?

69
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:20,695
Who are you?

70
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:21,955
You identify!

71
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,895
One did nothing of evil!

72
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:28,285
We are only one small family which comes to make camp-site here.

73
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:29,435
A family?

74
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:33,985
Holly!

75
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:46,105
That made one month that one camps here.

76
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:47,325
Yes.

77
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:51,345
My parents wanted to take holidays before it is too hot.

78
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,495
Holidays?

79
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:56,215
What have you made for one month?

80
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,255
One fishes and one catches butterflies.

81
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,545
You have fun with the play of survival?

82
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,945
And your dad?
What does it make?

83
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:04,575
Us?

84
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,305
A treasure is sought.

85
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,045
That hurt!

86
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:09,795
A treasure?

87
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,665
He wants to say something of edible,

88
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:13,525
to survive this play of survival.

89
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,335
Food, it is a true treasure.

90
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:16,535
What…

91
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:18,185
You are called Milia?

92
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:19,945
It is funny the camp-site?

93
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:20,535
Eh…

94
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:22,335
Yes…

95
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,235
Heu…

96
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:29,075
You are pirates?

97
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:32,355
Yes. You are afraid?

98
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,335
Not really…

99
00:07:34,925 --> 00:07:39,355
We are adventurous pirates.

100
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:45,335
We are different from the other pirates.

101
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,475
If that interests you,

102
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,965
I can tell you a heap of adventures

103
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:51,835
that we lived.

104
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:52,235
Stop!

105
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,805
Afflicted, I…

106
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:06,715
I am sorry…
It is in full puberty.

107
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:09,915
Yes.

108
00:08:13,345 --> 00:08:14,205
Stop!

109
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,875
I am not edible!

110
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:22,105
Wait, panda!!

111
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:22,875
I am a reindeer!

112
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:30,825
Amanda.

113
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,065
I want to leave to the adventure.

114
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:36,865
Dad will find a treasure which will be worth a fortune.

115
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,025
You will see!

116
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,435
I do not need any treasure,

117
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,775
I want simply to remain with you.

118
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,775
Dad!!

119
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,145
Which kind of adventures?

120
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,835
Captain, awakes!

121
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:12,785
The enemy is of exit.

122
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:21,555
It is Robin, something arrived.

123
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,375
Captain… I caught it.

124
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,615
We found the kid.

125
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,695
Well. Return quickly.

126
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:29,995
Big sister!

127
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,875
Wait… lets make me.

128
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,645
Slacken me.

129
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,305
Wait…

130
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,285
I discovered a strange ship of pirates.
I had never yet seen it.

131
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:42,135
Take guard!

132
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,395
Well, it is noted.

133
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,655
Who are devil?
They are the malicious ones?

134
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:56,835
I know anything of it, but they do not have
the intention to leave well nicely.

135
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,135
Chopper!

136
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:00,825
Awake Luffy.

137
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:01,965
It is a super urgency!

138
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:02,785
Included/understood!

139
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,525
I hold you, band of dumbs!

140
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,685
What you insane, moron?

141
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:25,615
Zoro!!!

142
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,655
What you cards here?

143
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:31,925
I lost myself while walking me.

144
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:35,195
I walked along the coast.

145
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,445
But what do you tell?

146
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,355
I was mistaken by your fault!

147
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,385
Shit!

148
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,985
All is of your fault…

149
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:44,035
What?

150
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,795
Wait… They remove the young girl!

151
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:52,815
What?

152
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:56,345
He! Luffy is odd,
not average to awake it!

153
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,225
What do you make?

154
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,095
I am too nice or what?

155
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:02,905
One brought back it to edge.

156
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:04,365
Prepare the guns!

157
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,585
Something bell.

158
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,555
They will attack.

159
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,405
Qu… which can one make?

160
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,095
No… our plan fall to water.

161
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:17,145
Let us drop the treasure,
and we draw from here.

162
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,105
It is too late now.

163
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:23,935
I wonder what they will do in Amanda.

164
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:25,905
It is necessary that a solution is found.

165
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:50,795
Upright!!!

166
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,875
Luffy!! Rise.

167
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,345
Does the enemy approach, you include/understand?

168
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,145
Made fire!

169
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:15,395
Go… Luffy.

170
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,015
Awake!

171
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:21,235
What?

172
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:26,775
Luffy!!

173
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:29,925
Captain!

174
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:31,705
It is which this type?

175
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,365
Captain, of the nerve!

176
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:34,955
Not, it is dying.

177
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:36,465
What does it occur?

178
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,595
Captain!

179
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,085
Which disaster…

180
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,555
How you ace which been able to do that, dumb?

181
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,725
Te does not appear that one will forgive you so easily!

182
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,965
We will say it to the owner!

183
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,025
One can go there now?

184
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,375
He, Luffy was taken along.

185
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,805
Ahhh not!

186
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:56,085
What makes Zoro and Sanji?
The moment is critical!

187
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:57,965
It is true.

188
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:01,065
But we are not
able to occupy us of them.

189
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,395
We must trust Luffy.

190
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:05,505
They are not continued?

191
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:06,365
Not…

192
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:08,085
Impossible…
One cannot do that.

193
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,845
If one leaves Amanda to the hands of Baian,
what will it arrive to him?

194
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,035
You know these pirates?

195
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:20,345
You explain!
And in details, please.

196
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,735
If that is not appropriate to me,
you could regret it.

197
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,225
Go.

198
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,985
To be useless in such a situation…

199
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,785
If you are not there when it is necessary,
for what are used you?

200
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,245
Luffy also was useless for him!

201
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:45,855
But its sleep was really not normal.

202
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:47,185
Cock-San,

203
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,175
it is not because of what you put in our meal?

204
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,645
It is him which is responsible for what one eats,

205
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,085
how could it?

206
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:57,495
I wanted just that it is a little calmer,
then I put sleeping pill.

207
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:58,735
Why you ace does that?

208
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,095
But I put of it only one small amount.

209
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,825
Yes, but that can be too much much for
somebody who does not have the practice.

210
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:08,065
Good, what do you hide?

211
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,635
Forgiveness.

212
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,185
Bonny and me let us belong to this group of pirates.

213
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:18,535
We captured Amanda because it holds
the secrecy of a fabulous treasure.

214
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,885
I am sorry…

215
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,335
The calm one.

216
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:26,675
You want to say…
something of other that food?

217
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,165
A true treasure?

218
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,055
Yes.

219
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,205
Does Amanda know the secrecy?

220
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:32,075
Yes.

221
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:35,275
Why not have said it to us as of the beginning?

222
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,435
The poor…

223
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:42,125
I think that they will return.

224
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,055
Milia-Chan.

225
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,155
The treasure is hidden on this island,

226
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,705
thus if our sister speaks,

227
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,565
they surely will return.

228
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,785
Is the treasure on this island?

229
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:54,705
Yes.

230
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,175
It has been for that one camps here for a month,

231
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:58,795
it is to find the treasure.

232
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,005
But it is not easy.

233
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:04,985
We did not can anything have made without Amanda.

234
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:07,635
That hurt!

235
00:15:08,835 --> 00:15:11,145
After you.
It is a little seedy character.

236
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:14,985
That resembles it in what more
lived the prehistoric men.

237
00:15:16,255 --> 00:15:17,805
It is because one built it with goes-quickly.

238
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:19,065
Come quickly.

239
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:24,335
It is well, hein?
You do not believe?

240
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:28,605
You really dug very deep.

241
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,565
And all that in one month?

242
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:34,755
It is because one was justified,

243
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,525
one dug for the treasure.

244
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,925
But alas, one found nothing.

245
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,995
It is thus for that one uses it as dwelling.

246
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:42,605
Drives out it with the treasure?

247
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:46,675
But how it is made that these kids
know the existence of a treasure?

248
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:51,075
It is because the father of Amanda is one
hunter of professional treasure.

249
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,495
The true father of Amanda?

250
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:54,115
Yes.

251
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:58,415
Their father found the treasure,
and when it returned at his place,

252
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,305
it had wounds mortals.

253
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:05,945
It had much evil to reveal in Amanda
where the treasure was hidden.

254
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:09,415
Amanda said that it was on this island.

255
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:10,675
I am sure.

256
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:12,665
It is really on this island?

257
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,335
She would not have told you tall stories?

258
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:17,485
Not… it is the truth.
Hein Milia?

259
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:19,095
Yes.

260
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:25,985
Dad said that it had started from Mamana towards Samua, and that the island with the treasure was on the road.

261
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:31,145
One followed the way of Samua shown by
Eternal Poses, and we arrived here.

262
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,815
Thus I am sure that it is well here.

263
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,245
But there must be much other islands between the two.

264
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,055
You do not have the air very not convinced.

265
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:44,365
You think that an innocent child could lie us?

266
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,055
Did I say that?

267
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:49,475
Is Amanda well of her family?

268
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,145
Yes.

269
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:55,375
Then, which could be the treasure that Amanda hiding place?

270
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:56,165
Hein?

271
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,155
It is the secrecy of the treasure.

272
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:01,035
Yes.

273
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:04,955
But it is all that I know.

274
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:08,745
He Nami!
It is really nice of your share.

275
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:12,495
Even if you find this treasure,
it belongs to them.

276
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,305
You heard them…

277
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,155
Not Zoro…

278
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:18,015
I know what I do,

279
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,385
I like to render service to people.

280
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:24,395
Liar! Your face says that you are interested only in the money.

281
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:25,735
It is true.

282
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,715
I think that it is not a problem,

283
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:33,215
because my big sister makes fun well of the treasure.

284
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:34,785
Really?

285
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:35,325
Look at.

286
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,135
That shines!

287
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,245
Incredible, it resplendit!

288
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,085
It is possible that a person resplendisse like that?

289
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:42,935
My eyes!

290
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:47,205
But… we must divide with Marcus.

291
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:50,015
No problem,
that must really be a fabulous treasure.

292
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,075
You are sure that goes?

293
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,675
Your father left it to you.

294
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,755
My big sister does not like the adventures and drives out with the treasures.

295
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:02,015
Dad adored that.

296
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,305
But because of that, my sister very only felt.

297
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,275
Milia, and you?

298
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:08,485
I…

299
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,155
I love my sister,

300
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,815
and I love my father.

301
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:18,395
Me too!

302
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,465
It is me which loves more the dad!

303
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:23,825
Look at, dad gave me that!

304
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,015
Oh! This collar is splendid.

305
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,995
I am hungry.

306
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,445
Holly, is looked at…

307
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,965
Very well, one will eat now.

308
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:43,475
Holly, come to help me.

309
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,715
I am where?

310
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:52,935
What occurs?
Why I am attached?

311
00:18:53,385 --> 00:18:54,765
Lastly, you awake.

312
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:56,255
Be to you which you?

313
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,405
I am called Amanda.

314
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:02,025
One was captured by pirates.

315
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,185
My hat! Where is my hat?

316
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:04,875
You me listenings?

317
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:07,815
You saw my hat? My hat?

318
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:09,255
Not.

319
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,375
You did not have while arriving it here.

320
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:14,915
It is not true!
Is necessary that I find my hat!

321
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:18,145
Your friends had to keep it with them.

322
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,485
My friends?
I include/understand!

323
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:22,415
Heu… Where are they?

324
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:26,255
Keep silent yourself…
They remained on the island where we were.

325
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:29,885
An island…
You know where it is?

326
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:30,995
Yes.

327
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,585
Très bien, allons-y tout de suite.

328
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,325
If it were so easy, I will have already done it.

329
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,585
We are prisoners.

330
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,565
You believe that one can from go away like that?

331
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,395
Y' does not have reason!
I will not remain here!

332
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:44,095
I go there.

333
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,885
It would be said that we arrived.

334
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,685
You had to wait a long time?

335
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:02,205
When did you arrive on the island of Mamana?

336
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:05,385
That made one month, where had you passed?

337
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:07,835
I am sorry.

338
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:11,545
The reason is strange.
The island did not have a magnetic field.

339
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,675
They hid over there,

340
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:16,425
then that took time to me.

341
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,185
Without magnetic field?

342
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:21,785
The island of Mamana is not it on the way

343
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,715
island of Samua?

344
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:26,925
Yes, it is exact.

345
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:28,895
It is that!

346
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:31,785
The treasure is hidden over there!

347
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:36,965
Bring the young girl!

348
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:40,515
Pirates of Baian, ahead!

349
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,755
Ahead all!

350
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:03,145
The treasure awaits us.

351
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:05,995
What know you?

352
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,685
I brought it here.

353
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,815
Why are you with the current?
It is supposed being a secrecy between Milia and me.

354
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:15,265
Te here.

355
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,505
I wanted to see you.

356
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,315
You are the girl of this type?

357
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,375
You know my father?

358
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:30,115
Of course.
Your father was one of my friends.

359
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,195
It is for that I am with the current for this island.

360
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:37,605
Es you of agreement to show me the chart?

361
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:42,015
You over there…
Be to you which?

362
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:44,665
When are you escaped?

363
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:45,675
Captain.

364
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:48,385
This type damaged my boat.

365
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:49,545
Idiot.

366
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:51,545
You cannot only charge you?

367
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:54,555
It is because…
I believe that he ate a Fruit of the Demon…

368
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:56,225
What? A Fruit of…

369
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:58,215
It is you the Captain?

370
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:00,225
You can bring back for us with your boat?

371
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:03,115
I want to find my friends.

372
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:04,305
Your friends?

373
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:05,465
Yes.

374
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:09,715
Its crew is on the island where we go.

375
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:12,775
Someone else with
special competences?

376
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,625
I will undertake some now.

377
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:20,955
He!

378
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:26,235
Do not worry you, the boat moves towards the island.

379
00:22:26,485 --> 00:22:27,465
Really?

380
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,055
This type wants more in connection with the treasure.

381
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:35,525
It is necessary that they lower their guard before our attack is launched.

382
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:41,655
Eh Ben then, these types are not malicious.

383
00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:43,515
Fortunately.

384
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,715
I thought that Luffy was there,
then I prepared full to eat.

385
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:54,915
You thus will have to eat more.

386
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,315
I undertake some!!

387
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,335
No the problem!

388
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:02,995
You did something over there?

389
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:04,925
Nothing presses.

390
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:08,165
It is a new weapon which us
manufactured Chopper and me.

391
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:10,745
You will be able to throw an eye there before our next combat.

392
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,735
You will see…

393
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:15,595
It is really succulent.

394
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:20,975
Listen to me!!!

395
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,615
It is me which prepared shrimps.

396
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:21,495
They is super.

397
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:22,605
You said?

398
00:23:22,755 --> 00:23:23,665
Drop…

399
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:27,995
They is very good.

400
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,685
Eh? Where is the small one?

401
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,365
Eh?

402
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:35,585
It was there, it helped me.

403
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:45,305
Aren't Milia-chan, you hungry?

404
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:46,675
Sanji-San.

405
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:48,685
You worry for your sister?

406
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,115
Yes.

407
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:57,805
Sanji-San… A treasure
really fortune brings?

408
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:00,735
I do not have any idea of it.

409
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:07,575
Dad sought it because of us.

410
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:08,765
But…

411
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,925
Setting with share fortune,

412
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:14,275
we did not cease being the target of the pirates.

413
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:20,725
Thus our sister forever intended to live thanks to the treasure.

414
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:27,125
But, we have only troubles because of him. I do not like that.

415
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:30,195
It is not that, a fortunate life.

416
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:33,775
It is an delicate subject…

417
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:36,485
But… Milia-chan.

418
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:41,075
Sometimes the human beings must
to fight to protect something.

419
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:44,925
It is what your father tried to bequeath you.

420
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:46,885
You cannot forget it.

421
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:50,425
You do not resemble a pirate, Sanji-San.

422
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:52,115
It is strange.

423
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:58,135
I am well a pirate, but I am
especially a chief-cook.

424
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:01,145
Well… Is necessary to eat now
before that is not cold.

425
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:01,785
Of agreement.

426
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,125
Milia… come!

427
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,055
This dish is delicious.

428
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,465
Taste my shrimps, soeurette.

429
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:11,785
Hurry, it nothing any more will remain.

430
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:26,665
But it is which this type?

431
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:28,425
A monster.

432
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,175
Heu… Captain.

433
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:33,935
We do not have any more a vivres.

434
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:35,175
What does one make?

435
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:36,275
What?

436
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:42,075
Stop cooking, or then we will die of hunger!

437
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:44,505
Send the music, we set out again!

438
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:46,745
Everyone in position!

439
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,645
Yes!

440
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:58,695
Who has there…

441
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:43,605
Qu… that does occur?
I cannot move any more.

442
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:47,575
What you made?

443
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:55,325
What do you think of the symphony that we play?

444
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:58,435
What you made?
You are not nice?

445
00:26:58,855 --> 00:27:00,765
In your dreams.

446
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:02,665
How did you dare to damage my boat?

447
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,075
I will not forgive it to you.

448
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:06,765
A boat?
About what you do speak?

449
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:07,895
Detach me!!

450
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:09,215
Idiot.

451
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:14,385
I do not save anybody who is
with the current for the treasure.

452
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:15,765
A treasure?

453
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,965
Even if you ate a Fruit of the Demon,

454
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,845
our music will control you.

455
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,265
As envisaged.

456
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,745
As for your father, Amanda…

457
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:30,385
You said that you were his friend!
You lied.

458
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:32,895
Not… we are friendly.

459
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:35,975
Did idiot, you really believe it?

460
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:42,655
Your father was an idiot,
he refused to speak to me about the treasure.

461
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:47,445
He said that it was not easy to find great fortune.

462
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:50,665
He said to me:
“I will not give it to anybody”.

463
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:52,765
He impressed me.

464
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,785
I did not have the choice,
but I am always constrained.

465
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:04,675
Please, make like your father,
say to me all that you know.

466
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:08,455
Say to me where it is.

467
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:39,625
I do not know what you have in the head,

468
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,065
but…

469
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:44,405
I go you botter the buttocks.

470
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:51,935
Be held quiet.

471
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,325
Shit!

472
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,125
Nothing presses.

473
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,905
You will play the most important part of the history.

474
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:02,555
You will devote yourself to it later.

475
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:11,925
On your back?

476
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:16,165
Very well. Here is the chart with the treasure?

477
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:37,685
It was just there.

478
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:41,755
It is well there, on the cross?

479
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:44,795
It is very simple this chart.

480
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,355
But, that imports,

481
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,465
one will check.

482
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:59,215
Thank you very much.

483
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:03,805
Now, it belongs to me.

484
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,925
There! They arrive!

485
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:22,685
At 5 a.m.!

486
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:25,115
They brought back another boat!

487
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,555
Amanda?
Is it well?

488
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,485
Wait…

489
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:30,705
What is it that this ship?

490
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:31,835
Baian,

491
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:33,875
the Baian captain is there.

492
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:34,965
Exact.

493
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:37,235
One died,
y' has anything to make.

494
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:40,985
But… it is our fault if it is in danger.

495
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:44,045
As a pirate,
I must bring back Amanda at it.

496
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:46,285
Even if that costs us our lives.

497
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,855
It is true, you are right.

498
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:04,685
It is what this music?

499
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:05,795
They is not good.

500
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:07,565
The symphony!

501
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:08,435
Luffy!

502
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:09,575
I see Luffy!

503
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:10,725
Really?

504
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:15,705
What does it manufacture?

505
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,695
A priori, not something of good.

506
00:31:18,195 --> 00:31:19,755
Everyone, flee!!

507
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:22,935
It is useless.

508
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:35,925
Leave!

509
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:40,605
What you factories, Luffy?

510
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,715
You want to kill us?

511
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:43,495
Are captain, you well?

512
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:46,205
I am sorry, but I do not have the choice.

513
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,735
It will end up breaking the boat.

514
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:49,715
It is because of Baian.

515
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:54,215
Baian can control people with this music.

516
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:57,145
You should have said it to us!

517
00:31:57,705 --> 00:32:00,445
Nami, you have my hat, thank you.

518
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:01,155
The farm!

519
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:04,665
Your friends cannot anything for you.

520
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:20,425
I already said you, I am a man-rubber band,
it is useless on me.

521
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:23,255
I give up.

522
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,435
Already?

523
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:27,415
They fight between them.

524
00:32:28,055 --> 00:32:30,385
I will regulate their account with all to them.

525
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:32,405
Bonny… it is the moment!

526
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:33,015
Yes.

527
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:46,615
Not!

528
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,485
Stop!!

529
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,145
I am afflicted, Zoro…

530
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:56,335
I want really to beat them.

531
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,465
Then do not take any to you with us!

532
00:32:58,985 --> 00:33:00,585
I do my better!

533
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:02,805
Dumb!

534
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,735
I already said you that it was not me!

535
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,365
The guy, if you touch with the mandarin trees, I kill to you!

536
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,745
Dumb!

537
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:30,495
That made a long time.

538
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:31,935
Where do you go?

539
00:33:32,255 --> 00:33:33,045
Zap!

540
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:44,315
You want to fight against me?

541
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,305
NR… not.

542
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:48,555
I want that you slacken Amanda!

543
00:33:48,555 --> 00:33:50,145
It is only one child.

544
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:52,715
Be sick for you or what?

545
00:33:53,295 --> 00:33:55,525
This young girl is a goose that lays the golden eggs.

546
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,635
You do not believe nevertheless that I will slacken it?

547
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:01,805
But, you do not need to destroy all its family.

548
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:04,775
Bonny!

549
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,805
Do not mistake.

550
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:12,775
You are not in a position to negotiate.

551
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:16,965
You really believe that it is worth the blow of it?

552
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,655
If you really hold to with it, I go exaucer your wish.

553
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:25,285
When I find the treasure,
I will send all to you by the bottom.

554
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,325
Luffy!

555
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:36,655
Dumb!
How oses you to strike Nami-San?

556
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,465
I am sorry… Nami.

557
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:41,395
Control yourself, Luffy!

558
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:42,445
Even…

559
00:34:42,475 --> 00:34:44,455
If the music does not stop…

560
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:46,755
Usopp, uses the “trick”!

561
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:49,055
Can that touch these singers?

562
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:50,965
What do you want to say?

563
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:55,835
Yes!

564
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,285
Take-that!

565
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:04,765
It is a trick which one invented, Chopper and me.

566
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:09,915
Ouais that should go.

567
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,495
Go!

568
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:38,385
What?

569
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:44,785
I can again move as I want.

570
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:46,365
You saw?

571
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:49,065
It is Chopper and me which invented them.

572
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:51,045
The balls sleeping pills!

573
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:56,145
Read the precautions for use well before taking them.

574
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:06,055
The song is stopped,
we stopped them.

575
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:08,835
You could have fled,

576
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:11,875
instead of trying to resist to me.

577
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:14,895
Let put an end to me to your lives.

578
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:18,115
Marcus!

579
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:46,025
He, young lady.

580
00:36:48,925 --> 00:36:50,885
One takes you along with us?

581
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:53,905
You two…

582
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:56,605
One will leave oneself never again only.

583
00:36:57,105 --> 00:37:00,075
If we are able to flee,
we will be able to live together.

584
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:04,055
Milia and Holly need parents.

585
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:06,945
It is a good market.

586
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:13,755
After having seen your face,
I will like to think of it a little front.

587
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,015
What does it occur?

588
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:20,335
Zap!

589
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:23,435
You are the next one!

590
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:27,945
Prepare!

591
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,045
How did you dare to destroy our ship?

592
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:51,775
Big sister!

593
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,595
Big sister, here you is!

594
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:55,425
Milia, Holly!

595
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:57,475
I am sorry for all.

596
00:37:59,325 --> 00:38:00,325
I am content.

597
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:04,105
If you had not returned,
we would not have known what to make.

598
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:05,685
Idiot.

599
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,575
How will I be able to give up you?

600
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:10,875
Good, of course you should be supported.

601
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,565
Thank you with all for your assistance.

602
00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:21,565
Thank you to have avenged our father.

603
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:25,325
Of nothing, there is boot to him the buttocks!

604
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:30,035
I thank you nevertheless.

605
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:32,595
During the month which was passed,

606
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:36,255
I had evil to include/understand the intentions
of my father in connection with the treasure,

607
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:40,625
since it always left to the adventure without thinking of our lives.

608
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:45,145
Even if I have the chart, that does not change anything,
everyone runs nevertheless after the treasure.

609
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:50,585
But… it is really stupid you
to have involved in this history.

610
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:52,475
Forgiveness.

611
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:57,045
You are wrong, big sister.

612
00:38:58,895 --> 00:39:03,845
It is to give us that our father risked his life.

613
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:08,025
We were to inherit his will and to improve our life.

614
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,685
You are right.

615
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:22,365
Well, let us re-examine all in detail.

616
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:26,495
Here is the chart of this island that one
recovered on the back of Amanda.

617
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:28,805
X shows the site of the treasure.

618
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,335
If the chart is right,

619
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,985
it must be some share in top of the mountain.

620
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:36,525
And we could need that.

621
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:39,885
It is a collar which his/her father gave to Holly.

622
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,215
And the strange mark on the chart…

623
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:48,145
If one poses the collar of Holly above,
in the direction indicated by the mark,

624
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,085
a piece is then covered.

625
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:52,975
I think that there must be something.

626
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:58,785
And when we are there, there should be the entry of a cave which leads to the treasure.

627
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:02,445
I do not manage to believe what Robin said.

628
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:06,255
But I intended some to speak, therefore that must be true.

629
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:10,045
When I think of it, the magnetic field is weak on this island.

630
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:12,885
And it is the best proof from the point of view of the magnetic field.

631
00:40:13,615 --> 00:40:15,275
It is true?

632
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:16,595
I do not manage to believe in it.

633
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:20,845
Robin was right,

634
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:22,975
I never yet saw this kind of thing!

635
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:23,695
Really?

636
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:30,295
Sanji says that they are dangerous,
and wants that we turn over on the beach!

637
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:45,965
Frankly, y' does not have a means to remove
this image of the back of Amanda?

638
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:48,945
A girl should not have this kind of mark on the back.

639
00:40:49,435 --> 00:40:50,425
Of made you not.

640
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:54,075
There exists a grass which we could use to erase it.

641
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:54,815
Pas la pains.

642
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:56,885
Eh? Does that go?

643
00:40:57,425 --> 00:41:03,235
I am well. It is my first step,
it is the beginning of my adventure.

644
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,085
Very well. They is good, Sanji.

645
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,795
One moved away, and all is ready.

646
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,075
Heard.

647
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:15,005
Zoro, they is good.

648
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:15,685
Included/understood.

649
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,635
It is necessary just that I cut that.

650
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,345
Move back Luffy, or you will be wounded.

651
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:24,535
Of agreement.

652
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:36,395
That arrives!

653
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,825
Zoro… Here too.

654
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:41,615
Do not give me an order.

655
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:44,215
Stop marmonner, and do it!

656
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:46,195
Go!

657
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:48,995
It is not a couteau de cuisine.

658
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,245
That opens!

659
00:42:10,585 --> 00:42:16,345
If they is too large, that could touch benches of corals and one would remain wedged here.

660
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:20,425
And there will be much grass
because of the accumulation of mud.

661
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:23,135
One hardly manages to see whether it is an island or not.

662
00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:32,555
One calls that a “hole of boat”.

663
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:39,915
And here.

664
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:44,295
It is an oyster.

665
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:46,925
It is enormous!

666
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:49,055
Why is it so large?

667
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,145
Super… Sanji.

668
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:54,945
That with the delicious air.

669
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:56,145
You want to eat it?

670
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,035
Y' has some enough for 10000 people at least.

671
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,785
But that foutrait me the tokens if it really managed to eat it.

672
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:05,625
Now…
Here is the treasure of the father of Amanda?

673
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:07,875
It is that.

674
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:12,975
Amanda, I want to leave to the adventure.

675
00:43:13,775 --> 00:43:17,075
I want to find the treasure which will accompany my affection for you.

676
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,625
And then, one will be happy as if your mother were still there.

677
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,925
I want to find the super gross fortune.

678
00:43:28,655 --> 00:43:29,945
Super!

679
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:31,495
It is a pearl!

680
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:33,495
It is enormous!

681
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:39,575
Well, this should bring happiness to you.

682
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:44,895
It is all that I can do for you.

683
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:46,195
Forgive me.

684
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:55,355
There is one treasure.

685
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:57,215
Yes… only one.

686
00:43:57,725 --> 00:43:58,715
Only one.

687
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:03,555
Dad.

688
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:06,345
Thank you, dad.

689
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:10,125
I included/understood your intentions, dad.

690
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:12,995
I thank you.

691
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:18,515
Amanda!

692
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:21,225
Your father is fantastic!

693
00:44:21,655 --> 00:44:23,985
He found a large treasure!

694
00:44:27,145 --> 00:44:29,645
It is quite true!!

695
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:33,465
They is best fathers!!

696
00:44:45,145 --> 00:44:46,955
Eyes fixing reality

697
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:53,105
can nothing see, with share the dreams.

698
00:44:53,105 --> 00:44:57,735
Extraordinary poursuiveurs of dreams

699
00:44:57,915 --> 00:45:01,665
do not see the power.

700
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:09,615
The affection is not necessary…
Go from before with the smile.

701
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:18,585
The significance of the family it is “they are your onions”.

702
00:45:18,855 --> 00:45:28,095
Whether you are hungry or that you cry,
I will always give you a knack.

703
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:39,615
The best friend is always the best.

704
00:45:40,995 --> 00:45:44,815
Not only knowledge, not only friends.

705
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:48,385
We are a family.

706
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:53,365
Not only our close relations or our brothers.

707
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:57,405
We are a family.

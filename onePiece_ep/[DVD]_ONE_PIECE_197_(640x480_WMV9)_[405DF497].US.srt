1
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,083
SANJI THE COOK!
ART CULINAIRE MARINERE!

2
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:09,082
It is true that these pirates
fell from the sky?

3
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,416
Incredible.

4
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:14,416
But Navarone is
the surest fortress.

5
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:18,083
Besides this boat which
has just fallen from the sky,

6
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,682
it would seem that he there
nobody on his board has…

7
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:21,550
It is as if it were
arrived all alone!

8
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:27,615
How…

9
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:29,949
coffee was drunk here
little time ago.

10
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,150
L was to have somebody on board there…

11
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,216
And there was also…

12
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,616
MUCH GOLD!

13
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:44,283
I heard of a gold relic.

14
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:48,083
L says things
appalling about it.

15
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,216
Is this one… ghost ship?

16
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:53,400
This boat east can be cursed
by this old relic

17
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,283
He will certainly wander until
to disappear with this world.

18
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,550
“Order of the commander Drake,”

19
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,416
“The council must meet in the station of
as fast as possible order No 1 of the tower! “

20
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,615
I do not know if it is
the ghost ship or not.

21
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:07,615
But seeks he to defy
the Navarone fortress?

22
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:08,550
One goes there!

23
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,100
“Contact 4th, 6th and 9th units!”

24
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,416
These units, which are?
“Contact 4th, 6th and 9th units!”

25
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,016
“You in the station Join together
of ordering of the tower! “

26
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,082
Navarone?

27
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,483
I see, it is thus that.

28
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,415
Then like that, we fell pile…

29
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,816
in one of the fortresses of
Navy protected.

30
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,350
You intend to react, Mister the captain?

31
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,483
L of fout completely…

32
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,683
L is necessary to hurry,
it is a state of emergency!

33
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,615
The boat was moored with the quay No 88,

34
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:48,750
and excavated basic in roof.

35
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:53,483
General.

36
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,082
Stanberry with the report/ratio.

37
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,682
Although I said to them…

38
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:57,749
Forgiveness?

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,350
that we are in state of emergency…

40
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:04,416
Our losses were enormous
because of C storm.

41
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,216
It is a cas de force majeure.

42
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:08,916
Do not lose a second. Make us
to enter, we need care.

43
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,883
L is true that you were
detached from the base. But…

44
00:04:12,216 --> 00:04:15,816
there are great chances that there is one
crew of pirates infiltrated in the base.

45
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,950
We cannot accept.

46
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,000
So of other boats enter,

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,650
there will be an useless chaos…

48
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,350
Open to them…
there will be an useless chaos…

49
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:26,015
I accept their request.

50
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,883
Find to them a medical team.

51
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:30,483
Yes!

52
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:34,950
Commander!

53
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,749
On Large Line, people taken
in a storm are in danger.

54
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,150
On Large Line, people taken
in a storm are in danger.

55
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,550
You would owe the knowledge.

56
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,215
It is true but…

57
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,150
If…

58
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:52,815
we remain inactive too a long time,

59
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:56,750
Which will be the fastest means
to leave the fortress…?

60
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,015
But why come here, in Navarone?

61
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,550
Monkey D. Luffy.

62
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,949
The boat is in sight.

63
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,749
Pass in level 1 of alarm.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,550
The bridge is ready.

65
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:24,283
Which large fortress…

66
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,349
It is the first time queje come here.

67
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,616
Gigantic!

68
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:33,283
What it is
large this fortress!

69
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,616
It is difficult to be found here…

70
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,950
We must leave from there.

71
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:45,816
The more time passes, the more it will be difficult.

72
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,216
Where are the different ones?

73
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:54,483
Oh not.

74
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,616
What is it?

75
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,350
It is really gigantic.

76
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,816
Where is Merry?

77
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,883
Merry disappeared!

78
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,015
Wait!

79
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,750
Where is Merry?

80
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,549
Where is my gold?

81
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,816
However… However… However…

82
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:16,283
It was so hard to obtain such an amount of gold…

83
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:18,616
A boat.

84
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,816
It is a warship.

85
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,949
The 31eme unit.

86
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,883
Go to the building B of the 7th zone.

87
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,749
The boat can enter this fortress.

88
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,750
That wants to say that it is not a lake.

89
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,482
L must have a passage there towards outside.

90
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:35,883
Perfect.

91
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,483
Let us join together the others and
let us find Merry together.

92
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,349
We must benefit from this chaos.

93
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,482
We can flee disguise as sailors.

94
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,616
And perhaps to obtain information.

95
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,016
Where?

96
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,682
They know the faces of Zoro and Luffy…

97
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,882
But not mine.

98
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,216
It is here?

99
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,083
Zut!

100
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,483
It is what this whore of fortress?

101
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:05,283
A labyrinth would be said.

102
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:09,016
Do you know where is the kitchen?

103
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,283
Kitchen?

104
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,483
Yes, yes, I know where it is…

105
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:17,216
We are boat which
has just arrived.

106
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,615
Can you help us?
We lost our way.

107
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:21,683
You are lost…

108
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,415
Me also I often lost
my way five years ago.

109
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,682
That made five years that you are here?

110
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,950
Bring us to the kitchen, please.

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,650
As a chief-cook one cannot
not to waste more time.

112
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,083
I in taken to you…

113
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,349
Do I have the choice?

114
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,649
We are of Maryjor.

115
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,949
Ca does not cost you anything to help us.

116
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,900
Ca does not bring back anything to me…

117
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,015
Ok, casserole.

118
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,283
That pleases to me.

119
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,750
Do you know something about this fortress?

120
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,549
Not, we are only of the chief-cook.

121
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,483
We are recognized by the navy.

122
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:58,483
Oh, you are famous…

123
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:03,150
It is the Master of the restaurant which sends to us.

124
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,483
We cooked put delicious
for the soldiers in front Maryjor.

125
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:08,949
We are better than…

126
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:16,150
finally let us let be to them the only judges about it.

127
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
I have anything of it to beat…

128
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,650
Initially I must absolutely find the others…

129
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,750
will espéront that they have of advantage of information.

130
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,015
Waouh! You seem to be gifted chief-cooks.

131
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,649
Then, turn right to the first intersection.

132
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,749
Then on the left with the intersection
following, You will find the kitchen.

133
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,149
This way?

134
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,283
Yes.

135
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:35,615
Goodbye.

136
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,816
Is this the first intersection?

137
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:38,749
Hein?

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,816
Hein?

139
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,283
Hein…?

140
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:46,949
It is well that.

141
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,416
Roronoa Zoro

142
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,215
L would seem that the boat pirates is
that of Luffy to the Straw hat…

143
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:55,349
Jonasan, the commander orders to us…

144
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,882
However I am convinced that our unit has
all capacities necessary to capture them.

145
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:58,682
And…

146
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,749
The most important enemy must be…

147
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,150
Roronoa Zoro.

148
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,749
L was formerly called “hunter of pirates”.

149
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,149
L is famous for one
technique called “Santo Ryu”

150
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,482
Let us capture it, a point it is all.

151
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,550
And let us make regret having put a foot to him here.

152
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,150
What do they tell, them?

153
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,349
Hein?

154
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,349
What I can well
to make here now?

155
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,949
How you can remain
quiet with so much of arrogance?

156
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,815
Ouch be to you that a snotty-nosed kid.

157
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,149
Oh? It is you.

158
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,082
You ballades with your swords.

159
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:31,283
You are easy to locate.

160
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:32,683
Hein?

161
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,150
In any event, we hide initially.

162
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:37,750
Brothel, my katanas!

163
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:42,149
It is time to eat.

164
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,883
I am hungry.

165
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,483
They left?

166
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,882
Stop worrying you…

167
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:50,815
If there is not an other choice, we will batrons ourselves.

168
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:51,749
Daaa!

169
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,482
One cannot do that.

170
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:56,350
Did we envisage to join the others?

171
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:57,415
Of course.

172
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,349
But I do not know yet where is Merry.

173
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,949
Would not be so anxious.

174
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,216
Benefit from the landscape.

175
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:07,616
We cannot appreciate it of night.

176
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:09,015
It is beautiful here.

177
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,283
He Nami, finds the others, which they see that.

178
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:12,749
Not thank you!

179
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,883
In any event, it is that where to remain here.

180
00:10:14,883 --> 00:10:17,882
All that one would gain there they are troubles.

181
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,415
He brothel! My katanas!

182
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,815
You do what with my swords?

183
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:21,616
Whore…

184
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,815
Acknowledge that one is lost.

185
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:29,216
I leave to seek the others then I
return to seek itself.

186
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:29,816
But before…

187
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:30,616
He, snotty-nosed kid…
But before…

188
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,682
What do you make?

189
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:33,750
One was made have.

190
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,416
lmpossible.

191
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,415
How can you remain nothing there to make?

192
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,950
With the job and that jumps.

193
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:42,950
With your orders.

194
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:48,683
The crew of the ghost ship
is decided with remain to hide.

195
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,283
In any event aborrd should be eaten.

196
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,615
A ghost ship?

197
00:10:54,616 --> 00:10:56,349
Did you hear spoken about puffs out?

198
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,283
Restaurant?

199
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,882
TO EAT, WHAT!!

200
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,150
Wait!

201
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:02,949
What, what takes to you?

202
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,015
Quiet remainder.

203
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,150
Am not afraid, will seek to eat.

204
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,682
To eat…

205
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,882
To eat…

206
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,549
Be to you shitting.

207
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,550
Do not move.

208
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,083
More one gesture.

209
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:17,616
Strange.

210
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:18,882
It is a hallucination?

211
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:21,350
Perhaps let us be us too gone far…

212
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,416
One is tired too much.

213
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,483
In any event, it is initially necessary to eat.

214
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:28,816
Moron!

215
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:31,350
One failed to be made have.

216
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,082
That at the right moment.

217
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,949
One will pass unperceived like that, not?

218
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,950
That feels good.

219
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,483
It is the kitchen here?

220
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,483
Funny of sight.

221
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,549
There are recruits which arrived.

222
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,216
What? Already? This type which speaks extremely?

223
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:59,417
It had not been said to you that this type was to arrive?

224
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:01,216
They are foreigners.

225
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:02,482
Let us not be malicious.

226
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:03,417
Yes!

227
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:08,883
Meat, it is… the odor of the meat!!

228
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,283
You cannot calm yourself?

229
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:13,882
All of which I want it is of…

230
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:15,216
to eat meat…

231
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:17,216
In eating much…

232
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,617
It is all?

233
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:19,282
Luffy!

234
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,417
MEAT!

235
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,317
“ART CULINAIRE MARINERE!”

236
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,083
It is you?

237
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,683
Alleged brothers of Mary.

238
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,017
Marry…

239
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:42,817
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

240
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:50,017
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

241
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,017
Hello!

242
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,950
You are the chief-cooks
who came from Maryjor?

243
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:00,816
Hein?

244
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:05,483
How you can say that our
fortress is a campaign.

245
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,416
And to say that we are cooks of low level.

246
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,882
Show us what you can do.

247
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:13,149
What? You are mistaken on us.

248
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,950
Nothing to make, I want to eat! Give me
meat to be eaten!

249
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,883
It is you…

250
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:24,082
The imbeciles who cook for graded of Maryjor…

251
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,350
and which waste a million Berrys per week?

252
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,283
It does not matter which you are.

253
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:35,282
Here the holiest place in Navarone.

254
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:36,750
It is the kitchen.

255
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:43,549
If we decide it, you will not be able
to put one foot more here.

256
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,283
It is true.

257
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,016
Quite known as Jessica-san.

258
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:51,283
L has there thousand courageous soldiers in this fortress.

259
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,949
Our cooks make of their better for the soldiers…

260
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,950
To make them strong…

261
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,882
That they can fight for their fatherland.

262
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:06,083
Each day they make of their better.

263
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:09,817
They are better than the chief-cooks…

264
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,883
who can only praise themselves.

265
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,350
Astonishing what you ridges.

266
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,949
Do not forget it.

267
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,617
The meal is made…

268
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:25,617
with the heart.

269
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,683
Do you want to learn how to me to cook?

270
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,882
I am not so pretentious.

271
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:43,883
I want just to say that it is our pride.

272
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,682
Who who you are…

273
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,950
and what imports your talent,

274
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:53,683
you are likely to annoy you here.

275
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,483
That it is clear,

276
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,882
if I decide not to admit you…

277
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:01,282
you could never be a chief-cook with Navarone.

278
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:02,817
I see…

279
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:05,550
You are caught well too much with the serious one,
Miss.

280
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,217
What, it is what this to foutoir?

281
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:11,482
L would seem that the chiefs want
to make a duel of kitchen.

282
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:12,816
Let see me.

283
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,017
Are these types the chiefs who arrive of the base?

284
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,882
Use what you want.

285
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:20,882
The rule is simple,

286
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,549
Prepare a meal percent soldiers.

287
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,550
The soldiers will decide who is the winner.

288
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,682
I include/understand anything, but they is enthralling.

289
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:32,550
One starts when you want.

290
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,617
We will give best ourselves
to the last breath.

291
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,883
Let us do our better.

292
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:45,950
Hein?

293
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,950
If you do not finish, you lose.

294
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:57,749
That is there.

295
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,616
Percent soldiers.

296
00:15:58,617 --> 00:15:59,750
And you?

297
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:02,616
Cool, really fast.

298
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:03,217
That with the good air.

299
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:04,450
Do not touch.
That with the good air.

300
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:08,283
Of course, usually we cook
for thousand people.

301
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,949
Incredible, you do not find?

302
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,150
It is the secrecy of the chief-cooks of Navarone.

303
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:15,750
Hein?

304
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,082
Which wasting…

305
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:20,300
What does he want to make?

306
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,283
C this standard…

307
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,483
Impossible!

308
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,550
Perhaps that he wants to use remainders…

309
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,950
The head and edges,

310
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,217
as well as the intestines must be crushed…

311
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,950
then mixed with vegetables.

312
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,283
After make fry them in oil…

313
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,217
until it bubbles.

314
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,017
Sprinkle with the fish juice.

315
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,750
The bitterness can stimulate the appetite.

316
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,150
The spiced taste can stimulate the tired body.

317
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,817
In this case, fresh vegetables are necessary.

318
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:04,282
The potato is good.

319
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:10,817
For a soldier, it is the best food.

320
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:15,550
The broccoli cream is sonctueuse.

321
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,017
Hop!

322
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:23,550
Look at this full food
of love and vitamins.

323
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,017
In period of war,

324
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,149
it is not necessary that is tasty.

325
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,683
But rather to save each ingredient.

326
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:42,816
It does not matter… Ten thousand or one million Berrys…

327
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:45,817
We should not waste an ingredient.

328
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,817
It does not matter food, you
must make it cook with love.

329
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:53,283
It is like the love of a woman.

330
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,550
You all must like it.

331
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,683
I have never to eat food if
tasty. But of what I lime pits…

332
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,682
Incredible!

333
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,082
Shit, one does not have the right to lose.

334
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,349
But I do too much of it.

335
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,816
I can just use the best ingredients.

336
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:16,482
That changes luxurious food
eaten by the rich person.

337
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:18,883
It is the food of the courageous soldiers.

338
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:22,082
It is the faith of Jessica-san.

339
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,416
But I forgot it.

340
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,882
And right fact of the wasting.

341
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:27,116
87…

342
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:28,617
88…

343
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:29,883
89…

344
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:30,900
90…

345
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,817
91…

346
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:33,217
92…

347
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:34,882
93…

348
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,283
94… 95… 96… 97… 98… Hmmm…

349
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,583
Iccroyable!
94… 95… 96… 97… 98… Hmmm…

350
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,583
Nobody Na ever eaten as much!
94… 95… 96… 97… 98… Hmmm…

351
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:44,017
99…

352
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,550
100!

353
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,950
Oh!

354
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,817
What doesn't go?

355
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,017
You are well?

356
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,550
Say something.

357
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,950
It is too boooooooon!

358
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,082
I am more hungry.

359
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,683
I am happy.

360
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,683
Allons-y.

361
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,950
They was really good.

362
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,017
Thank you, Miss.

363
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:19,282
If possible, I will not fight
with you. A so pretty girl…

364
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,682
You include/understand.

365
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:21,950
Miss.

366
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,750
Wait.

367
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,750
does L remain food?

368
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,950
You want that I remain dishonoured forever?

369
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,149
I like you.

370
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,350
Your kindness and your eloquence.

371
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:40,883
You are ours now.

372
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,683
Really? Jessica-san!

373
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:55,950
They are not easy to find.

374
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:58,883
Obviously, Commander.

375
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,082
They are pirates.

376
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,617
They will not come in a so dangerous place.

377
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:06,016
We control all here.

378
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:10,217
I reflected much there… It must
there to have somebody of hidden.

379
00:20:10,483 --> 00:20:16,216
Probably one or two stupid pirates.

380
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,883
Really?

381
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,083
Perhaps that we will not miss them today.

382
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:25,883
Hein?

383
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,017
Shit, navigatrice with nut.

384
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,550
What took to him to balance them,
 bloody hell…?

385
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:29,149
Whore…

386
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,283
Whore, stone with the idiot.

387
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,083
Welcome with Navarone.

388
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,350
Hein?

389
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,417
And of one…

390
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:50,549
What doesn't go?

391
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,150
Who knows.

392
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,083
Dirtiness of head of lawn!

393
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:13,884
What is this you ace say, brothel?

394
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:15,949
You ace of the chance that one is still alive!

395
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,283
Good…

396
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:18,416
You will remain a small moment here.

397
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,816
Where it is the different one?

398
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:23,016
These types should reflect one
little themselves with if ation.

399
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:23,949
Chopper!

400
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,683
What you insane still with the infirmary?

401
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:28,016
Soon in One Part

402
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:31,016
The urgent operation of Zoro and Chopper!

403
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:33,284
I will become… the lord of the pirates.

404
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:35,884
The URGENT OPERATION
ZORO AND CHOPPER!

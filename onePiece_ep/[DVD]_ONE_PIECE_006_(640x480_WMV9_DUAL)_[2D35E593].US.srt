1
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:53,973
Quick! Light the fuse!

2
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:59,656
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

3
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:22,033
Zoro!

4
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,016
Attack behind me! You are so nasty!

5
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,008
Big nose!

6
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:48,300
Hey, Zoro. You are hurt.

7
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,633
You go inside and stay there.

8
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,572
I am doing it my way.

9
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,342
What's wrong with this man?

10
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:06,281
Luffy, who is she?

11
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,653
She is our navigator.

12
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,855
Are you kidding? Who the hell are you?

13
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,931
Get away.

14
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,224
Don't bother me.

15
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:31,180
(Episode 6) "Desperate Situation!
Beast Tamer Mohji vs. Luffy!"

16
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:36,278
(Episode 6) "Zettaizetsumei!
Moujuu-tsukai Mohji VS Luffy!"

17
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:41,924
<i>(Based on manga ch.12: "Dog", ch.13:
"Treasure" and ch.14: "Reckless")</i>

18
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:52,492
Why are you risking your
life? You are not a pirate yet.

19
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,770
Those people didn't
respect me. What a joke.

20
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,243
They must be here to challenge me.

21
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,539
Here you are, Mohji.

22
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:14,380
I want Zoro's head. I am leaving.

23
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:17,484
Well, OK.

24
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,750
Where did this dog come from?

25
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:54,329
Oh... the dog.

26
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,807
Hey, Zoro. Why isn't he moving at all?

27
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,678
How should I know? It's
his freedom to stay still.

28
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,252
Is it dead?

29
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:34,098
Stop playing around!

30
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,497
Damn dog.

31
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:41,303
I bled too much.

32
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:48,073
Hi, navigator.

33
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:51,902
Please take this.
Thank you for saving me.

34
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,455
Oh. The key!

35
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:58,425
You stole this for
me? Thank you so much!

36
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,324
Don't take this the wrong way.

37
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:03,864
I just don't want to owe you.

38
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,960
Thank god.

39
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:19,174
Cough it up!

40
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:22,716
Stupid dog! It's not
your food! Spit it out!

41
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:25,013
Stupid dog, spit it out!

42
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,617
Spit it out, come on!

43
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,487
Hey!

44
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:34,624
Kids, don't take
advantage of Chou-Chou!

45
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:36,566
Chou-Chou?

46
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,100
Who are you, man?

47
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,726
I am the mayor.

48
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,601
Who are you guys?

49
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:49,610
Hey, you are hurt so bad.

50
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:52,146
You must be hurt by Buggy.

51
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:55,115
You have to see the doctor right away.

52
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:03,282
Where's Zoro?

53
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,621
I told him to see the doctor.

54
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,910
He said he just needed
sleep. What is he thinking?

55
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:23,441
Is this dog called Chou-Chou?

56
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,811
Why is he sitting here?

57
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,611
He is guarding the shop.

58
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:29,683
Guarding?

59
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,081
Yes.

60
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:35,317
Oh, it's a pet shop.

61
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,358
It is.

62
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:41,657
The owner was my good friend.

63
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:54,134
I am here to feed Chou-Chou for him.

64
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:55,811
For him?

65
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:58,436
Yes, he is dead.

66
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:02,244
He died of an illness.

67
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:07,015
Your saying he has been waiting
for his master to come back?

68
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,950
Everyone said so.

69
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:19,699
But I don't think so.

70
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:22,796
Chou-Chou is a smart dog.

71
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:26,932
He should know his owner is dead.

72
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:34,047
Then why is he still here?

73
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:38,381
It's because the shop is the
most precious thing to him.

74
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:41,285
It's the only thing left
from his most beloved owner.

75
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:44,393
So he will stay with it forever.

76
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:47,189
I tried to take him
to avoid the disaster.

77
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,198
But he didn't even move one step.

78
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:16,892
What? What's that sound?

79
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,359
It must be him! Mohji the Lion Tamer!

80
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,993
What tamer?

81
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,032
Hey, hold on.

82
00:09:27,136 --> 00:09:31,436
Oh, here comes trouble.

83
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,199
Give me the key, please.

84
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:42,911
Oh, your pal left you? Poor
thing. It's hard to get out.

85
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:44,644
Who are you?

86
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,421
I am Mohji the Lion
Tamer, Buggy's First Mate.

87
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,182
Why are you wearing strange fur?

88
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:58,995
That's rude! Its my hair!

89
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,397
Then it's even more strange.

90
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:04,529
You think you are safe in the cage?

91
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:06,665
You don't seem to fear me.

92
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:12,475
There is no animal that
I can't tame in the world.

93
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:13,355
Shake hands.

94
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:21,419
You are just a little nobody.

95
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:23,286
I am not interested in your life.

96
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,451
Tell me where Zoro is.

97
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,085
No.

98
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,562
Go, Richie!

99
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,636
Great! It's open!

100
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,970
He is dead.

101
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:45,137
Ok, Richie. Go look for Zoro.

102
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:48,045
Kill him and I will be famous.

103
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:51,852
What is that? It's a pet shop.

104
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:54,650
Ok, finish your food and go to work.

105
00:10:56,192 --> 00:11:01,357
What? The little dog
is guarding this crummy shop?

106
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,265
That's incredible!

107
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,931
But it's good to get out of the cage.

108
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:18,108
OK! Let's kick butt!

109
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:20,410
And make Nami my navigator!

110
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:23,747
Why are you still alive?

111
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:25,046
You are still alive.

112
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:26,587
Can't I be alive?

113
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:29,282
The house has been destroyed.

114
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,949
And you survived? Too weird.

115
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,492
Really?

116
00:11:32,628 --> 00:11:36,120
What are you doing in this town?

117
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,028
Why did you mess with the pirate?

118
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,896
I just figured out why I am here.

119
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:43,282
I want to find the treasure
map and the right navigator.

120
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:49,542
That weird guy wants to find
Zoro. Let me check it out!

121
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,953
Chou-Chou, it's
our shop, just you and me.

122
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:14,132
<i>That bag is too big for Chou-Chou.</i>

123
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:33,540
<i>Chou-Chou, you can't
be hurt. Let me do it.</i>

124
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,157
<i>Chou-Chou, did I tell you not
to eat the things in the shop?</i>

125
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:42,662
<i>Come, eat this.</i>

126
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:55,540
Oh, you just don't
know how to be afraid.

127
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,213
<i>Chou-Chou, I am sick.</i>

128
00:13:00,349 --> 00:13:02,579
<i>I have to stay in hospital.</i>

129
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:05,812
<i>Don't worry, I will get well.</i>

130
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:09,322
<i>Before I come back,
you stay in the shop.</i>

131
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,892
<i>It's all in your hands.</i>

132
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,499
<i>It's itchy, Chou-Chou.</i>

133
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:05,739
It's because this shop is
Chou-Chou's most precious thing.

134
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:08,441
<i>This is left from his beloved owner.</i>

135
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:12,315
<i>So he wants to stay
with the shop forever.</i>

136
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:39,670
Damn, this dog bit me.

137
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:50,289
Aren't you dead?

138
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:54,762
I am not that easy to get killed.

139
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,923
Then I will eat up your brain!

140
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:04,204
This damn lion doesn't know who I am.

141
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,466
Gomu Gomu No...

142
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:11,642
Gavel!

143
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,052
Richie!

144
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:23,122
What kind of monster are you?

145
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,395
I ate the "Rubber Fruit."

146
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:34,629
You ate the Devil Fruit,
like Captain Buggy?

147
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm sorry.

148
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:45,237
You don't have to be.

149
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:48,316
No matter what you done, it
won't bring back his owner.

150
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:54,945
So I will clobber you instead!

151
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:20,709
Damn all the pirates in the world.

152
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,581
They took the people's love.

153
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
Hey, this pirate is still alive.

154
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:31,852
I thought you were eaten by the lion.

155
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:35,157
Since you are a pirate, I will kill you!

156
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:38,528
Before you kill others.

157
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,532
I will kill you first!

158
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,830
Don't, girl.

159
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,872
You think you can beat me?

160
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:46,201
Show me what you got!

161
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:49,800
Stop that! What's
the matter with you?

162
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,752
I only got you this box back.

163
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:07,829
He ate the rest.

164
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:12,127
He fought the lion...

165
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:14,634
<i>for the dog.</i>

166
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:20,570
You are really brave.
Even I didn't see it.

167
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,677
But I can imagine.

168
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:45,098
You cheer up, too.

169
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:02,245
You've been beaten?

170
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:06,252
I am sorry, Captain Buggy.

171
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:09,915
Mohji, you've been beaten by Zoro.

172
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,789
No, not Zoro. It's the guy with hat.

173
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:16,420
What? You were beaten by that kid?

174
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:18,624
Because he is...

175
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,826
I am really angry!

176
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,602
Go set the Buggy Ball. I
will bomb this town flat!

177
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:29,973
I am sorry.

178
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:33,108
I yelled at you.

179
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:36,810
Forget about it. You have your reason.

180
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:41,852
I don't want to ask too much.

181
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:43,347
I am useless.

182
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:46,461
Even Chou-Chou fought for his family.

183
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:51,862
As mayor, how can I see this town
being destroyed without doing anything?

184
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,832
Mayor, please calm down.

185
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:57,666
40 years ago, It's a deserted land here.

186
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:00,297
<i>We claimed this land.</i>

187
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,842
<i>We built the farm land and the shops.</i>

188
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,912
<i>We built this town little by little.</i>

189
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:09,108
<i>This town is our treasure.</i>

190
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:13,278
I won't let the pirate ruin our land!

191
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:16,974
Fire the Buggy
Ball. Blow the whole town!

192
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:31,038
Even my home is destroyed.

193
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:34,199
Hey, Zoro is sleeping inside!

194
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,506
Is that man dead?

195
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:40,447
Hey, Zoro! Are you alive?

196
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:43,415
Why are you so loud?

197
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:49,754
I need to sleep more.

198
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,556
It's amazing you are alive.

199
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:54,788
Great, you are not dead!

200
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,491
I won't allow this to hapen again.

201
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,124
I can't stand this anymore.

202
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:06,003
Those bastards from nowhere have no
right to ruin our 40 years of effort.

203
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:11,340
I am the mayor of this town.

204
00:20:12,348 --> 00:20:16,114
I am protecting this town!

205
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:19,345
Wait, mayor.

206
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:23,117
We are men. We have to face the war!

207
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:24,054
Right, kid?

208
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:25,888
Yes, sir!

209
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,393
Don't you make it worse!

210
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:30,726
What can you do about it?
You will only get killed!

211
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:33,391
I know I might get killed.

212
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:39,868
Let's wait
and see, Buggy clown!

213
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,341
Mayor cried.

214
00:20:42,478 --> 00:20:44,742
He did? I didn't see it.

215
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,007
It's showtime now.

216
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,141
Yeah, right.

217
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,753
You are still laughing.

218
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:55,982
Don't worry, I love that man.

219
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,854
I will never let him die.

220
00:20:57,993 --> 00:21:00,154
If you say so.

221
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,957
Are you going, too?
You are seriously hurt!

222
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:08,434
It's just a little wound. My
reputation is much more important.

223
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,437
Our goal is the Grand Line.

224
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:15,270
We are going to get the map back.

225
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:19,514
Be my partner, Nami.

226
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:22,064
I don't want to be a pirate.

227
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:28,631
But we can do it together
for our own purpose.

228
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,655
It's ready to fire again.

229
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:35,457
Ok, fire.

230
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:39,294
Buggy the
Clown! Get out here now!

231
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:44,265
I am the mayor, Boodle.

232
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,136
I am here for my home town!

233
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:48,743
Let's get it over with right now!

234
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,344
You idiot.

235
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:53,073
You called your town "treasure"?

236
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:56,309
What a joke. Don't be stupid.

237
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:59,546
People like you will never
understand how others feel!

238
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:06,792
I am the man who will get
the treasure and rule the ocean.

239
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,954
All the treasure in the world is mine.

240
00:22:09,098 --> 00:22:11,828
Nobody but me can, and
dare to, own the treasure.

241
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:16,961
If you love this town so much,
then be prepared to die with it!

242
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:20,542
I will fight to the death.

243
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,143
You are like a mouse to me.

244
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:26,347
I will never let you ruin
the town, even if I die.

245
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:29,980
Let go of me.

246
00:22:32,154 --> 00:22:34,384
It's the hat kid again.

247
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:49,902
I am here to beat you up to the sky.

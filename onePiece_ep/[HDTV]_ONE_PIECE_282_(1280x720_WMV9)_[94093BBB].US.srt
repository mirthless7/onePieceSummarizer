1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,250
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,150
The man who had acquired everything in this 
world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,890
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,570
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,500
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,220
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,010
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,330
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,760
Looks like those guys did it.

10
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,800
What great timing.

11
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,640
Trying to die alone is too painful, Robin-chan.

12
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't wanna see any more victims.

13
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,620
I don't remember asking you to be nice to me!

14
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,370
Why?

15
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,660
WHY!?

16
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,140
What happened to your leg?

17
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,900
Without that leg, you can't be a pirate anymore, can you!?

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,230
I guess not.

19
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,780
Why?

20
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,670
You didn't have to!

21
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,870
I don't remember asking you to be nice to me!

22
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,620
Why?

23
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,830
WHY!?

24
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,830
Because you...

25
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,000
You have the same dream as I do.

26
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,100
All Blue?

27
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,510
But, even your nakama said it doesn't exist.

28
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,050
Of course it exists!

29
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,450
When the time comes, you head for the Grand Line!

30
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,480
All Blue will definitely be there!

31
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,980
As you can see, I can no longer be a pirate.

32
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,650
But, this time, you can go out and find it!

33
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,710
Oi! Old man, don't die!

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,660
After what you did...

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
Don't die after what you did!

36
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,330
That shitty old man...

37
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,130
He sacrificed his leg so that I could live.

38
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,050
I also...

39
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,710
If I'm even gonna be able to repay him for that...

40
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,300
I have to be willing to place my life on the line!

41
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,310
Dying wouldn't pay him back!

42
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,730
That's not why he saved you.

43
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,860
To die after someone let you live...

44
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,240
That's only what weaklings do!

45
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,490
Then what else can I do to set things right!?

46
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,000
Errand boy!

47
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,640
Errand boy...

48
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,310
Are you okay!?

49
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,450
That's nothing...

50
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,200
<i>You made me  angry!</i>

51
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,490
I'm not gonna let you die so easily.

52
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,260
Shit...

53
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,670
That Krieg jerk keeps bringing out more weapons!

54
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,000
There's no way he could match up to that.

55
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,380
Even if armed with hundreds of weapons...

56
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,590
...there are times when you just can't beat a man with a spear of conviction in his gut.

57
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,150
To live or to die.

58
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,280
In a battle between pirates, those who fear death completely crumble.

59
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,990
What are you talking about?

60
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,580
At least...

61
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,670
...for that kid...

62
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,970
...there's no hesitation.

63
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,430
It's either his way of preparing to live,

64
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,810
or his conviction to refuse death.

65
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,360
Conviction?

66
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,870
If Krieg's squadron is his force of power,

67
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,790
along with his poison and hundreds of weapons.

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,830
Then that kid's spear...

69
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,460
That's his force of power.

70
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,220
The spear that he's got in his gut...

71
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,090
For some stupid reason,

72
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,140
I know an idiot that's suppressing the spear in his gut.

73
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,360
This time...

74
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,780
IT'S REALLY OVER!!

75
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,790
GOMU GOMU NO

76
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,760
Oozuchi

77
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,110
Wait!

78
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,780
I guess we both have stupid dreams.

79
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm going for my objective, to find All Blue.

80
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,600
Sanji?

81
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,210
Yeah, I'll join you on your so-called road to becoming the Pirate King.

82
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,590
I'll accept the position of cook on your ship.

83
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,680
Is that okay or not?

84
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,640
OF COURSE!!

85
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah!

86
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,730
That's great, Luffy-aniki!

87
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,900
Yeah! Yeah! A cook! It's food!

88
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,980
Yeah! Yeah!

89
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,830
So that's how it'll be, everyone.

90
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,320
Sorry for being such a burden.

91
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,480
I don't like it...

92
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,120
You piss me off!

93
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,370
I wanted to kick you out of here myself,

94
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,700
and now you're leaving with such ease.

95
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,190
Sorry about that...

96
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,710
Sorry for making you put on such a bad performance, too.

97
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,750
What!? You knew!?

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,750
It was obvious!

99
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,380
You guys are so stupid.

100
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,140
What!?

101
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,600
So you went through all that trouble to kick me outta here, right?

102
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,550
Shitty old man!

103
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,520
Why do you have to have such a foul mouth?!

104
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,110
That's right, li'l eggplant.

105
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
I never liked kids anyway!

106
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,490
There's never a day I don't regret letting an idiot like you live, you little brat.

107
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,540
That's excellent, shitty old man.

108
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,200
Enjoy the rest of your life in peace.

109
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,770
Oh! That's a nice boat!

110
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,970
Can we really use it?

111
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,910
It's Sanji's, of course we can.

112
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,090
Let's go.

113
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,510
Don't you have to say goodbye?

114
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,010
It's fine.

115
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,390
Sanji!

116
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,520
Don't catch a cold...

117
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,950
OWNER ZEFF!!

118
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,440
For all these years...

119
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,040
Thank you so damn much!

120
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,750
<i>I'll never  forget!</i>

121
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,670
I'm forever in your debt!

122
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,280
DAMN IT!!

123
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,450
We'll miss you! Damn it!

124
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,450
We'll miss you!

125
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,050
We'll miss you!

126
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,140
It's so sad! Damn it!

127
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,980
You morons!

128
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,480
Men are supposed to bid farewell in silence...

129
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,260
HERE WE GO!!

130
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,750
SET SAIL!!

131
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,210
LET'S MEET AGAIN, YOU SHITTY BASTARDS!!

132
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,050
As long as you hold the conviction to face death,

133
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,100
then you will definitely find it...

134
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,900
All Blue.

135
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,320
Alright, men!

136
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,090
Customers are coming in soon!

137
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,540
Hurry up and get back to work!

138
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,940
Robin used to always be alone...

139
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,440
Just like I used to be.

140
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,540
Were you shot?

141
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,660
We need to hurry and stop the bleeding or you'll die!

142
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,410
You can be one! You can! You can!

143
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,830
You'll become a great doctor.

144
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,960
Doctor... I can't breathe...

145
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,550
You're so kindhearted!

146
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:51,220
I wonder if Robin ever had anyone, someone like what the Doctor meant to me.

147
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,140
My, my! Aren't you a weird creature?

148
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,270
You probably lived a lonely life, without anyone who liked you, right?

149
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,920
You poor monster!

150
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,730
Why would a lonesome creature like you want to save this country?

151
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,030
Don't make us laugh!

152
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,110
Shut up!

153
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,530
I can fight even without any nakama!

154
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,410
As long as Doctor's flag is here, I will...

155
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,290
He does have nakama!

156
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,670
I AM HIS NAKAMA!!

157
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,730
Oi, you! Let's be pirates together!

158
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,600
It's impossible.

159
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,290
It's not impossible!

160
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,670
It's so much fun!

161
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,110
That doesn't even make sense!

162
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,730
But...

163
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,790
But, I'm a reindeer!

164
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,910
I have antlers, and I have hooves...

165
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,990
I have a blue nose too!

166
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,370
I mean, I wanna be a pirate...

167
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,360
But, I'm not a nakama of humans!

168
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm a monster!

169
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,850
I can't be one of your nakama.

170
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,720
So...

171
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,550
So I just wanted to thank you.

172
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,210
I really appreciate it.

173
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,400
Thanks for inviting me.

174
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,740
I'm gonna stay here, but...

175
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,780
Maybe someday, when you feel like it, you can come back!

176
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,010
SHUT UP!!

177
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,040
LET'S GOt\fs50}!!

178
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,590
I've never heard of an invitation saying 'shut up'.

179
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,310
That felt good!

180
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,830
Oi! Can you do it again?

181
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,780
Stupid, we're leaving now.

182
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
I... I thought we were gonna die...

183
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,700
Hey! Where the hell am I?

184
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,660
Sanji-san, you're awake?

185
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,850
Doctor! It wasn't an hallucination, was it?

186
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,170
Wasn't your research complete?

187
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,090
Or was that a lie, too?

188
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,400
We did it, Chopper!

189
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,970
The research was a success!

190
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,100
Did you think that I'd be sad if you didn't say that before you died?

191
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,350
'Nothing is impossible to a man with a skull on his flag!'

192
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,730
Say it again, Doctor!

193
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,150
Are you ready, youngsters!?

194
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,400
FIRE 'EM!!

195
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,360
Listen, Kureha, this dirt is...

196
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,600
Dr. Kureha...

197
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,830
What in the world are you...?

198
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,370
Just shut up and watch.

199
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,090
Dr. Kureha! We've fired them all!

200
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,210
LIGHT UP!!

201
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,390
Amazing!

202
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,310
Yeah.

203
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,770
Beautiful!

204
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,230
I will make cherry blossoms bloom!

205
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,410
If my research succeeds, this country will be saved!

206
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,830
Listen here, this red dirt...

207
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,530
It's no ordinary dirt.

208
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,290
It'll stick to the white snow,

209
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,460
and will make bright pink snow fall!

210
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,510
Doctor...

211
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,100
Doctorine...

212
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,380
I would never shoot you!

213
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,610
My name is Dr. Hiluluk!

214
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,890
I'm a Doctor!

215
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,590
Tony Tony Chopper...

216
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,730
Great name, isn't it?

217
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,550
That's what I'm gonna call you.

218
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,260
Chopper, you'll be a great Doctor.

219
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I guarantee it!

220
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,230
Even if I die, my dream never will.

221
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,120
What a great life I had!

222
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,290
Thank you, Chopper.

223
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,200
Now, go...

224
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,060
Stupid son...

225
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,110
Robin.

226
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,740
You're not alone anymore, okay?

227
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,020
We'll save you no matter what!

228
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,240
So wait for us!

229
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,620
The sea train?

230
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,640
HERE WE GO!!

231
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,240
The more I want to stay with everyone, the more I'll make them suffer.

232
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,240
It's something I thought I was never allowed to want.

233
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,500
But, Saulo...

234
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,790
You were right!

235
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,530
I finally met the nakama that would protect me!

236
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,170
Next time, One Piece: Everything Is For a Nakama! 
Robin in the Dark!

237
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,510
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

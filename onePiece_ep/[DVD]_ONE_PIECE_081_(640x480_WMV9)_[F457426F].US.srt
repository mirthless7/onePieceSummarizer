1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,050
Be content for you?

2
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,050
The doctor considered as a witch

3
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,360
Please, save my companion!

4
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,920
Please, call a doctor!!

5
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,460
Forgive me not to be myself presented.
I am called Dalton.

6
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,780
I am the captain of the guard of this island.

7
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,810
The only doctor lives as a hermit in this castle at the top of the mountain.

8
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,160
Why is it necessary that she lives so high?

9
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,990
Take care of me, Capitaine.

10
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,370
I was sure. As soon as the captain says something, the navigator follows.

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,530
Yosh, allons-y!
Before Nami dies!

12
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,460
Do not say similar things!

13
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,490
It is of Lapahns that?

14
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,310
Wapol-Sama!

15
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,370
What?

16
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,780
We finally arrived on our premises!

17
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,020
It is our terre natale, the island of Drum!

18
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,090
Nami?

19
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:57,960
Nami-San?

20
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,620
Soon… In Arabasta…

21
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,680
All is well, rendors.

22
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,710
Do not occupy you of nothing for the moment.

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,470
Even if its own life is in danger…

24
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,080
Nami-San, hold good still a little.

25
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,350
It is necessary that one reaches this rotten castle where this doctor saw.

26
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,300
Bar you, rabbits of shit!

27
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,110
They arrive!

28
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,030
Ouais!

29
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,100
Listen, Luffy!

30
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,640
No matter what it arrives, does not attack them.

31
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,770
Why?

32
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,230
Idiot. If you put yourself to attack them or if you are caught a blow,

33
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,810
it is Nami-San which will be directly touched!

34
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,380
And she will die.

35
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,130
COM-included/understood! I will not fight with them!

36
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,340
But then, that do I have to make?

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,930
For the moment, avoids them!

38
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,410
Dodge, dodging, dodging and course!

39
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,130
But does not move back!

40
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,370
It is too difficult!

41
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,050
Shit! This snow prevents me from striking of all my forces!

42
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,590
They all arrive at the same time!

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,780
Sink in wood!
I cover you!

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,510
On the left all! Direction the mountain!

45
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,270
Included/understood.

46
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,510
It is necessary that one finds a means of sowing them!

47
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,020
If one must all do them, one until fell the night from there. Exactly it with what one can expect with animals of snows.

48
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,550
It is without hope!

49
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,670
Imbecile! I said to you not to attack them!!

50
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,540
Leave the-me!

51
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,470
Afflicted…

52
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,320
I do not joke!

53
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,680
Sanji! There is a way up there!

54
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,270
Well! Continuous!

55
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,700
Why does devil you ace do that?

56
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,250
Continue to run until in top!

57
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,300
Ca becomes really dangerous up there.

58
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,190
Made that Nami-San is healthy and safe.

59
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,540
But… which are you thus?

60
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,220
Who we are?

61
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,240
To travel until Large Line with for crew
6 people without doctor…

62
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,010
Ca appears rather absurd.

63
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,510
We are pirates.

64
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,130
It for that you pointed your weapons on us, isn't this is?

65
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,580
Although that is a small crew, As long as the courageous warrior of the sea Usopp-Sama is one as of their, they will never fail!

66
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,540
Oh?

67
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,860
However, we need a doctor.

68
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,660
We thought of meeting one of them on this island
who would become one of our companions, but…

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,570
But which could have thought that your only doctor
is a witch living in a castle?

70
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,340
Which strange combination.

71
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,420
You are certainly not the kind of pirates
which we expected.

72
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,650
Dalton-San!

73
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,690
Dalton-San.

74
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,750
Oh, happy to re-examine you.

75
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,070
You Doctor Kureha, isn't this seeks?

76
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,360
Yes, it is exact.

77
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,050
However, the patient is already…

78
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,200
It is said that it has just gone down
at the close village Cocoaweed.

79
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,310
What did you say?

80
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,400
They come from louper!!

81
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,490
Couldn't He, landlord, you make it conceal?

82
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,300
This kid cries so extremely that I cannot any more support it.

83
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,790
Oh, I am really sorry.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,510
He, Tamachibi, which does arrive to you?

85
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,080
You have some share badly?

86
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,640
I cannot help you as long as you cry.

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,500
You annoy the customers.

88
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,050
Tamachibi, speaks!

89
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,190
I will throw you outside, if you do not stop!

90
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,390
The witch?

91
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,340
The witch…

92
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,670
I am afraid…

93
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,560
And it is still with him…  This alarming monster…

94
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,430
Go! Stop that!

95
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,380
Oya, oya. This child has really an ungrateful father.

96
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,510
When a newborn ceases crying,
that means that its body is sick.

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
Remain behind, Chopper.

98
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,210
Excuse me.

99
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,260
You are content, small snotty-nosed kid?

100
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,320
Dr. Kureha!

101
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,220
The secrecy of my youth?

102
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,770
Not, it was not asked!

103
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,780
I do not manage to believe that it is really 140 years old!

104
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,850
I am always 139 years old!

105
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,730
Do I have to look after it?

106
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,910
To look after which? My son is not at all sick!

107
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,560
You are doctor?

108
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,890
Good, allons-y Chopper.

109
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,730
Wait, please!

110
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,690
Forgive me.
It is an error of my share.

111
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,470
I heard yesterday that the doctor was to come, but

112
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,600
I thought that it would spend several days to go down.

113
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,760
It is not your fault.

114
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,640
The problem it is the superhuman force of Luffy and Sanji!

115
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,650
We would be probably unable of
to follow in top of this mountain.

116
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,510
If the witch is at the village of Cocoaweed, it is necessary to ask him to turn over to its castle immediately!

117
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,100
Yes, you are right.
We do not have an other choice.

118
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,770
Forgive me…

119
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,270
Because this country is without doctor…

120
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,520
Not, not, there is no reason to be excused, Dalton-San.

121
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,550
It is true!

122
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,730
We dispatch!

123
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,350
My hand… I have badly…

124
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,010
Is your hand, it well that?

125
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,870
Whereas do say you that?

126
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,760
My leg!!!

127
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,440
Hold, looks at, you ace more badly with the hand!

128
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,970
What do you believe to make?

129
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,980
be content for you?

130
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,720
Content?

131
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,290
Well. Now remains quiet.

132
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,810
He!

133
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,220
Do not shout, I just touched his leg slightly.

134
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,520
But it was a very strong noise…

135
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,110
It has badly with the hands and the legs.

136
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,010
It does not have a fever.

137
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,290
But its leg swells because of a purulent ignition.

138
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,060
The stage is already quite advanced.

139
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,660
It has a bacteriological infection of the bones.

140
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,350
Chopper, will seek me antibiotics.

141
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,140
D-doctor… My son is…

142
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,830
The treatment sufficiently early of this disease is the key of survival.

143
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,620
You do not worry. It will be left there,

144
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,870
whereas it should have died.

145
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,920
To die?

146
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,830
I will make some incisions,
then would be courageous my boy.

147
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,700
Won't He, you anaesthetize it?

148
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,500
Here your anesthesia.

149
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,520
Made not that!

150
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,240
The drugs make effect well.

151
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,470
There will not be need for treatment additional.

152
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,760
Bandage to him the legs well while it rests.

153
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,540
Once you will have arranged it, keep it cold. Included/understood?

154
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,240
In compensation…

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,540
I am with court of bag-dustbin and toilet paper.

156
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,800
I will take all the food you have here.

157
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,110
And…

158
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,590
I want 50% of the receipts of the capital of this pub.

159
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,440
Chopper, brings all to the sledge.

160
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,210
, You Have-await are not serious?

161
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,750
Half of my capital?

162
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,180
Does not leave it you berner, landlord!

163
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,250
It will strip you!

164
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,940
Ouais, it is sure!

165
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,210
What does she want to say by “should have died”?

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
If that is the newborn made that to cry!

167
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,530
You misuse your statute of doctor!

168
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,150
Ouais, ouais!

169
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,440
Do not benefit from weak people, old witch!

170
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,760
Slept, Chopper!
They are right dirty snotty-nosed kid which râlent.

171
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,190
Grandmother…

172
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,780
I feel much better.

173
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,450
Thank you!

174
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,230
Oya! It would be said that I had a good tip.

175
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,100
I will drop to 49%.

176
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,280
I will pay.

177
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,410
Thank you.

178
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,480
Oh… Kid.

179
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,580
This wellbeing…

180
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,960
Does not forget it!

181
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,940
Yes!

182
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,590
The weather is so cold!!

183
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,770
My body engourdit as if I were on ice!

184
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,570
But I did not finish any yet.

185
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,430
Once my completely emptied spirit, fire will be refreshed,

186
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,580
and the ice will be heated!

187
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,080
He Karu! Go down too!

188
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,830
This drive will make only good with your weak body.

189
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,480
He, there is full of fish down there.

190
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,420
I think that I will go back there.

191
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,620
They continue to arrive?

192
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,420
Not.

193
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,510
Yosha! I suppose that they were sown!

194
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,540
Not.

195
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,320
Incredible!

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,480
What do they make?

197
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,310
They are irritated because they are hungry?

198
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,010
Not…

199
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,840
Wait.

200
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,270
And shit! They go…

201
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,470
You… Now say to us who you are.

202
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,040
It is sure, you do not act like a normal villager.

203
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,970
In fact, when you speak, I feel a soldier.

204
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,560
I was… with the service of the former King.

205
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,770
I was the subordinate of Wapol.

206
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,190
Since the reign of the last king, I was useful as a captain of the guard of this country.

207
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,420
But when the king died,
his/her Wapol son succeeded to him the throne.

208
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,300
And the country changed.

209
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,400
Oh yes! I have just thought of a new brilliant law!

210
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,530
Exile all the doctors of the country!

211
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,180
To exile?

212
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,040
Doctors?

213
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,410
Exactly.

214
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,920
Gather the 20 best doctors and make my personal specialists.

215
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,620
I will call them the “Isshi-20”.

216
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,110
The “Isshi-20”?

217
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes, the “Isshi-20”.

218
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,300
All the other doctors will have to be exiled!

219
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,050
You are brilliant, Wapol-Sama!
What a marvellous idea!

220
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,300
But if one does that, which will deal with the patients?

221
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,630
And what do their diseases have to see with me?

222
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,510
Whoever wants to see a doctor owes prosterner in front of me!

223
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:11,750
There will be nobody any more in this country to be opposed to me!

224
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,270
I am… a genius!

225
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,960
Therefore, whoever falls ill will have to conclude
a market with Wapol to see Isshi-20?

226
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,510
And the price to pay to receive a medical care was enormous.

227
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,230
It is the same thing as to control by taking the inhabitants in hôtage!

228
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,960
It is not a government!

229
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,740
It is a crime.

230
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,580
Yes, without any doubt.

231
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,040
Shit! I made some too much and I swam too far!

232
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,460
Where am I? Where is the boat?

233
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,780
Name of god, there is so much snow here which I have no idea where I am!

234
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,170
Oh! Saved!

235
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,680
He, grandmother, that would disturb you of me
to lead to the city nearest?

236
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,870
But why devil you have the belly with the air
by a similar cold? Insane old woman…

237
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,060
You should pay attention so that you known as.

238
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,170
I am always a young person, too young hundred-thirty year!

239
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,250
Allons-y, Chopper. There are not time to lose with odd people.

240
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
He, wait!

241
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,260
What does not go in this rotten old woman skin?

242
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,150
I am cold!

243
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,620
Shit, I will have problems if I remain here.

244
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,150
I suppose that a muscular drive should heat me.

245
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,540
Me revoilà! I am finally of return in my country!

246
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,910
The kingdom of Drum!

247
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,410
Therefore, they set up a patrol of monitoring.

248
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,740
With what devil did think by drawing us above?

249
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,900
Oh, what a seen for my sensitive eyes, the island of Drum!

250
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,380
Unchanged, majestic, Natural Mother!

251
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,680
Is Chess, the castle healthy and except?

252
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,440
Yes.

253
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,200
It is in the same state that losque we left, Wapol-Sama.

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,930
Then, direction the castle!
Let us turn over to my castle!

255
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,190
I have some to be a pirate enough!
I become again King!

256
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,680
Ahead, Robson!

257
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,810
He, Robson! Stop sleeping and advances!

258
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,720
Go, hurries and advances!

259
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
Wapol-Sama, I have bad news!

260
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,010
What still?

261
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,380
The pirates of yesterday moored their boat with the bank!

262
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,360
What?

263
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,290
This dirty small… What Straw hat
and do its crew make in my kingdom?

264
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,340
Even if they said not to know where it was, they are there!

265
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,430
Release me!

266
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,210
Do they have the least idea of what arrived to me afterwards?

267
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,290
Now, go over there and kill them!

268
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,020
But precisely the boat is completely empty!

269
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,750
What?

270
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,870
One does not know where they are!

271
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,980
You want to be made carry out?

272
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,470
I am really sorry Wapol-Sama.

273
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,670
Please excuse this good with nothing!

274
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,740
Chess. Kuromarimo.

275
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,470
We explored the neighborhoods of the ship in the search of prints.

276
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
We think that they went in Bighorn.

277
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,410
I see. You are geniuses.

278
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,820
Well, we will start by announcing the return of monarchy by a blow of gun to Bighorn!

279
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,310
What you known as?

280
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,810
It already left the village?
One comes from the louper?

281
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,910
What a binding!

282
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,140
She cured my infection.

283
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,310
You seek Doctor Dalton-San?

284
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,710
We have an urgency with a patient.
You know where it went?

285
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,350
Somebody said that Doctor Kureha moved towards Gyasta.

286
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,420
Gyasta?

287
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,620
Where is it?

288
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,670
While crossing by Bighorn, it is opposite.

289
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,050
One still crossed?

290
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,600
Ice-skating is very popular by here.

291
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,050
It does not matter!

292
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,620
I did not ask anything!

293
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,850
The calm one, Usopp-San!

294
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,670
Nevertheless, us should leave.

295
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,210
Now that one arrived up to now, one does not have time to lose.

296
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,470
Ouais, you are right.

297
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,940
Dalton-San?

298
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,470
You were there…

299
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,670
You were not judicious to make the guet today?

300
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,130
What arrives to you? What did it occur?

301
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,780
All the other guards… were killed.

302
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,380
What?

303
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,060
Of only one blow this boat arrived of the ocean and…

304
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,970
They killed everyone!

305
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,780
Who are they?

306
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,010
Calm yourself and say to me who did that to you!

307
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,000
Dalton-San, please, save us!

308
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,620
With our force we cannot…

309
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,570
What does it occur?

310
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,560
It is him?

311
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,740
It is Wapol!

312
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,420
Wapol is of return!

313
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,310
What has it just said?

314
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,260
Is Wapol of return?

315
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,150
Dalton-San!

316
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,770
I will put an end to all that!

317
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,880
I do not intend to play the part of justice here…

318
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,310
You and me guilty sums of the same crime!

319
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,620
You will not go further, Wapol!

320
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,540
They really will do it… these rabbits of shit!

321
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,930
It is not true…

322
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,780
He Sanji. What is there?

323
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,500
What occurs?

324
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,020
He. Course, Luffy.

325
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,750
To run? In which direction?

326
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,110
Anywhere, also far you can!

327
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,160
They will cause an avalanche!

1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,250
Robin!

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,550
Whether you wanna die or not, I don't care about whatever you say!

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,780
Say that kind of thing...

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,450
...while you're by our sides!

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,910
Leave the rest to us!

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,290
They passed through the Aqua Laguna to come here.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,010
If you think about it, it's amazing.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,930
Seems like they're quite lucky.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,330
This time we have permission to kill.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,370
This is gonna be easy if we don't have to hold back.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,310
The drawbridge?

12
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,040
Yeah.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,610
The Franky Family is fighting for it at the moment.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,290
If they lower it, we'll be able to go to the other side at once.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,910
Really...

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,700
She's just in front of our eyes too.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,980
You...

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,120
Geez!

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,400
How much of a burden is this woman carrying?

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,730
Oi, CP9!

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,260
Alright guys!

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,950
I give you the permission to annihilate them, but attack them from this Tower of Justice!

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,030
The first priority is my life, my promotion!

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,450
If these guys go free, if by any chance something happens, who's gonna protect me?

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,440
You tako-pirates!

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,940
Tako, literally meaning octopus, is just used as an insult here.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,280
Even if you try your hardest, there's nothing you can change in the end!

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,630
We have this assassin group, the CP9's strength.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,630
We have the heavy Gates of Justice, impossible to open with mere human power!

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,350
And more importantly...

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,940
At this moment, I hold...

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,800
...the authority to use this Golden Den-Den Mushi,
 and call upon the Buster Call!

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,270
The Buster Call?

34
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,530
That's right...

35
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,650
Exactly twenty years ago,

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,530
it's the power that crushed your homeland, Nico Robin.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,360
The name Ohara...

38
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,890
It disappeared from the next year's map, didn't it?

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,720
Robin's homeland?

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,000
That shitty mask...

41
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,040
I don't have anywhere to go to, nor do I have a place to call home.

42
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,390
Stop!

43
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,890
Anything but that!

44
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,770
That's a nice reaction, it's giving me chills!

45
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,010
What?

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,460
Does that mean you want me to push the Buster Call launching switch?

47
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,880
Do you really understand what will happen if you press that button?

48
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,800
I guess I do...

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,790
The probability of the pirates leaving this island will become zero!

50
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,180
With a single push of this button...

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,430
It's really simple.

52
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,400
It won't end as simply as that!

53
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,710
Are the old memories flowing in?

54
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,760
Then, should I press it for a little test?

55
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,590
Now and here...

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?

57
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,300
STOP IT NOW!!

58
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,030
You shouldn't be so cocky with me...

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,990
Right?

60
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,200
You said Ohara disappeared from the next map, didn't you?

61
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,680
Can you see humans when looking from above on a map?

62
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,040
It's because you are looking upon the world this way...

63
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,870
That's why you can do such a horrible thing!

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,640
The Buster Call is...

65
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,400
It's a ruthless power that loses sight of its target itself.

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,840
You can't use it...

67
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,340
Never...

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,060
Anything but that...

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Robin's Past! 
The Girl who was Called a Demon!

70
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,700
Robin's there!

71
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,050
Let's get her!

72
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:31,910
Ouch...

73
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,470
We did it!

74
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,540
Hey! Monster!

75
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,010
So creepy!

76
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,400
Monster, monster!

77
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,940
Monster, monster!

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,650
I've been attacked by a monster!

79
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,310
She's creepy!

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
We'll remember this!

81
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,740
Hey there.

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,970
My kids came home crying, saying they were beaten
 even though they didn't do anything.

83
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,650
Don't approach my children anymore!

84
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,730
Can't you say anything!?

85
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,450
Geez!

86
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,860
You really are a disgusting girl.

87
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,540
Hold it!

88
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,350
Our conversation isn't over!

89
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,410
Hey, hey! What's for dinner today?

90
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,070
What do you want to eat?

91
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,230
I want, I want...

92
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,620
Home rice!

93
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
You really like home rice!

94
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,380
Yeah!

95
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,850
Then I'll need to make a lot.

96
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,350
Yay!

97
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,570
I'm home.

98
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,920
Sorry for being late.

99
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,270
Aunt Roji?

100
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,150
To Robin.

101
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:40,970
Today is...

102
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,580
...our daughter's birthday,

103
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,370
so the three of our family, without any intruders,

104
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,290
have decided to go out for dinner.

105
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,600
There's bread left for your dinner, so eat it properly.

106
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,250
Be sure not to use too much jam.

107
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,060
When you're done eating and before we get back home,

108
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,150
wash the plates,

109
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,190
clean the house,

110
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,480
bring the laundry inside,

111
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,610
and be sure to go upstairs before it gets too late.

112
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,100
Hey, hey! What's for dinner today?

113
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,630
What do you want to eat?

114
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,550
I want, I want...

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,890
Home rice!

116
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,040
You really like home rice!

117
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,720
Yeah!

118
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,040
Then I'll need to make a lot!

119
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,650
Yay!

120
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,570
She's here, it's Robin.

121
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,460
It seems like she came to return a book.

122
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,000
Everyone, get in place!

123
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,080
Good evening.

124
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,140
Professor Clover, I came to return the book...

125
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,850
One, two!

126
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,220
Robin, congratulations!!

127
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,850
You're amazing, Robin!

128
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,970
As expected from a genius!

129
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,230
We've got a cake! A cake!

130
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,610
Robin.

131
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,040
The doctor's degree archeology test you took the other day...

132
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,090
You got a perfect score!

133
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,790
From today on, you are finally recognized as an archeologist!

134
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,820
Starting from today, you are one of our companions who'll work on research with us.

135
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,620
Here, this is the proof that you are a scholar.

136
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,070
Take it, Robin.

137
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,630
This is great, Robin.

138
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,030
Congratulations!

139
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,100
Alright, Robin.

140
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,240
You must know well what being an archeologist is about!

141
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,400
Yes, Professor Clover.

142
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,720
Knowledge is namely the past.

143
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,380
Those numerous books...

144
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,440
They traveled for a long time to be accumulated here,

145
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,850
as they came from all across the globe to this five thousand year old Tree of Omniscience.

146
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,790
For the entirety of humanity, they are irreplaceable assets!

147
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,350
This is the world's largest, greatest library, that holds pride in the knowledge it contains!

148
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,160
And gathered under this Tree of Omniscience are brave archeologists.

149
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,560
Since we are using these documents,

150
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,020
there is no historical mystery unsolvable for us!

151
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,340
Do you understand, Robin?

152
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,320
Yes.

153
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,320
In the research that'll appear on our road later on,

154
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,570
you'll contribute to the world by understanding other cultures.

155
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,180
Professor, I want to solve the mystery of the Void History!

156
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,750
You can't, you can't!

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,430
That has always been forbidden!

158
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,790
Why?

159
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,090
If we study the Poneglyphes,

160
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,090
we'll know what happened during the Void Century, right?

161
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,910
Why do you know so much?

162
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,520
You used your ability to spy on us in the basement once again!

163
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,530
But...

164
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,220
Any action taken to decipher the Poneglyphes is considered a great crime!

165
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,670
We should be beheaded!

166
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,500
But...

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,260
Isn't everyone gathering in the basement late at night...

168
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,590
...to do research on the Poneglyphes?

169
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,360
Robin...!

170
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,270
Why do you know such a thing?

171
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,570
What does this mean?

172
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,410
Are you saying that you peeked on all of that too?

173
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,370
Answer me, Robin!

174
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,000
But...

175
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,780
Even if I asked you clearly, you wouldn't let me inside!

176
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,330
That's why...

177
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,100
I thought that if I became a real archeologist,

178
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,490
I would be accepted as everyone's research companion.

179
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,860
I tried hard too...

180
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,120
Robin...

181
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,240
Indeed...

182
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,690
You have earned enough knowledge to be called an archeologist.

183
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,110
But you are still just a kid.

184
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,480
If you are found working with us, you'll be beheaded.

185
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,700
This is something we're doing, being fully prepared.

186
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,890
Since eight hundred years ago, when this became the law of the world,

187
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,860
there have been as many scholars who lost their lives trying to uncover the truth as there are stars in the sky.

188
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,560
This is a good opportunity.

189
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,900
I will tell you about it.

190
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,190
Those who are able to decipher those ancient, historical writings,

191
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,910
are those in Ohara alone.

192
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,190
We can't go back anymore.

193
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,760
Swear on the Tree of Omniscience!

194
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,300
The next time you approach the basement,

195
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,740
we will forbid you from entering the research center and the library!

196
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,790
You got it?

197
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:49,990
Robin!

198
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,530
She's completely following in her mother's shadow.

199
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,360
She still doesn't know about the incident that occurred a few days ago.

200
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,510
Robin's mother, Olvia, has already been captured.

201
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,630
We can already predict her fate.

202
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,550
W... Water...

203
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,320
Earthworm?

204
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,980
Mizu = Water, Mimizu = Earthworm

205
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,690
Delicious!

206
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,200
That saved my life...

207
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,060
I wonder if that person's safe too...

208
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,510
Anyway, ya saved me.

209
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,840
Thanks.

210
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,680
There must be a town 'round here.

211
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,010
I see...

212
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,640
In any case, I wanted to drift to a deserted island or somethin'.

213
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,910
Even if ya stand there still, nothin' will happen.

214
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,540
I injured my leg.

215
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,590
So I won't move from here.

216
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,600
I plan on buildin' a raft or somethin' to get outta here while I can.

217
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,560
Is this your first time seein' a giant?

218
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,890
I'll warn you now, don't judge me as bein' like
 those barbaric giants from Elbaf.

219
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,630
There are peaceful giant clans too, ya know...

220
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,030
I'll try askin' ya somethin' impossible, but...

221
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,670
I'd like ya not to talk about me to anyone once ya get home.

222
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,310
Understood.

223
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,830
That answer was too fast.

224
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,800
That's absolutely impossible.

225
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,820
I won't tell.

226
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,690
That's a lie.

227
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,190
There's no way a kid can protect a secret!

228
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,290
But I'm...

229
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,200
...not interested in you.

230
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,950
Dereshi?

231
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,060
What does that mean?

232
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,460
What are ya talkin' about? I'm laughin'!

233
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,420
You are laughing?

234
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,380
You're an interestin' one!

235
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,640
That's a weird way to laugh.

236
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,360
Since long ago, I've been told a lot that the way I laugh is awkward.

237
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,560
Ain't ya cute when you laugh?

238
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,220
It'd be better if ya laughed more!

239
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,020
I go by the name of Saulo.

240
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm Hagwarl D. Saulo.

241
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,600
D?

242
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,810
Yeah.

243
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,970
I don't really know much about it.

244
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,570
Everyone in my family line's got it.

245
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,430
What's your name?

246
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,710
Robin.

247
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,750
I see.

248
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,370
Robin, the truth is that I'm bein' pursued by some people.

249
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,240
So I'll be in deep trouble if someone finds me.

250
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,160
I won't tell anyone.

251
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,600
Delicious!

252
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,020
Here's one more.

253
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,940
The intention alone makes me glad.

254
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,630
You eat the rest.

255
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,100
My stomach is alright now.

256
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,870
I got some fish and ate it last night.

257
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,240
Alright, it's almost complete.

258
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,640
I'll continue buildin' my raft!

259
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,250
But...

260
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,240
Aren't ya bored?

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,390
Ya come here to keep me company all day long.

262
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,990
Your friends and parents might get suspicious about it.

263
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,500
I don't have any parents.

264
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,330
I have a mother, but she's been sailing the 
seas for her job since I was little.

265
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,890
I don't even remember her face.

266
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,970
I like every one of the archeologists,

267
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,030
but they won't let me join their research, so I'm being left out.

268
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,600
As for the kids in town...

269
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,040
They say I'm creepy, so they won't play with me.

270
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,470
So you are a Devil Fruit user.

271
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,720
Aren't you scared?

272
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,100
I once sailed the Grand Line.

273
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,380
I've seen lots of amazing Devil Fruit users there.

274
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,120
I see.

275
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,070
I'm jealous!

276
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,030
It looks handy!

277
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,540
That's really a weird way to laugh.

278
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,090
Be it funny or not...

279
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,730
Ya know,

280
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,330
when ya laugh, you can be happy.

281
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,050
Why is that?

282
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,800
Even if ya ask why...

283
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,120
When you're happy, laugh!

284
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,820
Which also means that if ya laugh you'll become happy!

285
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,740
Even though you're so small, you look like you're suffering a lot.

286
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,450
Ya just need to laugh!

287
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,850
When you're sad, just laugh!

288
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,750
If I laugh when I'm in pain, I'll look like an idiot.

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,330
That's not true!

290
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,860
See, you can test it for yourself too!

291
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:57,990
Dereshi!

292
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,330
Right, right! That's how ya do it!

293
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,360
You're good, you're good!

294
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,710
This is the Marine Headquarters.

295
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,250
Chief Spandine, I request an answer.

296
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,190
They're asking for you, Chief.

297
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,520
Let them be.

298
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,660
It must just be to check on our situation.

299
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,210
I told them we'd contact them first when we see the coastline.

300
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,180
I don't care whether it's Ohara or Opera,

301
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,500
but why did I have to go all the way to West Blue?

302
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,920
Really...

303
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,470
It's not even a job worth my time...

304
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,550
Ya don't even remember your mom's face?

305
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,670
But I want to meet her.

306
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,580
So your mom is an archeologist too?

307
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,200
She's on a journey to find history no one knows about.

308
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,420
W-What is your mom's name?

309
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,500
Next time, One Piece: The Fated Parent and Child!
 The Mother's Name is Olvia!

310
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,730
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

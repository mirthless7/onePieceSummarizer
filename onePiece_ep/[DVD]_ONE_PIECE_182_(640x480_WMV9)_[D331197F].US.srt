1
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,960
It…

2
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,210
It is not God only
people fear.

3
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,640
It is the terror which it incarnates.

4
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,070
Zoro!

5
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,930
30.000.000 VOLT

6
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,009
The drum…

7
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,740
HINO

8
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,199
Why remainders you upright?

9
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,430
For my ancestors!

10
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,010
I am to you!

11
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,879
I cannot?

12
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,129
He, Zoro!

13
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,789
You insane what?!

14
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,780
WIPER!

15
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,470
Skypiea will be destroyed.

16
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,550
It will turn over to surface.

17
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,190
Our village too?

18
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,039
All.

19
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,430
Here the Arch, Maxim!

20
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,240
I hear them.

21
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,180
It must be Nami and Eneru.

22
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,240
Take me along
over there!

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:19,880
The Last Confrontation!
The Pirate Luffy VS Eneru God!!

24
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,430
I see Angel Island.

25
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,540
[Note:Heso = navel]

26
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,680
Pagaya and his/her daughter, heretics having
clerk of the sacrileges towards God…

27
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,100
like their accomplice, the old one
God Gan Fall, are escaped!

28
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,820
Please remain on your guards!

29
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,689
If one of you sees these fugitive,

30
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,559
please, inform me,
McKinley, immediately!

31
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,900
Contact please
McKinley for any information!

32
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,939
In the name of Eneru God,

33
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,200
us, White Berets, us
will defend the peace of Skypiea!

34
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,529
Heso!

35
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,780
Ah, they is good to know
that one can count on them.

36
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,199
But that does not reassure me.

37
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,130
And if the fugitive ones
hid among us?

38
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,240
Let us be us subjected
with the Judgment of God?

39
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,100
Report/ratio! Report/ratio!

40
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,559
That there
does it have?

41
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,520
Dear Sir, we have just been informed…

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,689
What?!

43
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,490
The girl of Pagaya
bring closer to the quays?!

44
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,880
The heretic entered
by the door number 1!

45
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,149
Why?

46
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,360
Why it returns,
knowing what will it be captured?

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,980
Do not let it escape
! Capture it at all costs!

48
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,460
Bring yourself, fugitive!

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,860
LET PASS TO ME, PLEASE!

50
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,240
What you make?!
You draw aside!

51
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,839
WHAT?!

52
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,710
CAPTAIN!

53
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,930
CAPTAIN!!

54
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,309
NR… Not.

55
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,129
McKinley captain!

56
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,179
It is the fugitive one!

57
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,699
It is the girl who
was opposed to God!

58
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,749
Does not approach you!

59
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,310
The Judgment approaches!!

60
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,719
Which quantity of incredible gold.

61
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,969
While listening on Angel Beach,

62
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,250
it would be said that the girl causes
much agitation on Angel Island.

63
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,359
Conis?

64
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,349
But how?

65
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,650
Conis should be on our boat.

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,540
There is much noise outside.

67
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,440
What? It is only one
small complication.

68
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,600
Then, this capacity of Mantra
that you have all…

69
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,029
Ca enables you to find
a person in particular?

70
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,290
He well, I would not say
not that it is perfect.

71
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,950
I am an exception.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,249
In addition to my powerful Mantra,

73
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,420
my capacities of the lightning enable me to create electric waves and to hear the conversations.

74
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,470
When I intend somebody to say a thing which it would not have owed, I inflict my Judgment to him.

75
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,210
The extent of my hearing is sufficiently
large to cover all the country.

76
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,559
It is thus like that.

77
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,310
It is an aptitude which
God must have.

78
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,900
Will run as much as you
will want, people of the sky!

79
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,149
It is the ultimate song of Skypiea!

80
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,530
Festivities of
dancing angels of the sky!

81
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:29,410
You over there, you already saw the expression of one
mortal who loses balance suddenly?

82
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,659
It is what its problem?

83
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,170
It is what its problem? It is what
its problem? It is what its problem?

84
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,959
What do I have to make?

85
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,589
I must flee from here, if not…

86
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,959
Not. Even if I flee,

87
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,469
the celestial island is on
the point to be destroyed.

88
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,120
There is not only
I can make?

89
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,820
Hein? I…

90
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,400
Doesn't something go?

91
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,050
Who is this?

92
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,420
Not, it is nothing.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,890
Please! I you
in requests, listen to me!

94
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,429
Goes you in! Does not approach you!

95
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,149
You all! Listen to me, I request from you!

96
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,739
We have little time!

97
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,819
Please!

98
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,599
You calm and
listen to me!

99
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,660
Close it! Goes you in!

100
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,039
Leave this island, species of plague!

101
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes! If you remainders here, us
all will be subjected to the Judgment!

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,090
Heretic!

103
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,189
Ouais!

104
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,789
Goes you in from here!

105
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,499
Release!!

106
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,840
Not. Pity, listen to me… I…

107
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,820
You do not approach more.

108
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,580
It is a bazooka-flame.

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,740
I will draw!

110
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,730
You all, please! You must
to join Cloud End on bank of the cloud…

111
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,939
and to flee towards
Blue sea immediately!

112
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,069
This country is to two
fingers to be destroyed!

113
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,189
A minute ago to lose!

114
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,640
Please, use all the boats
that you will find and leave Angel Island!

115
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,640
Which is this madness?

116
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,960
Eneru God with the intention
to destroy this country!

117
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,700
While remaining here, NONE
will not survive us!

118
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,620
Hah! It is anything!

119
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,999
You try to swindle us?!

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,089
It is to avenge you?!

121
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,829
There are certain things on
which one cannot joke!

122
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,580
You take to us for imbeciles?!

123
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,250
Do not miss a respect
towards Eneru God!

124
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,110
Forgiveness…

125
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,979
What?

126
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,250
It released its weapon?

127
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,909
He! Stop it!

128
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,419
Yes.

129
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,489
I…

130
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:05,330
I DO NOT WANT a ENERU LIKE GOD!

131
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,830
Father…

132
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,849
It became insane?!

133
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,689
You put at the shelter!

134
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,299
Reprocess! Reprocess!

135
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,960
You move away from it! 
Judgment of God approaches!

136
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,820
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

137
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,370
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

138
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,429
Hein?

139
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,380
It is odd.

140
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,049
The Judgment does not arrive.

141
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,099
Why?

142
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,080
After all these sacrileges towards God…

143
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,519
That
does it pass?

144
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,770
Because there is no more
reason that it only kills to me.

145
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,609
“Skypiea will be destroyed.”

146
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,359
A Soldier who is
flee of Upper Yard…

147
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,780
its life sacrificed to inform us.

148
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,110
He…

149
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,810
He and my father underwent
the Judgment together.

150
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,119
Did God do what?

151
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,650
That
does it pass?

152
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,400
Isn't God supposed to help us?

153
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,050
What says this woman?

154
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,419
We do not have time.

155
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,970
You all, please go
towards bank of the cloud, Cloud End.

156
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,070
How is this possible?

157
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,440
Wait a little!

158
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,709
It is impossible!

159
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,339
We have need of time!

160
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,849
We all are born here and
we grew in the sky!

161
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,429
To give up that now is… (that would be ptet to better put:all to give up it now is…)

162
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,019
Yes! It rightly!

163
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,699
Moreover, one is never
gone on the Blue Sea!

164
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,189
How we could
to live over there?

165
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,070
Then you count
to wait here and die?!

166
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,030
You have all considering the kind of man who is
Eneru during this incident six years ago!

167
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,450
After such a declaration, it
will put its words at execution!

168
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:24,999
If that continues…!

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,119
It east cannot be not so serious.

170
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,409
A miracle will arrive can be…

171
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,949
and the celestial island will be saved.

172
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes.

173
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,289
God goes can be to change opinion.

174
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,209
Yes, it is that.

175
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,430
Then can be…

176
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,479
Over all, us
always knew…

177
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,810
that it has the capacity of us
to bring despair!

178
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,650
And this time, it is for soon!

179
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,230
What good is it to await a miracle?!

180
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,440
We know all that our country
does not have God in this moment!

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Before requesting,

182
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,829
before closing the eyes on reality,

183
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,150
we must initially make
what is in our capacity!

184
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,000
We cannot hide us
behind its victims to survive!

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,570
If we do not do anything,

186
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,000
it does not matter with which it fault,
we will have lost our lives!

187
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,299
Now,

188
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,290
you must be solved
to leave this country!

189
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,759
Will run towards the Blue Sea!

190
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,449
To gather your business!

191
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,429
All worms the bank of the cloud, Cloud End!

192
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,769
Made what she says!

193
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,309
Quickly!

194
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,260
Time ago to lose!

195
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,880
He, Miss!

196
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,439
You know what are
become Soldiers?

197
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,589
My husband is one of them!

198
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,029
I want to flee with him!

199
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,819
My son is too!

200
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,489
Are the Soldiers well?

201
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,239
My single son too!
He is always over there!

202
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,890
Hum, I…

203
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,779
The Soldiers are surely already…

204
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,989
I do not know.

205
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,959
Then, that the Soldiers make over there?

206
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,909
Where are they?

207
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,240
You can nothing say to us?

208
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,510
Please, one deals with
Soldiers, us them White Berets!

209
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,220
We will bring back them for you
healthy and safe!

210
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,240
Please, leave! You
must benefit from it to flee!

211
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,599
McKinley captain!

212
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,159
You dispatch please!

213
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,059
Captain…

214
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,210
I have my little idea on the subject
fate reserved to the Soldiers.

215
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,439
Eneru is this kind of man.

216
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,399
I always knew it.

217
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,480
But now, it is imperative that the citizens of this island find a refuge quickly.

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,739
I will not only allow this
island becomes another Bilka.

219
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,819
Bilka?

220
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,569
A celestial island far in South-east.

221
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,360
Eneru was born and grew on this island.

222
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,620
Me was told that it had disappeared
without leaving traces six years ago.

223
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,619
Six years…

224
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,619
Ca wants to say that…

225
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,659
Yes.

226
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,350
Eneru destroyed its own country
native and settled here.

227
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,999
It was said that Bilka lodged
many powerful warriors,

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,880
But before Eneru, they
did not have any capacity.

229
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,490
God without equal.

230
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,420
It east can be true.

231
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,679
I am sure that you are already conscious…

232
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,430
that we all were members of
Soldiers with the service of Gan Fall-sama.

233
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,980
While betraying the Soldiers, us
lent oath towards Eneru.

234
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,860
We thought that while remaining on the island,
we could protect the citizens.

235
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,149
But in the final analysis, even that…

236
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,350
was a poor wretch failure!

237
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,659
We tried to prevent all it
world to cause the anger of God.

238
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,030
We hoped that if
nobody disobeyed to him…

239
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,830
It was all that
we could make!

240
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,199
Failure!

241
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,199
A failure!

242
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,510
A failure!!

243
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,600
Only a failure!!

244
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,560
Ca was not a failure.

245
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,420
I am content with
you to intend to say that.

246
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,750
There is not to have shame.

247
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,859
You did what you
thought of being best for all,

248
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,750
then would owe us
rather to thank you.

249
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,010
Captain.

250
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,349
Can I leave you
you to occupy of all that?

251
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,769
Yes, of course.

252
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,889
Where do you go?

253
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,310
In fact, there are some people
who do not know how to flee from here.

254
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,640
They are my friends.

255
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,630
I must join them!

256
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,520
Take care of you!

257
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,860
Of course! Blue sailors!

258
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,810
Heso!

259
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,540
Heso!

260
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,920
I will not be able all
to move at the same time.

261
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,840
We must at least reach
higher layers.

262
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,800
In any case, we must flee.

263
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,180
Aisa!

264
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,779
Be sure that it is to you by there, hein?!

265
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,569
Yes!

266
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,159
One is there almost!

267
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,699
I am sure that it is by there!

268
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,940
Well!

269
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,829
It is that, Luffy!

270
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,159
The hole on your left!

271
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,539
Ca! Over there!

272
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,749
It is over there that they are?!

273
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,700
WELL!

274
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,090
It is what I thought, they were not
not among the five survivors.

275
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,140
Did brothel, where hide?

276
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,410
This would be…

277
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,680
What a poor unbearable!

278
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,230
Ca wants to say that my
prediction was false.

279
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,699
It IS YOU…

280
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,030
THAT ONE CALLS ENERU?!

281
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,120
Luffy!!!

282
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,999
But what you made ace…

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,560
with my companions?

284
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,380
About which waste do speak you?

285
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,219
Do not move!

286
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,849
I will assemble to you botter the bottom!

287
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,599
You should moderate your words!

288
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,599
I am God.

289
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
In what you are God?!

290
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,349
He causes Eneru deliberately…

291
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,310
Will Ca go, Luffy?

292
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,000
Wait, Luffy!

293
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,570
Pay to!

294
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,940
I hear the festivities of the angels!

295
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,230
It would be said that the citizens of Skypiea
took note of their destiny.

296
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,480
I wonder until where they will be able to run before the ground does not collapse right under their feet.

297
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,620
I You AI REQUESTED IN WHAT YOU WERE GOD?!

298
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,910
You go soon the knowledge.

299
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,719
I see.

300
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,759
You are not human ordinary.

301
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,599
But a paramécia type.

302
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,330
You are not size vis-a-vis me!

303
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,070
Nothing can resist to me…

304
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,420
because I am God!

305
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,170
EL THOR

306
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,170
[Note:God norse of the thunder]

307
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,370
LUFFY!!

308
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,310
Luffy… Not…

309
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,099
I am impressed that
you could dodge that.

310
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,179
60.000.000 VOLT

311
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,740
What? He dodged?

312
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,480
[Note:God of the thunder
aboriginals of Arnhem]

313
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,790
100.000.000 VOLT VARI

314
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,119
It is that!

315
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,789
In there reflective, I would have
had to think of it earlier!

316
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,120
The lightning does not have any effect on Luffy!

317
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,829
It is out of rubber!

318
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,500
STOP YOUR TOMFOOLERIES!!

319
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,139
The calm one!

320
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,540
Physical attacks
will not affect my body!

321
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,510
From there, it
monkey of the Blue Sea…

322
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
It completely inhibited
its capacities of the lightning!

323
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,510
Eneru probably never has
imagined that somebody on ground…

324
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,910
could not be
affected by the lightning.

325
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,010
Luffy east can be only on
ground with being able to beat Eneru…

326
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,960
Its natural enemy!

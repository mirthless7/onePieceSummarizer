1
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:02,713
What?

2
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,464
Whew, this is heavy.

3
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:05,841
What is that?

4
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:06,967
I found these in the storage room.

5
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:07,134
I found these in the storage room.

6
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:09,678
Aren't those cannonballs?

7
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:13,640
I figured we could practice using
our hard earned cannon.

8
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,934
Then I'll take care of it.

9
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,395
I think I was 3...

10
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:21,273
Traveling half-way around the world,
riding on a cannonball...

11
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:21,490
Traveling half-way around the world,
riding on a cannonball...

12
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,566
How do you use this.

13
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,650
Listen to me!
How do you use this.

14
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:26,528
Hey Zoro! Do you know how to use this?

15
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:29,197
He's been sleeping for a while.

16
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,034
No fun.

17
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:32,659
If we go a little south, there's
a perfect place for practicing.

18
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,663
If we go a little south, there's
a perfect place for practicing.

19
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,623
Really? Let's go, let's go!

20
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,752
Hey, can you shoot cannons as well as I can?

21
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:45,547
People called me the cannon master...

22
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:46,757
Listen!

23
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:48,634
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

24
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:48,717
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

25
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:48,800
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:48,925
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

27
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:55,057
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

28
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:55,182
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

29
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:55,265
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

30
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:55,307
THE PAST OF THE THREE SWORDS!
THE PROMISE BETWEEN ZORO AND KUINA!

31
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:16,703
Anyone here?

32
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:19,603
Anyone here!?

33
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,376
I am a doujouyaburi.

34
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:03,376
(Doujouyaburi - someone that challenge a dojo and defeats all it's members.)

35
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:24,294
Any strong person come forth!

36
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:25,837
Come and fight me!

37
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,676
It's pretty rare to see a doujouyaburi these days.

38
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:30,717
Hmm! Don't underestimate
me just because I'm a kid.

39
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:32,928
Hmm! Don't underestimate
me just because I'm a kid.

40
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,012
I'm undefeated in all of nearby towns.

41
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,055
I'm undefeated in all of nearby towns.

42
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:35,597
I'm undefeated in all of nearby towns.

43
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:35,639
I'm undefeated in all of nearby towns.

44
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:35,889
I'm undefeated in all of nearby towns.

45
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:37,015
That's fine.

46
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:38,809
We accept your challenge.

47
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:38,850
We accept your challenge.

48
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,185
If I win, I'll take your signboard.

49
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,311
If I win, I'll take your signboard.

50
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:41,395
If I win, I'll take your signboard.

51
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:42,595
If you lose?

52
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:43,395
Lose...

53
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,107
If that happens, lets see...

54
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:46,775
I will join this place.

55
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:48,986
That is acceptable.

56
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,070
That is acceptable.

57
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:50,970
Then!

58
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,239
Kuina!

59
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,201
Yes, father.

60
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:57,828
What's the hell?

61
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:57,995
You're not the one fighting?

62
00:03:57,995 --> 00:03:58,203
You're not the one fighting?

63
00:03:58,203 --> 00:04:00,205
You're not the one fighting?

64
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:01,832
Even though Kuina is a girl, she is stronger
than the adults in the dojo.

65
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:05,127
Even though Kuina is a girl, she is stronger
than the adults in the dojo.

66
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:05,460
Even though Kuina is a girl, she is stronger
than the adults in the dojo.

67
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,879
I'm not a father that brags about his daughter.

68
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,076
I got it!

69
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:13,176
Then, please come inside.

70
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,556
I can use any of these right?

71
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:18,807
As you please.

72
00:04:22,686 --> 00:04:24,313
Then, let's begin!

73
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,857
Yes, come and try me.

74
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:26,982
Yes, come and try me.

75
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:29,067
Bow to the Gods.

76
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,402
Bow to the Gods.

77
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,821
Is he stupid?

78
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:33,655
Bow to the opponent.

79
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:34,448
Bow to the opponent.

80
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,548
Begin!

81
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:55,260
Da-damn!

82
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,788
You...

83
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,688
have been taught two-sword techniques?

84
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:08,106
I wouldn't know!

85
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,775
Today is the first time I ever held a shinai.
(Shinai - bamboo sword.)

86
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:10,317
Today is the first time I ever held a shinai.
(Shinai - bamboo sword.)

87
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,617
The first time ever?

88
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:14,863
Damn!

89
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:15,530
I'm strong, and I'll become stronger!

90
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,617
I'm strong, and I'll become stronger!

91
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,619
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

92
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:20,661
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

93
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:20,952
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

94
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:21,370
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

95
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:21,411
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

96
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:21,453
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

97
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:21,536
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

98
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:21,620
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

99
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:21,703
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

100
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:22,079
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

101
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,788
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

102
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:23,288
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

103
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:23,497
How... how can I Iose to this girl?!!

104
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,754
Why isn't he dodging?

105
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:32,756
Single blow!

106
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:33,856
Stop!

107
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,426
This kid is like a boar.

108
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:38,178
Hey, Kuina.

109
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:39,554
A poser like you...

110
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:41,390
Is ten years too early to wIeld two swordsl

111
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,224
Is ten years too early to wIeld two swordsl

112
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:45,575
What?!!!

113
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:48,675
What?

114
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,275
Do you want to go for another round?

115
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,318
Shit... a loss Is a loss.

116
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,736
Shit... a loss Is a loss.

117
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:55,737
Good, very straight forward.

118
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,114
Good, very straight forward.

119
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:57,914
Then...

120
00:05:57,914 --> 00:05:59,700
Okay, l'll join this place.

121
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:00,867
Any problems with that?

122
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:00,909
Any problems with that?

123
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,209
I don't.

124
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,509
I'll...

125
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:06,999
Continue, continue, continue to train.

126
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,040
Continue, continue, continue to train.

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,165
Continue, continue, continue to train.

128
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:07,207
Continue, continue, continue to train.

129
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:07,916
Continue, continue, continue to train.

130
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,583
And I will beat you!

131
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:08,709
And I will beat youI

132
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,294
And I will beat you!

133
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:13,588
Remember that!

134
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:17,384
That'll never happen.

135
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,984
(DOJO)

136
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:16,610
Single blow!

137
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,810
Stop!

138
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:19,738
Winner, Kuina!

139
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:19,988
2000 wins, 0 losses!

140
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:20,072
2000 wins, 0 losses!

141
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:20,197
2000 wins, 0 losses!

142
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,740
2000 wins, 0 losses!

143
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,409
Da... Damn.

144
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:24,451
You're weak as usual, Zoro.

145
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,428
You're weak as usual, Zoro.

146
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:29,956
How can you be so weak...

147
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:31,356
as a man.

148
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:36,588
Zoro isn't weak, right?

149
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,340
He the strongest among the male students, right?

150
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,924
He the strongest among the male students, right?

151
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:40,509
He even wins against adults.

152
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,636
However, he's weaker than me.

153
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:43,261
However, he's weaker than me.

154
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,223
Even with two katanas,

155
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:46,390
a weak guy is a weak guy.

156
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,515
a weak guy is a weak guy.

157
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:46,807
a weak guy is a weak guy.

158
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:47,391
a weak guy is a weak guy.

159
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:47,432
a weak guy is a weak guy.

160
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:47,516
a weak guy is a weak guy.

161
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:47,557
a weak guy is a weak guy.

162
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:47,641
a weak guy is a weak guy.

163
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,350
a weak guy is a weak guy.

164
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:52,396
A dog that loses should stay quiet, barking
about it only makes it look more pitiful.

165
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,241
You've lost again.

166
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:04,700
Zoro, you have gotten a lot stronger.

167
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:04,866
Zoro, you have gotten a lot stronger.

168
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:05,951
Zoro, you have gotten a lot stronger.

169
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,120
Zoro, you have gotten a lot stronger.

170
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,415
Sensei, you're not giving her special training
just because she's your daughter are you?

171
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,917
Sensei, you're not giving her special training
just because she's your daughter are you?

172
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:14,751
That's not fair!

173
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:14,835
That's not fair!

174
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:15,419
No, I wouldn't do something like that.

175
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:15,627
No, I wouldn't do something like that.

176
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:15,669
No, I wouldn't do something like that.

177
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:15,877
No, I wouldn't do something like that.

178
00:08:15,877 --> 00:08:17,504
No, I wouldn't do something like that.

179
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,008
It's true that Zoro has gotten stronger.

180
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:21,758
However, Kuina also has gotten stronger.

181
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:21,925
However, Kuina also has gotten stronger.

182
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:25,137
However, Kuina also has gotten stronger.

183
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:25,178
However, Kuina also has gotten stronger.

184
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:26,478
Zoro...

185
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:27,228
Zoro?

186
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm going to wash my face.

187
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:37,816
Damn!

188
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:38,400
Why can't I beat Kuina?

189
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,067
Why can't I beat Kuina?

190
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,193
Why can't I beat Kuina?

191
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:41,903
Why?! Why?!

192
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,781
I'm going to become the strongest man in the world!

193
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:44,865
I'm going to become the strongest man in the world!

194
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:45,824
Why?!

195
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:50,704
Tonight...

196
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:53,332
I will duel her once more.

197
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:56,918
It's only been a year since he joined...

198
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:57,044
It's only been a year since he joined...

199
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:59,588
It's only been a year since he joined...

200
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,090
Zoro's progress is unbelievable.

201
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,719
He practices a lot more than anyone else.

202
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,847
The outcome of his training is quite expected...

203
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:13,477
However, he still can't defaat Kuina.

204
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:18,106
There's a huge wall blocking a
female swordsman's future.

205
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,567
Under the current circumstances,

206
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,487
I can't let her inherit the dojo.

207
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,516
Father!

208
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,616
Kuina san!

209
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:30,577
You shouldn't eavesdrop, Kuina.

210
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,582
I will become the world's greatest
swordsman to show you!

211
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:39,252
Kurina..

212
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,252
a woman...

213
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:45,592
will not be able to become the world's best.

214
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:08,158
Zoro...

215
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,158
What are you doing here?

216
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,661
That's what I wanted to ask you.

217
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,830
What are you doing here during
this time of the night?

218
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,128
I came here to request our 2001st battle.

219
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,631
For this will be our last duel.

220
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:26,758
Let's end this.

221
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,635
Fight me with a real sword!

222
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,762
You do have a real sword, right?

223
00:10:33,473 --> 00:10:34,266
With me?

224
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:40,689
Fine!

225
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,580
Wado Ichimonji

226
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:02,377
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

227
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:09,468
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

228
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,025
Two real swords must be heavy.

229
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:07,776
Two real swords must be heavy.

230
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,697
It seems like you still lack a bit of stamina.

231
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:13,997
Shut up!

232
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,006
This is my 2001st win.

233
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,348
Damn!

234
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,848
Shit.

235
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:45,147
I can't accept this...

236
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,945
I'm the one who wants to cry
because I can't accept it.

237
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,445
Girls...

238
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,579
when we grow up, we become weaker than men.

239
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:04,166
I'll probably be overtaken by you soon.

240
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:10,255
You always said you'd become the
best swordsman in the world.

241
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,383
My father told me that...

242
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,345
it's not possible for a woman.

243
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,863
I know...

244
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,141
I already know about this.

245
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,186
But... but, I can't accept it!

246
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:27,397
Zoro, it must be nice to be a man.

247
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:31,109
I also want to become the world's
greatest swordsman.

248
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:34,863
My chest is starting to grow out.

249
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,159
If... If I was born a boy..

250
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:43,830
After beating me, how can
you say such weak words!

251
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:46,166
That's despicable!

252
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,669
You've been my goal all this time!

253
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:49,469
Zoro...

254
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,753
Weather you're a man or a woman...

255
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:51,254
Weather you're a man or a woman...

256
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:54,341
Is that what you're going to say
when I beat you one day?!

257
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,134
As if it wasn't because of my skills.

258
00:13:56,613 --> 00:14:00,055
It makes me, who's been training
hard, a complete fool!

259
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,182
Don't say things like that!

260
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,186
Promise me!

261
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:10,691
One day either you or me will be the
greatest swordsman in the world!

262
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,402
We will compete to see who does it!

263
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,119
Stupid, saying that even though you are weak...

264
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:22,202
Stupid, saying that even though you are weak...

265
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:27,089
Promise!

266
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,363
Amazing...

267
00:14:38,927 --> 00:14:41,763
Doesn't she seem to be even stronger than before?

268
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:49,396
I must increase my stamina.

269
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,773
Until I can wield as many swords as I want...

270
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,775
If two isn't enough then I'll use three!

271
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:53,984
If two isn't enough then I'll use three!

272
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:54,234
If two isn't enough then I'll use three!

273
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,366
What's the matter with you?

274
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:05,120
Kuina is...

275
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,964
Kuina is dead.

276
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:24,765
She missed her footing on the
stairs in the storage room.

277
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:25,777
Storage room?

278
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:30,562
It seems that she went in there
to find her katana's whetstone.

279
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:31,938
Why look for such a thing...

280
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:32,481
Why look for such a thing...

281
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:33,982
Who knows...

282
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:36,026
She was still a kid.

283
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:36,360
She was still a kid.

284
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,695
You can't understand humans.

285
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,615
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

286
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:16,960
Humans are really fragile beings, Zoro.

287
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,081
Kuina was...

288
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,801
That girl hated to lose.

289
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:28,889
Ever since she was little, she trained in this dojo.

290
00:17:29,723 --> 00:17:32,476
Obtaining skills that would even beat adults.

291
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:36,647
Because of that, she became arrogant...

292
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:39,775
At that time, Zoro...

293
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,194
you appeared before us.

294
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:45,364
I sincerely thank you.

295
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,867
To be able to beat you, who has
become stronger day by day...

296
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:52,120
she concentrated on her training even more.

297
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,666
She didn't want to lose to a boy like you.

298
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:02,881
Thus she started breaking the obstacles
of being a swordswoman...

299
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:07,803
I'm just an ordinary father after all.

300
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,183
Even now when I look at you...

301
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:15,268
I feel a pain in my heart.

302
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:28,812
Sensei...

303
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,912
That katana... please give it to me.

304
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,166
Kuina's katana?

305
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:43,255
I will... take her share of training
and become even stronger!

306
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:46,967
I'll become so strong that my
name will reach the heavens!

307
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,637
I'll become the strongest swordsman in the world!

308
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,437
We promised...

309
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:55,537
I...

310
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:57,237
I...

311
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,637
That's fine!

312
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,203
Kuina's soul and dreams...

313
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:17,497
I leave them to you.

314
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,251
It's been eight years since then...

315
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:06,713
You'll finally go on your journey.

316
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:08,590
Yes, sensei.

317
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,678
To fulfill... my promise.

318
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,470
Zoro!

319
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,646
Take care.

320
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:39,830
I missed.

321
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,623
What are you guys doing?

322
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,375
We re practicing shooting the cannon.

323
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,919
But it's harder than I thought it wouId be.

324
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:46,294
I told you, let me show you how it has to be done.

325
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,255
I told you, let me show you how it has to be done.

326
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,880
I told you, let me show you how it has to be done.

327
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,089
I told you, let me show you how it has to be done.

328
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,257
Eh, with our current distance... this is about right?

329
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:50,465
Eh, with our current distance... this is about right?

330
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:50,674
Eh, with our current distance... this is about right?

331
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:52,843
Eh, with our current distance... this is about right?

332
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:53,260
Eh, with our current distance... this is about right?

333
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,511
Fire!!

334
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:57,848
Amazing!

335
00:20:57,849 --> 00:20:59,474
You hit it with one shot!

336
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:00,726
It reaIIy hit the target.

337
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,188
Of course, when it comes to aiming, I know
everything. So you beIieve now?

338
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:08,150
You're the shooter from now on.

339
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,902
What? I'm not the captain?

340
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,446
I'm the captain!

341
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:13,989
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

342
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:14,072
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

343
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:14,656
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

344
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:14,906
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

345
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:15,032
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

346
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:15,365
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

347
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:16,158
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

348
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:16,700
That's okay, I'll let you have that position for now.

349
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:19,077
However, if you do a poor job,
I'm gonna replace you.

350
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,370
However, if you do a poor job,
I'm gonna replace you.

351
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,246
That's fine.

352
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,873
Before that, I've been thinking.

353
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:23,498
Before that, I've been thinking.

354
00:21:23,498 --> 00:21:23,540
Before that, I've been thinking.

355
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:27,377
Before going to the Grand Line, we
need to filI one more position.

356
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:27,461
Before going to the Grand Line, we
need to fiII one more position.

357
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,088
Right, and we have such a nice kitchen!

358
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:30,297
Right, and we have such a nice kitchen!

359
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:30,505
Right, and we have such a nice kitchen!

360
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,257
If you pay me, I'll do it.

361
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,301
It's an important personnel for any long trip.

362
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:37,095
That's right, it's someone that we
must have on a pirate ship!

363
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:38,472
A musician!

364
00:21:38,972 --> 00:21:40,307
Are you an idiot?

365
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,476
What the hell do you think sailing is?!

366
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,895
I thought you were actually saying
something constructive for once.

367
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,606
But pirates have to sing.

368
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,527
Come out you pirates!

369
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:55,530
What what?!

370
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,199
Who are you?

371
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,201
Shut up!

372
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:01,203
It doesn't matter who I am!

373
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:05,457
How many of them are there?

374
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:08,210
Is there... one?

375
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,836
Then leave it to him

376
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:14,174
I've killed a countless number of pirates.

377
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:18,679
But a no name pirate like you
dares to try kill my partner?!

378
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:20,514
That voice...

379
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,391
What do you mean, partner?

380
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:22,599
I don't know what's going on.

381
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:24,017
I don't know what's going on.

382
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:27,604
But don't damage our ship!

383
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:29,314
No..

384
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,609
No chance at all.

385
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,070
What was that?

386
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,199
Hey you! Aren't you Johnny?

387
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:42,452
Who is it? Calling out my name with no respect.

388
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,124
Zoro-aniki!

389
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,709
So it is Johnny.

390
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,293
Why are you here, aniki?

391
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:51,837
Where's Yosaku? You're not together?

392
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:53,005
What, what?

393
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,424
You two know each other?

1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand streched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,360
Do you see anything, Pell?

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,360
I've checked the roof of every building in the vicinity of the Squre!

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,890
There is no sign of a cannon!

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,050
Then it must be inside one of these buildings!

24
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,860
I will look inside each and every one!

25
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,530
Good!

26
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,610
But I feel no anger towards you.

27
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,270
Do you know why, Nico Robin?

28
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,610
You fool.

29
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,280
I've worked with you for four years!

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,170
I've always known you would do this!

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,060
water!?

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,150
When you're wet, I can cut you with a knife!

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,700
He dodge it! Where...!?

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,660
I forgive you for everything, Nico Robin...

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,960
Because I...

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,730
...have never trusted anyone from the very start!

37
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,830
That's it!

38
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,860
It has to be there!

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,590
SURE-KILLING RED SNAKE STAR!

40
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:07,690
It presses at the time of a nightmare!
It is a Suna Suna team secret base here.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,270
CROCODILE!

42
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,710
WHERE ARE YOU!?

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,690
What's with this place?

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,270
It's falling apart!

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm sure of it!

46
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
The bombers have to be there!

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,820
They can't be anywhere else!

48
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,580
Are you sure they're up there, Vivi!?

49
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,600
If this cloud of sand was part of his plan...

50
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,110
They must be in a place from which they can still aim at the Squre!

51
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,540
And it has to be a space large enough to hold a cannaon which isn't visible from the sky!

52
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,420
Look at this place!

53
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,650
Bigger than you'd think, right?

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,160
Wanna make this place our secret base?

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,430
Yeah!

56
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,350
There's no other place I can think of!

57
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,420
O-Okay, wait!

58
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,860
I'll leave everyone a message for when they get here...

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll go on ahead, Usopp-san!

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,650
Wait, Vivi! Wait!

61
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,500
HURRY!

62
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,790
Right.

63
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,420
We found her!

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,130
We found the Princess!

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,930
And she showed us right where to find her!

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,710
There's still Baroque Works members left...!

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,110
The bad guys followed the signal too!

68
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,700
That's Usopp's signal.

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,840
But what's the Palace doing so far away!?

70
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,260
Yosh! I'm close!

71
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,770
Do you think they found the bombers!?

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,960
They must have!

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,870
Hurry!

74
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,470
USOPP NOISE!

75
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,220
Worthless! You worthless trash!

76
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,020
Okay! Let's go Vivi!

77
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,060
They're getting away!

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,780
Get back here!

79
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,430
It took me so long to get here.

80
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,360
But, it's finally time!

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,470
Time to end it all!

82
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,130
This land is MINE!

83
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,110
You!

84
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,490
You're trapped, Croc!

85
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,160
Why are you alive?

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,570
Why do you stand up to me every time I kill you!?

87
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,030
WELL, STRAW HAT!?

88
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,650
Why did he come here?

89
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,510
He would have survived...

90
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,740
Who... is he?

91
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,690
Straw Hat...

92
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,810
How many times do I have to kill you until you're satisfied!?

93
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,470
You haven't returned it...

94
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,360
What you stole.

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,950
What I stole?

96
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,370
Money?

97
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,330
Fame?

98
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,050
Trust?

99
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,140
Life?

100
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,960
RAIN!?

101
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,340
What do you want me to return?

102
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,120
I've stolen more than I can count!

103
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,580
The country.

104
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,880
The country?

105
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,140
That's a funny thing to say.

106
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,900
I am just about to take this country!

107
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,960
I will become King of this land and rule it!

108
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,760
When we came to this island...

109
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,130
...it was already gone.

110
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,470
This country wasn't hers!

111
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,100
I have to dissuade the Rebel Army.

112
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,350
I don't want any more blood to be spilled.

113
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,380
Unit recently, this was a lively, green town.

114
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,700
I beg of you, Vivi-chan.

115
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,970
Please stop those fools!

116
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,350
If this was really her country...

117
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,210
What's wrong with not wanting anyone to die?

118
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,980
From looking at this country, what needs to done most...

119
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,460
...is even clear... to me!

120
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,010
You think risking your one life is going to be enough!?

121
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,360
What am I-!

122
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,950
I have nothing else to risk...

123
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,080
Try risking our lives along with yours!

124
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,360
WE'RE YOUR NAKAMA!

125
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,590
If this was really her country...

126
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,770
...she'd be able to smile more!

127
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,850
After that impressive speech,

128
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,540
What do you expect to do without any water?

129
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,210
Impossible!

130
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,570
How did he kick me without using water!?

131
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,230
If you had never set foot in my country...

132
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,130
...Arabasta would have been at peace!

133
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,790
Doesn't it moves you to tears?

134
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,610
The love for the country is what will destroy the country.

135
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,380
Crocodile!

136
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,070
Wa-!

137
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,750
Bastard...

138
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,330
Was that...

139
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,510
...your blood?

140
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,940
Blood hardens sand too, right?

141
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,940
Rainbase...

142
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,360
The Royal Palace...

143
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,010
And now in this undergound chamer.

144
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,010
You've seen Hell twice and still come back to challenge me.

145
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,830
I will repay your tenacity...

146
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,390
Damn you...!

147
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,030
...as a pirate!

148
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,460
It seems no matter what I do, you'll keep trying to defeat me.

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,010
I think it's time I treated you properly as the nuisance you are.

150
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
He took it off...

151
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,470
What is that?

152
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,590
A poison hook.

153
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,830
Oh.

154
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,950
As you are a pirate like any other...

155
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,150
I expect you to know this well.

156
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,370
A duel between pirates is a battle to the death.

157
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,670
There is no such word as "unfair"!

158
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,550
When the explosion happens in the Square above us, this place will be destroyed with it!

159
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,490
This is the end.

160
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,310
We'll decide the victor once and for all!

161
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,930
That way! That's where the smoke was coming from!

162
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,170
Or, was it this way?

163
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,220
What? Marines!

164
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,200
Look! It's Roronoa Zoro!

165
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,860
Dammit.

166
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,090
The Marines followed us all way to this city.

167
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,780
I don't have time for this!

168
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,070
No choice, I'll finish this in three seconds.

169
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,340
Idiot, how did you get all the way out here!?

170
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,020
What do you think you're doing!?

171
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,240
That's what I should be asking you!

172
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,120
Roronoa Zoro!

173
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,910
We were informed that you had no sense of direction,

174
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,400
But this is just ridiculous!

175
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,810
Turn back!

176
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,460
Go back to the last corner and head north!

177
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,570
That's take you to the Square!

178
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,860
Go back and take a right. This is the wrong way.

179
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,160
Are you stupid or something!?

180
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,200
Stupid?

181
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,180
Hurry!

182
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,680
Go!

183
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,140
W-What?

184
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,490
What's going on!?

185
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,350
Run! Keep running, Vivi!

186
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,550
Usopp-san, I can't...!

187
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,820
T-Th-Thank...

188
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,650
We'll cover you!

189
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,120
Please stop the bombing!

190
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,440
Now, hurry!

191
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,660
Thank you.

192
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,090
Hurry, Usopp-san!

193
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,100
Right!

194
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,220
All unit, secure the area around them and lead support whenever it's needed!

195
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,840
Aye!

196
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,970
You're ordering me to Alubarna?

197
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,650
Should I pursue the Straw Hat Pirates?

198
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,430
Or...

199
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,510
Decide what to do when you get there.

200
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,440
Just follow your own sense of justice.

201
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,590
Whatever happens, I'll take responsibility.

202
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,890
Hurry... HURRY!

203
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,190
We've lost so much time!

204
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,030
I don't understand what's going on, but...

205
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,890
...the Marines just saved us!

206
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,830
We really have to hand it to them!

207
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,600
Dummy, stay focused!

208
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,910
There's gonna be more victims than that if we don't stop the bomb!

209
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,040
Right...

210
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,560
Praying won't stop this explosion!

211
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,460
In two minutes...

212
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,260
We'll either be corpses...

213
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,560
...or heroes!

214
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,160
RIGHT!

215
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,190
EVERYONE TOGETHER!

216
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:14,960
RIGHT!

217
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,840
There they are!

218
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,120
Vivi, Usopp!

219
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,810
Nami-san! Tony-kun!

220
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,850
What's going on?

221
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,700
The Marines helped us find you!

222
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,350
Did you find the bombers?

223
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,690
We haven't confirmed it yet, but I know I'm right!

224
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,000
We've been looking at it the whole time,

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,100
But it was obscured from us!

226
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,080
The bombers must be in there!

227
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,190
The clock tower...

228
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,290
I get it!

229
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,960
It would be easy to aim at the Squre from up there!

230
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,360
If only Pell were here, he could stop the bombing.

231
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,820
Pell...

232
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,190
There is no time left!

233
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,310
I know the smoke came from around here, but...

234
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
Gero - sound a frog makes

235
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
Gero,gero,gero,gero!

236
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
Hey, listen!

237
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,680
I just shot down a really huge bird with my Gero Gero Gun!

238
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,120
I have failed...!

239
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,320
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

240
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,620
Just who is this man?

241
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:02,110
The Kingdom's greatest warriors were like ants before Crocodile, and yet...

242
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,120
Impaled...

243
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,410
Buried alive...

244
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,130
Dried out...

245
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,450
You may have been able to come back from all that...

246
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,360
But you won't stand again after this one.

247
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,850
The fight is over.

248
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,600
The poison is already spreading through your body.

249
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,300
You don't understand anything!

250
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,930
What happened to him?

251
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,070
I don't see Pell...

252
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,080
Hey, Vivi.

253
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,310
Even if we know where it is, there's no way we can get up there in a minute!

254
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,740
Pell, where are you? Hurry!

255
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,910
We're just going to have to try ourselves!

256
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,160
The stairs are our only choice!

257
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,930
The entrance...

258
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,000
Oi!

259
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,070
Nami-swan! Vivi-chwan!

260
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,600
WHY ARE YOU UP THERE!?

261
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,800
Why!?

262
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,560
Because you left a freakin' message for me!

263
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,200
It said "Clock Tower", so I started making my way up.

264
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,990
What do you want me to do?

265
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,220
Where're the bombers?

266
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,570
They're at the top! The top!

267
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,890
Get up to the top and kick their asses!

268
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,150
Yo! I've been looking for you guys!

269
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,090
ZORO! YOU'RE HERE TOO!?

270
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,900
What are you guys doing all the way over there?

271
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,980
That's what I want to know!

272
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,180
I dunno!

273
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,240
The Marines kept saying "Go north! Go north!"...

274
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,980
So I went up this building!

275
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,160
"NORTH" AND "UP" ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!

276
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,990
Anyway, good for both of you!

277
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,480
Just keep climbing and beat up whoever's going to fire the cannon!

278
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,080
They can't!

279
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,900
WHAT!?

280
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,420
They can't get into the tower from where they are.

281
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,850
Other than entering from the sky, the only way...

282
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,420
...to enter the tower is via the staircase on the first floor!

283
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,320
But... what if we had Zoro break through a wall and...

284
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,320
The bomb might not be able to withstand the shock of walls being broken!

285
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,600
As we thought, the stairs are the only way...

286
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,810
Wait, Vivi.

287
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,780
I just had an idea!

288
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,490
Gero,gero,gero,gero~!

289
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,330
Hey, listen, Mr.7!

290
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,400
You know what?

291
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,300
This is our final order!

292
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,170
Gero,gero,gero~!

293
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,990
That's about the size of it!

294
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,390
I'd size it as being about 30 seconds from now!

295
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,840
Who are they?

296
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,340
Mr.7!

297
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,500
Miss Fathersday!

298
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

299
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

300
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

301
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,290
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

302
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,210
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

303
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,470
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

304
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,890
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

305
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,150
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

306
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,360
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

307
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

308
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,080
Let's paint a story of the future

309
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,330
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

310
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

311
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

312
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,550
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

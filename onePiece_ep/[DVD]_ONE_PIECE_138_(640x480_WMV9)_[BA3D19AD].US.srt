1
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,530
It is…

2
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,260
A trap! The Navy their tightened a trap!

3
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
The guy!

4
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,550
Usopp!

5
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,940
Ahead!

6
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,710
What?!

7
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,120
Does a boat pirate which goes down from the mountain?

8
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,230
Ossan!

9
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,190
Where the treasure of the island is!

10
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,190
Pirates of Zenny, With the attack!

11
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,150
It is him.

12
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,810
Played well, Ossan!

13
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,710
Oi, Oi, do not exaggerate.

14
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,570
Its heart probably stopped from now on.

15
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,810
Hey, how can you say a similar thing?

16
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,720
Jii-san! Is all well?

17
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,450
I finally left at sea.

18
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,670
I really became a pirate!

19
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,900
It is that! It is not my coffin!

20
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,710
It is an authentic pirate boat, Zenny!

21
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,730
It is not true?

22
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,320
It is that, Ossan!

23
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,000
Does not encourage it!

24
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,490
It is sick!

25
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,840
What is it that, Zenny the praetor on pledges?

26
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,890
It is not your work to take the money of these pirates?

27
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,550
I stopped being a praetor on pledges years ago.

28
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,960
Now I am Zenny the Pirate!

29
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,100
Do not laugh in front of the Navy, species of insane old man!

30
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,740
Jii-san, made attention!

31
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,420
It has some after your treasure!

32
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,210
Oh? Thus now instead of catching pirates,

33
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,260
Was the Navy put at hunting for the part-time treasures?

34
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,280
What assiduous men!

35
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,880
Nami, brings back the boat.

36
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,120
Of agreement! That everyone follows me.

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,600
Species of bastard! Do not give orders to Nami-san!

38
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,240
Minche sergeant! The crew of the straw hat prepares to do something!

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,210
Call the fleet of the Moore Captain in reinforcement!

40
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,940
Your mouth!

41
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,800
Didn't I say you that I was going to give you a share of the treasure?

42
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,350
You, isn't this includes/understands?

43
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,340
The Captain should not know about what occurs here.

44
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,340
Let us see seeing.

45
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,900
Thus for a part-time work, you would kill your subordinate.

46
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,350
You must be done full of money, Mister the Sergeant.

47
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,470
Species of old waste.

48
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,690
Do not believe that you will leave yourself there alive!

49
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,440
Your mouth, kid!

50
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,910
You have base to try to steal the treasure of a pirate!

51
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,090
Take it if you can!

52
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,100
Quite known as, Ossan!

53
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,290
Show him how the pirates fight!

54
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,760
Yosh!

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,380
IDIOT!

56
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,000
It was what the goal of that?

57
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,220
Bastard…

58
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,960
If you are a pirate, in this case that will not be done anything to be killed by the Navy!

59
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,250
Does Hey, this old man have weapons?

60
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,730
I of insane who you are Navy!

61
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,020
I will show you competences of a counting frame 10th daN!

62
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,480
With the attack!

63
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,460
A counting frame and…

64
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,570
… goats!

65
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,560
What?! It has problems!

66
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,300
Ossan!

67
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,690
What a stunned!

68
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,650
Luffy!

69
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,660
Bandage cretins! What did you aim?

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,990
You should not waste your ammunition!

71
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,250
I am just there! And here me is!

72
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,200
What you make?!

73
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,130
They are goats! GOATS!

74
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,970
We have a problem because precisely they are goats, Sergent.

75
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,810
Hey! The combat already started!

76
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,770
Why not descend and take a little pleasure?

77
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,180
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

78
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,610
I know. Move just a little.

79
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,280
Calm you, Chopper!

80
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,310
But…

81
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,820
Jii-san is not in good condition for this type of things!

82
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,400
Fire!

83
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,400
Do not draw!

84
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,220
As soon as my guy are irritated, one cannot any more stop them!

85
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,560
With the attack!

86
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,350
Oi, Oi, look at them!

87
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,520
They were put in position!
They are only awaiting us!

88
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Odd… They do not seem to move.

89
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,850
We must think of a plan as long as we still can it.

90
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,080
Good, what does one make?

91
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,100
Do we have to attack in first?

92
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,290
That is to say not insane!

93
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,790
We must go to help Jii-san immediately!

94
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,060
Does Hey, one have not just run up against something against the moment?

95
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,180
Good Ah?

96
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,980
You dispatch!

97
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,270
Moore captain! There is no answer on behalf of the boat of the Minche Sergeant.

98
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,770
Which was this shot?

99
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,370
Do we have to advance?

100
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,940
Not, not yet.

101
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,440
Await the report/ratio of Minche.

102
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,590
Where are you all gone?

103
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,490
Bandage vermins! I have enough you of it!

104
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,930
It is enough!

105
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,980
Yosha!

106
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,120
What did it arrive at your bravery, Zenny the Pirate?

107
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,940
Lacks breath?

108
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,840
Thus you are finally descended, species of hooligan.

109
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,250
What a large mouth!

110
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,930
Why one would not finish any immediately.

111
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,050
Where is the treasure, Zenny the Pirate?

112
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,350
What did you say, Caporal-chef?

113
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,660
Why didn't you finish yet of it?

114
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,550
Yes!

115
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,350
I am terribly sorry, Capitaine Moore.

116
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,610
This small dumb.

117
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,070
He thus had some after that.

118
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,950
Why cowards you not the piece?

119
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,720
You do not want to die immediately, not?

120
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,200
Of course that I want to live.

121
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,280
I really want it.

122
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,350
But I said it to you. I do not have a round.

123
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,200
What am I to suppose to release?

124
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,960
I am too poor to spit.

125
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,690
Well.

126
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,750
In any event, the island is rather small.

127
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,420
Ca will not take much time to turn over each centimetre of ground.

128
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
You are not to me any more any utility now.

129
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,220
Species of small…

130
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,030
It is the end!

131
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,170
I broke your counting frame.

132
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,350
Afflicted.

133
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,140
What you insane brothel?!

134
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,470
Do you think that you can flee easily after being gone against the Navy?!

135
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,350
Jii-san!

136
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,760
You are late the guy!

137
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,280
I was about to die!

138
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,650
We were so anxious on your subject.

139
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,520
KE \ko72}SHI

140
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,350
[Note:Star of smoke]

141
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,800
Ca will be enough amply.

142
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,850
Was Robin, you there?

143
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,220
You do not worry Jii-san!
Capitaine Usopp is there!

144
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,610
What occurred? You have a large bump!

145
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,520
He does not have pulse!

146
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,100
Calm you, Chopper.

147
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,500
It is by here.

148
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,610
I know!

149
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,680
You put at ease! You sleep!

150
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,470
Will not die, Jii-san!

151
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I am not dying.

152
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,560
How do you feel, Jii-san?

153
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,520
I feel very well.

154
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,820
I finally became a pirate.

155
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,760
I feel more alive than ever.

156
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,960
We came on this island only because the Sergeant had given the order of it.

157
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,710
I see. I suppose that the subordinates must obey the orders.

158
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,040
Our Captain is also very egoistic.

159
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,570
Really?

160
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,990
You are not supposed to make you friends.

161
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Oi, Ossan. You are well?

162
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,850
Are YOU well?

163
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,310
Frankly Luffy, you are really useless!

164
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,640
The attacks grew blurred. You should be well for the moment.

165
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,860
Thank you, Dr. Chopper.

166
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,050
Afflicted.

167
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,120
Ossan. It was advantageous?

168
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,500
Not too badly.

169
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,360
Now…

170
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,970
Then Ojii-chan, can you speak to us now about the treasure?

171
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,110
Hey! Do not make start my patient!

172
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,680
Jii-san, hold good!

173
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,200
I think that you had me.

174
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,380
Well.

175
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,800
You all enormously helped me.

176
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,020
I suppose that I can speak to you about it.

177
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,970
It is what I wanted to hear!

178
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,700
Ca must be really a very large treasure so even the Navy know it.

179
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,200
I had a treasure.

180
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,920
I had a mountain of treasures which I had taken to the pirates of compensation.

181
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,910
Then I thought that it was time to repurchase my pirate boat and to start to gather a complete crew.

182
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,860
Thus, I changed it into argent liquide.

183
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,580
Argent liquide!

184
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,040
While reconsidering there, I suppose that to flee with was my destiny.

185
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,040
Last night, I said to you how I had failed on this island…

186
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,400
… after having escaped with some pirates to which I had recovered the money, isn't this?

187
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,590
Of course, I took the money with me.

188
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,350
This money was for my dream and I risked my life to reach it.

189
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,080
But when I awoke after being swept on the beach…

190
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,220
They ate it?!

191
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,070
Really?

192
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,810
All?! All money?!

193
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,740
Ouais.

194
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,010
Some tickets have being saved.

195
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,000
It is for that which I say that they represent my treasure.

196
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,980
My fortune flew away, but now I have a crew.

197
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,900
They will never disappoint me nor will not put a stab in the back to me.

198
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,950
They help me without never thinking of the profit, and they will be always with my with dimensions.

199
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,030
I would like to return the similar one in kindness to them.

200
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,830
I now have the most beautiful treasure of the world.

201
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,510
It is brilliant, Ossan!

202
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,260
Ouais, it is brilliant.

203
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,320
Even when I stumble, I am never raised the empty handeds.

204
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,610
Rubbish!

205
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,940
Hey, Straw hat!

206
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,050
This combat is not finished yet!

207
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,750
An unscathed fleet waits just there low!

208
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,750
You will not flee easily!

209
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,130
Is not so proud whereas you from go away while rolling.

210
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,330
Is he cretin?

211
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,470
It is you the cretins!

212
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,720
Do you think of having a small chance against a fleet of nine boats?

213
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,860
I will not flee.

214
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,680
Will say to them that they come, if they want to fight!

215
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,630
GOMU GOMU NO!

216
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,640
Hey Luffy, aims at very small little higher.

217
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,660
Of agreement!

218
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,430
GUN!

219
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,430
Straight towards the target.

220
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,680
You…

221
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,320
You are the shame of the Navy!

222
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,800
Take it along!

223
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,900
Well!

224
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,040
I am the Moore Captain of the Navy.

225
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,390
I do not may find it beneficial any to capture this man, Zenny, which lives on this island.

226
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,410
My only goal is to catch you, in the name of justice.

227
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,400
However, to thank you for having given to us the vermin of our body,

228
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,480
I will let to you decide place of battle.

229
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,170
Now, put the veils!

230
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,710
We were precisely thinking of leaving.

231
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,440
We will go soon towards you.

232
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,000
And here is, Jii-san. I repaired that for you.

233
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,400
Thank you very much.

234
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,330
You do not worry for that.

235
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,170
I prepared your meal.

236
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,670
All that it remains you to do, it is to cook it.

237
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,120
Ah. Thank you.

238
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,530
But you them will guy, that go?

239
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,370
You nine boats, isn't this will fight?

240
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,200
You do not worry for us.

241
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,930
I am not only strong. I am also very lucky.

242
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,450
I suppose that I am not size against you, Nii-chan.

243
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,980
Jii-san, I have make a large package of drugs.

244
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,640
Do not forget to take them.

245
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,100
Do not forget!

246
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,310
Well, well.

247
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,140
I will take them, do not worry you.

248
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,760
It was amusing, Ojii-chan.

249
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,940
Take care of you!

250
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
Hey the guy! Take care of the old man!

251
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,280
With later on the seas!

252
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,550
Ouais!

253
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,990
I take the sea as soon as I repair the boat!

254
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,500
We will await you, the Pirates of Zenny!

255
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,750
Ok, let us turn over on the island.

256
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,910
We need to repair the boat.

257
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,450
Well, everyone. Go down, we return to the house.

258
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,350
If I want to be a pirate, that does not disturb the age which I have, not?

259
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,490
They really know how to excite an old man.

260
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,730
And this Chopper works really hard.

261
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,970
How much years that T it will take to me to finish these drugs?

262
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,760
Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.

263
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,320
I think that I could be able to live a little longer.

264
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,270
I want to say, my life of pirate have just started.

265
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,120
Us to take along in the corner of the rocks covered by the fog?

266
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,510
It is an good idea, Luffy.

267
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,630
You your brain occasionally, isn't this uses?

268
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,620
Really?

269
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,620
“Really?” I ask you!

270
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,140
It is the fleet of Moore!

271
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,970
Any boat of the Navy, answer!

272
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,370
It is the fleet of Moore!

273
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,250
Ask an immediate assistance!

274
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,550
What a idiotic!

275
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,310
I am afflicted, I made you a compliment! Return it to me!

276
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,790
To return what?

277
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,900
It is impossible that it planned as much.

278
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,400
It was right chance, it is that?

279
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,050
It just showed any direction.

280
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,740
Moreover, Mr. Doctor.

281
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,970
Without lying, that do you think of the condition of the old man?

282
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,930
These drugs can only anticipate the attacks.

283
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,240
They will not look after its disease.

284
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,100
First of all, its heart is weak, and it is rather old.

285
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,080
It should not travel on board a boat, nor to become a pirate alone.

286
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,490
About what you do speak?

287
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,620
If Ossan wants to become a pirate, us should let it make.

288
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,260
And if it goes at sea,

289
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,330
It will be able to perhaps find a remedy for its disease.

290
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,990
You think?

291
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,820
Of made you not as much.

292
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,090
This old man will not die so easily.

293
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,650
Even by knowing that it is weak, it is rather energetic.

294
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,470
It is true, Chopper.

295
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
We will still re-examine it.

296
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,690
Yes, it is true.

297
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,750
We will wait!

298
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,020
Pirates of Zenny!

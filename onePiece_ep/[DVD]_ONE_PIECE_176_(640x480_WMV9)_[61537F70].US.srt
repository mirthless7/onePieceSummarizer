1
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,480
Ground of God, Upper Yard.

2
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,940
The nightmare of made Survival
always rage on the territory.

3
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,850
Nico Robin reaches finally
Shandora, the City of Gold…

4
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,710
while Chopper faces the Priest
Ohm in the higher ruins.

5
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,100
Unfortunately, it is overcome.

6
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,160
It is possible no to survive
with the Truth of the Pain.

7
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,599
The chance of survival is of 0%.

8
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,120
Ordalie of Iron!

9
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,630
Where is the exit?!

10
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
Now, in the ruins
in top of Giant Jack,

11
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,000
four survivors are on
the point to start the combat.

12
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,020
Old ruins would be said.

13
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,780
He well, it one is crowned band
the hard ones to cook that we have there.

14
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,879
He, pass to me gold!

15
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,179
He well, which sadness.

16
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,910
None among you will escape
in my Ordalie of Iron.

17
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,010
If one of you is put in
through my road, I kill it!

18
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,220
You will say to me where
find Eneru and my holy guard.

19
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,940
It is what this connery of cave?!

20
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,460
He well, gentlemen, you seem all to have to make, but to achieve your goal,

21
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,560
you will have initially to survive!

22
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:04,010
Climb Giant Jack!!
Confrontation in the higher ruins

23
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,590
Despite everything, moment that
God had predicted approach.

24
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,510
None you will survive.

25
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,890
Predicted?

26
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,700
If you had not answered your desires, your lives would have been longer.

27
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,890
Your wounds will make you
to include/understand the gravity of your crime.

28
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,130
I suppose that you are one of
these Priests with the service of God.

29
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,400
I insane steps badly of
what God could predict.

30
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,400
I soon will find gold.
I do not have anything to make with you.

31
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,250
This also is not authorized.

32
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,820
To perish under my Ordalie of Iron is
the only exit which you will reach.

33
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,380
I will save you.

34
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,740
Nothing more than of stupid chatterings.

35
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,569
Allons-y, Holy.

36
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,620
Make them what it you will like.

37
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,409
It is our target, Pierre!

38
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,940
The Priests of Eneru must be
destroyed before continuing!

39
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,570
This foutu python followed me
all length up to now.

40
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,770
Whore.

41
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,740
It is unbreakable, but
that rises and that turns.

42
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,820
This cave is odd!

43
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,610
Each one of you…

44
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,260
is dedicated to die!

45
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,159
This dangerous weapon me with the air.

46
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,870
Ignoramus of inhabitant of the Blue Sea!

47
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,919
You and your crew, do not be
arrived at the sky that yesterday.

48
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,640
You do not have the right of
to take anything!

49
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,630
I have my snap of it to hear you
to repeat what one can do or not.

50
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,130
What occurs in
sky does not concern us!

51
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,170
I am well of agreement!

52
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,110
I should have completed you as of the beginning!

53
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,689
You are nothing more than one parasite!

54
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,820
Burst!

55
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,430
This guy is stronger than I thought it.

56
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,010
BURST!

57
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,870
It is true. This thing has
hooks filled with venom.

58
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,640
And now, of the hooks behind?!

59
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,760
How a dog can it
to move like that?!

60
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,080
It is called Holy.

61
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,290
I inform you that I draw up the animals
sky. I am the Celestial Stockbreeder.

62
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,069
When they are animals, I them
teach much more than the discipline.

63
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,070
I learned how to him to be held on two legs and I made of him a true boxer!

64
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,540
And there you will be able to taste!

65
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,260
Do not do of it a little too much to you?

66
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,800
Gan Fall…

67
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,580
In spite of your defeat against Shura,
you still did not include/understand?

68
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,810
I believe that it is time that stop you
to make toy with your lance, old wreck!

69
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,319
I will not release taken!

70
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,920
I must discover what
you manigancez, imbeciles!

71
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,140
Would not be so haughty and arrogant!

72
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,779
Even if you discovered it,

73
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,250
A type in your kind would not include/understand
nothing for God!

74
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,560
Follow them, follow them
! Catch up with Shandia!

75
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,019
What, what?

76
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,119
It is what these “meh” which I hear?

77
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,069
Goats?

78
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,339
They are the Soldiers!

79
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,169
One will die if they catch us!

80
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,129
What? Soldiers?

81
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,380
Troops of Eneru!
It is necessary to leave from here!

82
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,829
Wait a little! I announce you that…

83
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,710
One does not even know where one goes!

84
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,330
It is what?

85
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,489
Giant Jack!

86
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,159
The Sanctuary of Eneru
is perhaps up there!

87
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,630
The Sanctuary of Eneru?

88
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,009
Wiper!

89
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,879
What?

90
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,769
Wiper is up there!

91
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,520
It is alive!

92
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,110
They approach Giant Jack!

93
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,070
Do not let them reach
the Sanctuary of God!

94
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,910
Leave us quiet!

95
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,930
This whore of snake.
It does not release the business!

96
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,209
He… Chopper!

97
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,760
He! How it occurred?!

98
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,090
I see. His/her companion of the Blue Sea.

99
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,530
He, looks at where you go.

100
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,580
It was what?

101
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,730
Barbed wire?

102
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,510
It is its Ordalie?

103
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,239
Chopper!

104
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,589
He, Chopper!

105
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,269
Answer me!

106
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,929
Why you came here all alone?!

107
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,439
He!

108
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,430
Which damage.

109
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,320
They are Iron Clouds.

110
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,690
Light like clouds,
but hard like iron.

111
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,659
They can spout out of Milky Dial.

112
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,519
I installed of them several in
corner, each one with its own detonator.

113
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,320
If you steps on one
they, Dial will start.

114
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,239
In this zone, you do not know
sites of the switches.

115
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,140
I do not even need to attack you.

116
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,230
Half of what arrived
to this animal comes from me.

117
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,570
The remainder, it is him even which
started in Ordalie.

118
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,180
You wish to avenge it?

119
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,520
Not, I do not like too me
to beat for such a reason.

120
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,860
Oh? Your answer impresses me.

121
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,170
But…

122
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
I am just a little out of me.

123
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,800
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

124
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,300
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

125
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,540
I am sorry. This is
good place, Conis-san?

126
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,969
This is the coast where they
are given go?

127
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,610
Yes, Father. It is what Nami-san said.

128
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,369
But the situation is
rather embarrassing.

129
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,320
We must keep
their boat, now.

130
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,130
We must make our possible
to defend it until their return.

131
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,539
Must I make sound the trumpet
to make flee the danger?

132
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,439
Very good idea, Father!

133
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,280
Ca will give us courage!

134
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,670
It is perfect.

135
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,590
Suu, can you make
the guet by over there?

136
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,560
Nami-san, which kind of promise?

137
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,989
It is right so that all occurs well.

138
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,189
Luffy and others
went in the forest.

139
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,429
We agreed for
us to find on the east coast, then…

140
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,030
it is over there that we go.

141
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,739
I wonder whether they are left there.

142
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,060
The forest is so dangerous.

143
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,139
I hope that they are
all healthy and safe.

144
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,430
They are well!

145
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,980
They belong to our
crew. They will be left there.

146
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,739
Go!

147
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,009
I will look after them costs whom costs!

148
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,980
Hold good, you two!

149
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,519
I hope that everyone is well.

150
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,740
I consider it regrettable that the island
celestial is thus.

151
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,370
All with the Sanctuary of God!

152
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,080
We have a chance of
to take the head of Eneru!

153
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,040
We will not leave you
to reach the Sanctuary of God!

154
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,159
It is Giant Jack!

155
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,340
Climb it!

156
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,210
I you beg Wiper of it,
do not use any more Reject!

157
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,210
Soldiers, you gather! Us
let us must stop Shandia!

158
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,490
Wiper, you should not defy Eneru!

159
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,830
Eneru…

160
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,990
No matter what one does, one
cannot overcome Eneru!

161
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,330
It is well.

162
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,780
You all, thus climb
with the higher ruins.

163
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,100
Over there, you will fight to survive.

164
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,040
There will remain only 5 about it.

165
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,820
The words of God are irrefutable.

166
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,120
Stop, Wiper! I am…

167
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,070
You are what? You want to make me believe
how you are not our enemy?!

168
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,310
Eneru and you, you are
similar in our eyes, Gan Fall!

169
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,230
Es you unable to hear reason?!

170
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,710
Be made foutre!

171
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,039
Burn Bazooka did not kill it?!

172
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,590
Of what its scales are made?!

173
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,930
Ca is enough! Ca is enough, stupid cave!

174
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,689
It is my chance.

175
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,430
The more it moves, the more
it leaves openings.

176
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,570
It was what?

177
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
It is characteristic of people of
Blue sea. You did not expect it.

178
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,090
This sword is too
made Iron Cloud.

179
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,090
In other words, this blade…

180
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,740
is in fact an expelled Iron Cloud
by Dial embedded in the handle.

181
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,040
It tracks my preys,
where how they are!

182
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,120
You include/understand now,
epeist of the Blue Sea?

183
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
It is a kind of whip. I included/understood.

184
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,980
You, epeists of the White Sea,
be only one band of acrobats.

185
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,780
Holy.

186
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,380
We will fight separately.

187
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,580
The higher ruins… go
soon to suffer some damage.

188
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,559
My faith.

189
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,839
Even if the Master of the Skies is here.

190
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,550
We will fight with you, Ohm-sama!

191
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,440
The guy…

192
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,479
It would seem that apart from us…

193
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,279
Ouais, he remains only us.

194
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,010
We will help you with
to reach Eneru, Wiper!

195
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,630
I know! I will dig
to leave from here!

196
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,940
The python…

197
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,420
It enough!

198
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,540
Stop!

199
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,310
Leave us quiet!

200
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,169
Nami!

201
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,009
Aisa!

202
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,339
Young girl!

203
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,240
Stop them!

204
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,470
Aisa, what you insane there?!

205
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,020
Nami, why you are assembled?!

206
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,219
Are Zoro, where the different ones?

207
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,359
Wiper!

208
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,180
What you plot,
inhabitants of the Blue Sea?!

209
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,130
Aisa, deviates from it!

210
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,359
One is saved.

211
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,760
Demon! Wiper, species of demon!

212
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,789
Girls, why
did you come up to now?

213
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,589
Why?!

214
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,530
Because there was this gigantic…

215
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,390
… snake…

216
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,360
What a cretin!

217
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,480
Aisa!

218
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,710
Wiper!

219
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,360
You were distracted and have
lowered your guard. Idiots.

220
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,590
Forget the others!

221
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,600
There is nothing any more with
to make to save them.

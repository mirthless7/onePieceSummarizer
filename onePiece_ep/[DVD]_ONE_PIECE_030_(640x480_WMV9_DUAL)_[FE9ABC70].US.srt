1
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:52,302
GOMU GOMU NO...

2
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:53,929
GOMU GOMU NO...

3
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:57,265
BAZOOKA!!!

4
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:58,475
BAZOOKA!!!

5
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,189
No problem, 'coz my hands and feet are still free!

6
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:07,285
What!?

7
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:08,785
This time...

8
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:10,485
It's all over!

9
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,708
You still can't do anything about that kid's 'spear'.

10
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,082
I know a fool,

11
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:30,382
Who got attached to that 'spear'
for his own stupid reasons.

12
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,185
All Blue!

13
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,649
I'm the strongest!

14
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:47,816
I'm the strongest!

15
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:51,278
Don Krieg...

16
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:52,178
Don Krieg...

17
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,906
We've lost.

18
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:56,408
Commander!

19
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,496
Thanks for everything, Sanji-san.

20
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:05,876
Give him this message for me when he gets up...

21
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:11,465
I may only have a few hours left in me.

22
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:15,343
It's kinda weird for me declaring this,
just because I'm running out of time,

23
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,888
but this time, I'm going to do what I want to do.

24
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:18,930
Trusting my instincts.

25
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:21,558
Then I won't have anywhere to run anymore.

26
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:26,271
When your mind's made up, you eventually
pay less attention to things like,

27
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:29,357
Being scared of a strong enemy,
or how not to hurt yourself.

28
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,693
That's what he taught me.

29
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,474
See ya.

30
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:36,698
I'll be taking this.

31
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,534
I don't have to return it, do I?

32
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:40,243
Nope.

33
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:44,790
Try if you dare, small fry.

34
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:45,457
Hey! Drive this into your head!

35
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:48,168
Hey! Drive this into your head!

36
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:51,922
This is the fighting sea restaurant, Baratie!

37
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,008
A strange restaurant indeed...

38
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:07,437
DEPARTURE!
SEA CHEF AND LUFFY TRAVEL TOGETHER

39
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:07,562
DEPARTURE!
SEA CHEF AND LUFFY TRAVEL TOGETHER

40
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:24,246
Ah! My hat?!

41
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,206
Where's my straw hat?!

42
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,457
Isn't it right there?

43
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:29,042
Oh yeah.

44
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,210
Feel all better now?

45
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:32,629
Eh? Where'd they go?

46
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:34,105
They're gone.

47
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:35,815
Thanks to you.

48
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:36,466
Me?

49
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,345
''We might meet again at the Grand
Line,'' was what Gin said.

50
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:43,140
Gin, eh?

51
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,066
He told you that?

52
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:46,226
He meant you!

53
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:50,439
Oh yeah!

54
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:52,566
Since I kicked 'em out,

55
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,526
guess I'm off the hook with all the work here?

56
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:55,652
Congratulations.

57
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:57,404
But, about you...

58
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:58,530
I'm not going.

59
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:00,490
I don't want to be a pirate.

60
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,885
I'm staying here to continue being a cook,

61
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,596
until that old fart acknowledges my cooking skills.

62
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:09,291
I see.. I'll give up then.

63
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,668
Your hand isn't giving up!!

64
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:17,340
I can't go.

65
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,927
They're all unreliable around here.

66
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,889
But I'll go there someday.

67
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:25,932
...Grand Line.

68
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,245
Then, let's go now!

69
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,481
Not now.

70
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,151
Hey!

71
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:39,488
Have you ever heard of ''All Blue''?

72
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:40,297
Nope.

73
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,716
What? You haven't?!

74
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,651
It's a mystical sea!

75
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,596
In that sea,

76
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:54,086
fish from all over - East Blue, West Blue, North
Blue and South Blue, can all be found there!

77
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:59,082
It's like a wonderland for cooks like us!

78
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:01,424
And it's in the Grand Line!

79
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:02,836
So, have you heard of it?

80
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:09,768
He looks so damn happy.

81
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:12,729
Fool.

82
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:21,029
Lunch time, boys!

83
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:25,033
Finally, some grub!

84
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:26,493
Food, food, food!

85
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,960
Hey, where are we sitting?

86
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,919
Where's the food?

87
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,632
We didn't save a seat for you.

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,135
Eat on the floor, the floor.

89
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:44,553
No seat?

90
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,096
How can that be?

91
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,198
This is a restaurant for crying out loud!

92
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:50,976
Oh well...

93
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,395
They're acting weird.

94
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:56,940
It's what they always do.

95
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:01,987
Hey!! Who in the world made the soup this morning?

96
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:03,864
It's me! Me!

97
00:07:03,947 --> 00:07:04,656
Pretty good, eh?

98
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,867
Today's is even more exceptional.

99
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,369
I could hardly swallow this piece of crap!

100
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:10,720
It's only fit for pigs!

101
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:23,508
Hey. You never tasted 'human'
food before, crappy cook?

102
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,012
You're turning this awful cooking into an art form.

103
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,263
I'm about to puke!

104
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,809
Excuse me, but I'm very confident
with what I made today.

105
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,228
Is something wrong with your tongue?

106
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:41,276
It's disgusting!!!

107
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:41,651
It's disgusting!!!

108
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:42,027
It's disgusting!!!

109
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:42,652
It's disgusting!!!

110
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:45,947
i can't take this at all!

111
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:48,784
Right, everyone?!

112
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,119
How can we eat this?

113
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,831
The soup's super horrible!

114
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,666
We can't drink up this crap!

115
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,376
This is just awful. Can somebody
get me some water?

116
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:01,088
What're you bastards up to?

117
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,091
You're just a phony chef assistant.

118
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:05,792
You've just been around a while, that's all.

119
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,970
We're tired of your violent behavior!

120
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,740
It tastes so bad, we just had to say it aloud.

121
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,159
What did you say?!

122
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,355
We're cooks of the sea.

123
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:21,900
We can't afford to waste even a single drop of soup.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,876
Owner!!

125
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:40,919
Old man?!

126
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:46,550
What's up with this disgusting soup of yours?

127
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:50,137
Do you intend to shut this restaurant
down or something?

128
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:52,931
Stop kidding around, old fart!

129
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,184
Tell me what makes your soup
and mine any different!

130
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:57,060
Tell me!

131
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,854
Between mine and yours?

132
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:03,650
Don't be so conceited!

133
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:08,697
The boss didn't kick him, but punched him!

134
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:15,203
You're a hundred years too young
to compare to me, lil' eggplant!

135
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,541
For I am the man who has cooked on
all of the seas, all over the world.

136
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:30,469
Damn it!

137
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:30,761
Damn it!

138
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,517
Damn old fart.

139
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,917
I... I...

140
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:44,858
i'm no li'l eggplant no more!!

141
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:54,743
This soup's great!

142
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,828
I know so.

143
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:59,706
Sanji's cooking is revered by everyone here.

144
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:00,415
Sanji's cooking is revered by everyone here.

145
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,333
Sanji's cooking is revered by everyone here.

146
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:03,001
It doesn't taste bad at all.

147
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:03,710
It doesn't taste bad at all.

148
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:06,379
Yeah, it's well made.

149
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,092
Man, that was scary, he seemed pretty mad.

150
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:10,801
Yeah, he was.

151
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:20,352
But, if we didn't pull this off, he'd never leave,

152
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:21,770
That stupid brat.

153
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:25,357
Hey kid!

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,277
You mentioned that you needed
a cook on your ship, right?

155
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,988
I'm not trying to force you or anything,

156
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,440
but that li'l eggplant of ours,

157
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:36,201
Care to take him with you?

158
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:38,662
To the Grand Line.

159
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,251
The Grand Line is what he's always dreamed about.

160
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,965
You see, the boss is a real troublemaker.

161
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,677
I was worried for a sec with your crappy acting.

162
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,472
Not to mention yours.

163
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:58,932
Another helping of soup please!

164
00:10:59,015 --> 00:10:59,975
Me too! Me too!

165
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,453
I can hear everything, you damn bastards.

166
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:25,459
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

167
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:32,507
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

168
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,637
How 'bout it, kid?

169
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:39,306
No.

170
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:40,599
What?!

171
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,811
Didn't you say you need a cook on your ship?

172
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:49,649
Or do you not like the guy?

173
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,780
It's nothing like that. I want to take him with me,

174
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,825
But he said that he wanted to stay here as a cook.

175
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:02,037
I can't take him along even if you guys insist.

176
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:07,501
So you're saying that you can't do anything
about it unless he says ''Yes''?

177
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:09,669
Exactly. Seconds please!

178
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,797
Yeah, that's obviously best.

179
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,968
But that peculiar kid, would he just
admit that he wants to go?

180
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,554
Not a chance.

181
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,973
He's a stubborn son of a gun.

182
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:22,641
Seconds please!

183
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:56,675
Damnit...

184
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:57,509
Sanji?

185
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:58,677
Who's he?

186
00:12:58,827 --> 00:12:59,569
A merman?

187
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:02,347
He came all the way from a
merman island to eat here!?

188
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,764
Idiot!

189
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,474
It's just somebody in a shark's jaw!

190
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:06,217
Hm? What's going on?

191
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,019
Eh, Yosaku?

192
00:13:08,562 --> 00:13:10,439
Oh, Luffy-aniki!

193
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,374
Why are you the only one here?

194
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,266
Where's everybody else?

195
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,125
Where's Nami?

196
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,385
We didn't catch up with her.

197
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,737
But from the direction she was headed,

198
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:28,165
we roughly knew her destination.

199
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,992
Humm... Why didn't you bring her back then?

200
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,395
Well, about that...

201
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,381
If her destination really is...

202
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,508
where we calculated,

203
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,968
it'd be a dangerous place.

204
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:44,681
Anyways, we need your help.

205
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:45,807
Please come with me!

206
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:46,975
Yosh!

207
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,102
I don't really get it... but I get it!

208
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:50,036
Let's go!

209
00:13:58,862 --> 00:13:59,404
Wait.

210
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:03,950
All of us hold on to foolish dreams.

211
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:11,741
I'm gonna do this for my own dream, for All Blue.

212
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:13,835
Sanji?

213
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,339
As you wanted, I'll go with you.

214
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:19,341
On this ''Road to the Pirate King''

215
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,779
Allow me take up the position
of cook aboard your ship.

216
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:32,037
You got a problem with that or what?

217
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,939
YEESS!!!

218
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:35,649
Great!

219
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:36,942
Isn't this great, Luffy-aniki?

220
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,446
Yay! Yay! We got our cook!

221
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,223
We'll always have something to eat now!

222
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,949
So that's it, people.

223
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:44,157
So that's it, people.

224
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,536
I gave you a lot of trouble, didn't I?

225
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,289
Man, you piss me off.

226
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:53,750
I wanted to throw you out of here myself,

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,878
But now things turn out to be easy.

228
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,381
Well, I'm sorry...

229
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,800
That's what you get for putting on
such an appalling performance.

230
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,927
Wha- you figured us out?!

231
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:06,711
You couldn't be any more transparent.
You're all morons.

232
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:07,489
What?

233
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:12,010
So you guys really want me outta here, eh?

234
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:12,969
Eh, old fart?

235
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:17,691
What's with that foul-mouth of yours?!

236
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,487
That's right, you li'l eggplant.

237
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,407
I hate kids!

238
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:30,871
I regret every passing day that
I let you live, ungrateful kid.

239
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,874
That's just nice, old fart.

240
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,785
Now you can sit back and relax
for the rest of your life.

241
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,094
Oh! Nice ship there!

242
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,462
You sure we can use this?

243
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:49,222
It's Sanji's, so of course you can.

244
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,184
Aren't you done yet?

245
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:53,894
Nope, more meat please.

246
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,938
How many days are you gonna be sailing?

247
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,856
Dunno.

248
00:15:59,357 --> 00:15:59,900
Kid!

249
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:01,309
Oh, old man.

250
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:02,702
You want this?

251
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:06,782
It's my journal during the year
i ventured the Grand Line.

252
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:08,817
Don't need it!

253
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,203
Thought so.

254
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,698
I want that frozen beef up there!

255
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:19,394
Can't you cut it out!?

256
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,804
Awesome!

257
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:32,099
Old fart, so this is our floating restaurant?

258
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:55,455
Hey, Sanji...

259
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,624
Eh? What?

260
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,710
No matter what kind of bad guy,

261
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:04,756
even if he's a fugitive,

262
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,094
as long as they're bastards who come here to eat,

263
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:15,976
Then our struggle here would be meaningful.

264
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,064
We'll be very busy from now on.

265
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,984
No problem, 'coz I'm here!

266
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:38,331
Gimme a break...

267
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,669
The peel's still too thick! Li'l eggplant!

268
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,213
That hurts!

269
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,551
You should watch quietly when people are focused on their cooking!

270
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,511
Who do you think you are?

271
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:52,679
You li'l eggplant!

272
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,349
I'm no li'l eggplant, you old fart!

273
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,854
Try it!

274
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,023
Did you make this yourself?

275
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:07,527
And?

276
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,114
Man, this tastes awful, li'l eggplant!

277
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:13,950
Why... you old fart!

278
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,254
Cook-aniki's rather slow, isn't he?

279
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:45,565
This is the fury I've accumulated for years!

280
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,567
Prepare yourself, Sanji!

281
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:55,951
You can never beat him.

282
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:15,720
Let's go.

283
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:17,973
You sure? No goodbyes?

284
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:19,474
Nah.

285
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,059
Sanji!

286
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:24,104
Don't catch cold now...

287
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,623
OWNER ZEFF!

288
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:27,125
All this time,

289
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,753
I owe you a hell of a lot!

290
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,422
What you've done for me,

291
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:34,299
I shall never forget!

292
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:58,031
You damn bastard!

293
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,744
I'm gonna miss you, damnit!

294
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:04,704
Gonna miss you alright!

295
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:20,679
This is so sad!

296
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:22,764
I'm so sad, damnit!

297
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,690
You morons!

298
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,986
Men should just leave without saying a word.

299
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:46,496
Let's go!

300
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,750
'Til we meet again, you freakin' bastards!

301
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,766
With the belief and refusal to die,

302
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:13,607
They will find All Blue.

303
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,362
Alright men! Customers will be flooding in soon!

304
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,157
Get back to work!

1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

13
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

14
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,280
Your desire does not lie within this country!

20
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,150
Am I wrong?

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,230
You're fighting for someone else's desire!

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,820
Why would you die for that!?

23
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,700
Like I said...

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,750
You don't understand anything.

25
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,010
Vivi...

26
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,000
She tells others not to die...

27
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,120
But she's the first one who throws her life away to save someone else.

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,580
That's why I'm saying you should just abandon such an annoying-

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,710
I DON'T WANT HER TO DIE!

30
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,880
WE'RE NAKAMA!

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,700
Vivi-sama...

32
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,990
Devoting my life to the service of the Nefertari Family...

33
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,900
...fills my heart with such everlasting pride.

34
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,440
I am a Guardian Spirit of Arabasta!

35
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,370
The Falcon!

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,250
One who destroys the enemies of the Royal Family!

37
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:32,830
It exceeds!
It rains to Alabasta!

38
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,090
Pell...

39
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,040
That crazy bastard...

40
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,700
He protected the country.

41
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,210
Oi

42
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,610
You gotta be kidding me...

43
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,220
Wait...

44
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,240
Please stop, all of you...!

45
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,500
Sergeant Major, watch out!

46
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,690
What?

47
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,430
Tashigi...

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,040
Watch what happens to this country very carefully.

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,980
This is the kind of thing that happens at the turning point of an era.

50
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,540
Madness...

51
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,760
Why... don't they stop?

52
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,140
PLEASE STOP FIGHTING!

53
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
PLEASE...

PLEASE...

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,790

PLEASE...

PLEASE...

73
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,020

PLEASE...

PLEASE...

77
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,350
STOP FIGHTING!

78
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,630
You idiot...

79
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,520
You three!

80
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,490
What the hell are you standing around for!?

81
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,150
Punch them, kick them! Anything!
Whatever you have to do to stop the rebellion!

82
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,320
Hurry up and GO!

83
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,020
Save as mary lives as possible!

84
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,630
PLEASE...

85
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
STOP FIGHTING!

86
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,880
PLEASE...

87
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,040
STOP FIGHTING!

88
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,700
PLEASE...

89
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,570
STOP FIGHTING!

90
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,680
PLEASE...

91
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,730
STOP FIGHTING!

92
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,440
PLEASE...

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,520
STOP FIGHTING!

94
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,620
At long last...

95
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,630
The new era has begun.

96
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,720
The day my ambition becomes reality!

97
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,490
This country is MINE!

98
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,490
I DON'T WANT HER TO DIE!

99
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,200
WE'RE NAKAMA!

100
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,100
That's why as long as she doesn't give up on her country...

101
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,810
We won't stop fighting!

102
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,520
You... can't...

103
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,380
...defeat me!

104
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,610
Are those the only words you can squeeze out?

105
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,030
A bluff from a dog about to meet his death...

106
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,260
How fitting.

107
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,750
Groundless!

108
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,250
I am...

109
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,870
...the man who will become the Pirate King!

110
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,920
Listen, boy.

111
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,310
The more you get to know this sea, the more you learn not to make impudent statements like that.

112
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,190
I already told you...

113
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,780
There are so mary rookies just like you on this sea!

114
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,100
The more you learn about the level of this sea...

115
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,220
THE MORE YOU LOSE SIGHT OF THOSE DREAMS!

116
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,940
I am...

117
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,560
...the man who will surpass you!

118
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,710
The scorpion poison should have taken effect.

119
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,970
Where's this kid...

120
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,000
...drawing all this power from?

121
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,740
The Mr. 5 Pair was defeated, you say?

122
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,350
Who the hell could beat them?

123
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,060
Monkey D. Luffy?

124
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,900
Never heard of him.

125
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,350
Hah. You must be mistaken.

126
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,020
What?

127
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,270
Are you telling me they're still alive!?

128
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,220
Sir Crocodile.

129
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Those pirates have entered the city.

130
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,800
You're just some kid who showed up out of nowhere!

131
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,660
JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?

132
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,970
I don't give a shit who you are!

133
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,010
I WILL SURPASS YOU!

134
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,480
I'll destory you along with this temple!

135
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,530
SANDS

136
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,270
HEAVY

137
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,210
GOMU GOMU NO...

138
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,910
DESERT

139
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,270
STORM!

140
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,860
LA SPADA

141
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,640
Incredible!

142
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,570
There is only pure bedrock between this room and the surface!

143
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,520
Stop!

144
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,200
Oi, look! Up there!

145
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,310
CROCODILE!

146
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,370
At this rate, blood will soon be shed throughout the country!

147
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,790
It will become war!

148
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,440
Just getting there alive is no longer enough!

149
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,620
I have to get there as soon as possible!

150
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,140
If I don't make it in time,

151
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,910
1,000,000 of my people will engage in meaningless slaughter!

152
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,090
Really?

153
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,760
Then all I have to do to Crocodile...

154
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,820
...is kick his ass, right?

155
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,220
Luffy-san...

156
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,270
Not sure how he got blasted up all the way over there...

157
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,430
HOW ELSE!?

158
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,240
I never had a doubt in my mind...

159
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,410
But now...

160
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,740
HE WON!!

161
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Even when there's no one left to fight...

162
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,290
Please... stop the bloodshed...!

163
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,120
PLEASE STOP FIGHTING!

164
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:51,910
Kohza!

165
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,100
Are you okay, Kohza?

166
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,470
See?

167
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,470
Do not doubt him, Kohza.

168
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,290
The rain shall fall.

169
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,590
The battle...

170
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,730
...is over!

171
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,240
Rain...

172
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,720
The madness has ceased.

173
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,520
The confusion has stayed their weapons...

174
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,380
The smoke is being suppressed by the rain.

175
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,490
PLEASE DON'T...

176
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,120
...FIGHT ANYMORE!!

177
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,170
Vivi's voice is...

178
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,940
...reaching them.

179
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,660
Vivi-sama...

180
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,070
Vivi-sama...

181
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,610
Vivi...

182
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,910
I thought the Princess had gone missing...

183
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,310
Hey, you!

184
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,290
Crocodile-san!

185
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,550
Why did he fall down here?

186
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,250
Crocodile-SAN you say...!?

187
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,380
I'm gonna tell you a thing or two about what he's done to this country!

188
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,740
Oi, wait, wait.

189
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,890
Calm down.

190
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,760
This rain, just as it is falling...

191
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,670
Just as it always has...

192
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,560
...will fall again.

193
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,680
The nightmare... has finally ended!

194
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,910
My thanks.

195
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,650
No problem.

196
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,330
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

197
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,250
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

198
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,510
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

199
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,930
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

200
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:36,190
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

201
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,400
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

202
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

203
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

204
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,120
Let's paint a story of the future

205
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,370
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

206
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,420
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

207
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,420
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

208
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,380
A never ending journey to be together.

209
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,380
A never ending journey to be together.

210
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,590
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

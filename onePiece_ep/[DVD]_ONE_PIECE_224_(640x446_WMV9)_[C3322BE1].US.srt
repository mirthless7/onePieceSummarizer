1
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,400
Zoro!

2
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,200
And Luffy?

3
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,920
Was Luffy made kill by Zoro?

4
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,980
Not… It is impossible…

5
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
Where is the captain?

6
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,140
Whore of swashbuckler!

7
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,810
If you intend to make evil with these young ladies, I will be your adversary.

8
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,410
“I have still a chart to play”

9
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:58,610
The true robber of memory.

10
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:58,610
Counter-attack final!

11
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,150
Yes!!!

12
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,110
I am… me!

13
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,630
Me too!

14
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,250
Aren't you a customer normally?

15
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,690
Cavity how I am it!

16
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,050
Why am I equipped like that?

17
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Owner, whom do you make?

18
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,650
Turn over to the reception!

19
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,150
Ah yes, it is true. I am the owner.

20
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,200
Mom, where were you all this time?

21
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,330
I excuses, you are well?

22
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,620
Yes! My memory… I found the memory!

23
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,910
Listen to me all! It is horrible!

24
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,830
Would this be Drim?

25
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,290
Am not afraid.

26
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,490
Drim! Drim!

27
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,140
Mom! Mom!

28
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,680
How are you?

29
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,450
Mom!

30
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,750
It would seem that everyone found its memory.

31
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,920
Thank you my God!

32
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,880
But what did it occur?

33
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,270
Listen to me all! It is horrible!

34
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,460
Those which stole our reports are in the forest!

35
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,150
How?

36
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,840
What is what he says?

37
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,320
“Deals with them, Rorornoa Zoro! ”…

38
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,920
He said.

39
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,710
But then…

40
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,570
He is really under his control!

41
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,880
He, ridges something!

42
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,540
Frankly!

43
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,130
This foutu swashbuckler causes us constantly problems!

44
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,240
Sanji, pay attention!

45
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,140
“I have time now!”

46
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Do not interfere yourself that!

47
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,180
Stupid cook!

48
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,820
Oh, they are over there!

49
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,090
ZORO!

50
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,440
You are well?

51
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,760
Luffy! How is what you insane?!

52
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,080
Did Zoro, you say “Luffy”?

53
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,410
You found the memory?

54
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,040
Of course!

55
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,330
Your face was really alarming!

56
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,330
If you found the memory, you must smile, like that!

57
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,980
You will close it!

58
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,710
Who am I?

59
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,410
Hein!?

60
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,300
Do not make the things more difficult!

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,820
He, Zoro! You really hurt me!

62
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,330
Ridges as you want!

63
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,830
Thank you my God. Everyone returned to the normal.

64
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,160
Robin-chan, who discovered the true culprit, is really beautiful!

65
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,650
It was him?

66
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,180
You found your memory in first, why you in board you not returned account?!

67
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,340
They is false! I am better than Zoro!

68
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,220
And? Where is this bastard?

69
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,010
He fled?

70
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,940
Not.

71
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,340
One can see you through.

72
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,040
He. It becomes blue.

73
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,640
Why doesn't he flee?

74
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,300
Instead of hiding…

75
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,180
Rot!!! How you dared to make use of me!

76
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,160
I you will catch and you étriper!

77
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,430
“You humiliated me”.

78
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,250
“He! I catches if you can it!”

79
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,240
“He, wait!”

80
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,110
“Will not arrive to You there!”

81
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,840
“Yosh… It is what one will see!”

82
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,730
“I am too fast for you!”

83
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,890
“Eh? I do not believe myself!”

84
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,550
“If I am serious!”

85
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,420
“I hold you!”

86
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,580
“I will not release myself!”

87
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,030
You will be the next one, Usopp!

88
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,260
“I have still a chart to play!”

89
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,360
It is impossible!

90
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Belmer-san?

91
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,970
Doctor!

92
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,990
Kaya!

93
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,130
You are cured?

94
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,420
How is that?

95
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,210
They all are…

96
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,310
The reflection of each one of their memory.

97
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,710
You want to fight?! I go you botter the bottom!

98
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,590
What is what it is?

99
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,730
Oh not!

100
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,140
What is what he says?

101
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,330
“Because of you, I lost all the memories of the inhabitants!”

102
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,230
“But if I recover all your invaluable memories, I would become one about it!”

103
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,580
To become what?

104
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,980
I do not know!

105
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,140
“I will not let pass this occasion!”

106
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,980
It is what this trick!?

107
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,820
And…

108
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,930
Who am I?

109
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,210
Who are you?

110
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,890
Who? Me? Ho!

111
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Who am I? Hein?

112
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,400
He, a guy who drowns!

113
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,110
You know it?

114
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,820
ME EITHER!

115
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,330
[Sennenryu = 1000 years old dragon]

116
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,330
“Finally! I became Sennenryu!”

117
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,540
You!

118
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,880
Incredible! You include/understand what he says?

119
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,520
The tanuki speaks!

120
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,520
[Tanuki:left raccoon]

121
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,720
I am a tanuki?!

122
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,040
A speaking tanuki and Sennenryu…

123
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,110
A moron who drowns…

124
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,250
What is what occurs?

125
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,620
Although I see only one dragon…

126
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,000
I feel in anger! Why?!

127
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,770
Who? What? Where? When?

128
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,760
Strange! Why am I here?

129
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,260
Incredible!

130
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,990
A dragon? I will overlap it!

131
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,560
Baka! It is possible no to reach it from here…

132
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,040
You cannot say that without to have tested!

133
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,590
It is what that!?

134
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,770
What is what it is? My arms and my legs lengthen!

135
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,750
It is brilliant!

136
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,650
How it does that…

137
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,280
How is what arrives at its body?!

138
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,520
It is a monster!

139
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,920
Do not do that, they are dangerous!

140
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,380
Ca seems painful.

141
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,460
“Stops! I lose the memories!”

142
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,690
Memories?

143
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,590
How much time still…

144
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,510
You will steal us our reports!

145
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,480
Bastard!

146
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,960
How is what he says, Chopper!

147
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,580
“Chopper”?

148
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,340

Hein?

151
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,770
“I finally became Sennenryu! Leave me quiet!”

152
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,060
What?!

153
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,380
The memories of people do not belong to you!

154
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,520
If you want to become Sennenryu, do it with your own memories!

155
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,630
“Keep silent yourself! Take that! It is finished for you!”

I have boot to him the bottom!

162

But…

163
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,220
Isn't a sennenryu born in an egg normally?

164
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,050
If. It would not have changed just by swallowing memories.

165
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,490
It is true?

166
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,900
Yes. You probably do not know that, but we saw one of our own eyes of them while entering on Grand Line.

167
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,900
Well, in any case! I bet that the village is become again merry now!

168
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,000
We are the heroes who made find the memory with the villagers!

169
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,490
We without any doubt will be treated like heroes!

170
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,870
I will be able to perhaps drink at will?

171
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
Didn't Ca, you forget it?

172
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,520
The farm!

173
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,880
We can also await us full with rewards!

174
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,490
I want a bronze statue!

175
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,310
I will be able to take all that I want…

177
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,130
If you could have all that you want, you would take what?

178
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,740
A book perhaps?

179
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,350
Yes, perhaps the historical book of this island, if possible.

180
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,260
Of course! Then I want full with books of medicine!

181
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,340
I see the houses.

182
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,690
Oyé Oyé, Mesdames and Sirs! Thank you for this cordial reception!

It is them!

185
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,670

186
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,870
What it occurs?!

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,720
Usopp!

188
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,770
Aren't we of the heroes!?

189
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,370
I do not know! It is what I believed!

190
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,760
Nami-san, where is the waver?!

191
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,060
By there!

192
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,470
Wait, pirate! Wait!

193
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,110
Robbers of memory!

194
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,460
You will pay it!

195
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,760
How is what they have?!

196
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,480
They take to us for someone else!

197
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,290
He would seem yes.

198
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,980
My faith, we are pirates.

199
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,410
One can nothing make there.

200
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,820
Then we must act even as cause of despair!

201
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,780
He! Stop!

202
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,130
What would make a pirate in this kind of situation?!

203
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,860
He you!

204
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,950
I am glad to be of return.

205
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,890
When I think…

206
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,530
That I could have had a large statue.

207
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,440
Large and alarming…

208
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,710
But I did not think that amnesia could pose problems so much.

209
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,330
Yes.

210
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,600
There was of it one which tried to convince everyone to belong to its crew.

211
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,450
Sanji-kun, it was right to laugh…

212
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,230
There was also a cretin who completely left embobiner.

213
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,650
What?!

214
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,060
If you had not slept at the guardroom, all this could have been avoided!

215
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,560
Stupid marimo!

216
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,810
You close it! I try to sleep!

217
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,510
If you want to sleep so much, passes your life to sleep!

218
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,520
The calm one! Enough!

219
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,090
Want you to lose your memory again?!

220
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,830
Nami-san, do not say that!

221
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,450
My memories…

222
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,810
If I lost all my memories…

223
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,440
I…

224
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,430
What there is it, Robin?

225
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,490
All is well. I am just tired.

226
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,430
Yes. Robin-chan did not sleep because of all these events.

227
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,330
It is true.

228
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,830
Yosh! I will have a good meal this evening.

229
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,350
Meal! I had completely forgotten!

230
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,590
Sanji! Make me eat!

231
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,760
I will do it, then sit down and wait a little!

232
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,000
He, Luffy!

233
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,300
Why didn't you return with Zoro the other time?

234
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,310
And well, I was wedged under the rock that Zoro had split…

235
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,120
A rock?

236
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,930
Yes! It was so large that I could not raise it!

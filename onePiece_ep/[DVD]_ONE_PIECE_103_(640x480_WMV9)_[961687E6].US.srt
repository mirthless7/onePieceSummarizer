1
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:38,570
In Spiders Coffee

2
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:38,570
The meeting of the leaders at 8 p.m.

3
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,390
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,600
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,250
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,530
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,660
With an aim of stopping the rebellious army, Princess Vivi wishes to meet and discuss with her Leader.

8
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,810
They have just left the city in ruin of Erumalu, and are on the way for the oasis of Yuba.

9
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,850
Eh Luffy!

10
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,460
It is what this thing which your brother gave you?

11
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,140
Bah, I do not know too much.

12
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,290
It is right a piece of paper.

13
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,670
A piece of paper?

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,940
Let see me that.

15
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,820
It is really right a piece of paper.

16
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,090
It is not a post-it or another thing.

17
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,850
For what that is used then?

18
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
I do not know either…

19
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,080
EH! DOES NOT EAT IT!

20
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,610
Imbecile.

21
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,460
Luffy, gives me your hat.

22
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,470
Hein? That one?

23
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,230
If it is also important, I will sew it on the back of the ribbon.

24
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,460
Oh, thank you!

25
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,350
Do that well!

26
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,560
Yes, yes.

27
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,590
Here it is done.

28
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,380
They is good, take again it.

29
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,560
Thank you!

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,970
Now I will not have to worry any more!

31
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,860
There is really nothing writing above.
Is this really important if you lose it or not?

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,170
Ace said to me to keep it with me, then I keep it.

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,340
Your confidence is ridiculous.

34
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,180
Leave me quiet!
All always goes for best with me.

35
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,740
What?

36
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,260
What?

37
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,740
What?

38
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,420
Really?

39
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,190
Zoro, carries me.

40
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,610
Everyone, once we will have passed this rock, we will be almost in Yuba.

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,320
Let us continue to advance still a little.

42
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,480
Ouais!

43
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,820
Yuba!

44
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,960
Ouais, Yuba.

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,090
Yuba!

46
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,530
Ah, Zoro, carry me.

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,030
Get stuffed!

48
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,340
Can one?

49
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,520
Also carry me, Zoro!

50
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,800
Burst!

51
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,900
The plan starts in two days.

52
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,140
Did you very arrange?

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,640
Yes, without any difficulty.

54
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,410
I set up 150 Billions at Nanohana.

55
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,360
Mr. 2 was also pointed out.

56
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,750
It would seem that he did not succeed in catching Mr. 3.

57
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,450
The Agents remaining Officers meet this evening.

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,950
Spiders Coffee, at 8 p.m.

59
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
Very well.

60
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,630
It is already 17:30.

61
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,880
They will start soon to gather.

62
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,590
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

63
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,910
Merry Chri… Merry Chri…!

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,220
A little tired!

65
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,510
Badly with the back!

66
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,500
Miss Merry Christmas

67
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,370
And zut! It is of your fault, Mr. 4!

68
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,710
You are so tedious that you gave me badly to the back!

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,030
P---With---R---D---O---NR

70
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,420
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,890
Are Paula, how the businesses?
It is completely empty today, not?

72
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,870
Place vacuum.

73
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,430
Pla- VI.

74
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,830
Pla…

75
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,800
P…! Isn't this?

76
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,820
Ca made a long time.

77
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,460
Welcome, Miss Merry Christmas, Mr. 4.

78
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:57,230
Paula

79
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,250
The Coffee was reserved for you today.

80
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,440
You will take Pekoe Orange.

81
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,440
Black tea very strong fact starting from whole sheets…

82
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,980
… and Mr. 4 you a tea with apple, isn't this will take?

83
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,850
I do not want it hot!

84
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,430
I it want at an ideal temperature to be able to drink it immediately!

85
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,460
Now, the-I gives quickly!

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,240

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,860
Bring the-me!

88
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,840
Give the-me!

89
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,390
You seem in the fine shape.

90
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,950
How is work?

91
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,060
It is always also shitting which of hab!

92
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,390
Of course, we are in form.

93
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,060
Idiot!

94
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,700
Idiot!

95
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,060
Idiot, id… id…

96
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,480
You must be right.

97
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,710
I excuse myself.

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,040
One, two!

99
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,090
Ora!

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,950
One, two!

101
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,880
Kura!

102
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,380
What is it that?

103
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,770
You play the funny ones of songs in this coffee?

104
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,220
A song?

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,780
Not, it is a sonata which one hears, not a song.

106
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,350
One, two!

107
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,630
Ora!

108
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,790
Hein?

109
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,900
One, two!

110
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,110
Kura!

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,090
Look at your fingers with your nose!

112
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,000
One, two!

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,940
Kura!

114
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,720
Kick on the side!

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,440
One, two!

116
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,760
Ora!

117
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,760
Time…

118
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,370
… before our birth…

119
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,360
Lesson!

120
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,530
Lesson!

121
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,470
Eyes and…

122
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,070
… will mascara it!

123
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,860
Let us speak…

124
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,680
… of will mascara!

125
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,900
Practice each day!

126
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,260
It is… the ideal…

127
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,830
Lesson!

128
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,900
Lesson!

129
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,020
Lesson!

130
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,250
Lesson!

131
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,140
It is the way of the transvestite!

132
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,290
Yes, smile everyone!

133
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,950
Ah, most extremely!

134
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,780
Most extremely!

135
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,320
Most extremely!

136
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,340
Most extremely!

137
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,810
Oh am my way!

138
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,390
Hello at the assembly!

139
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,810
Thank you.

140
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,150
How I was?

141
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
You resemble an idiot.

142
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,030
I am not an idiot, Paula!

143
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,220
Why you requests?

144
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,410
Because I am a dancer.

145
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,340
I must have a poulpa.

146
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,250
A “poulpa”?

147
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,290
Stop joking!

148
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,570
A perfect octopus.

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,560
That goes from oneself!

150
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,960
Eh, the guy.

151
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,240
You all can set out again now.

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,180
Yes!

153
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,780
Do not forget to practice the dance!

154
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,850
Yes!

155
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,010
One, two!

156
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,990
One, two!

157
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,290
My large! The old woman!
You are already there?

158
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,950
You will keep silent yourself, brothel!?

159
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,770
Ca goes directly in my back, then stops with your cries!

160
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,910
Ah! It is true, it is true!

161
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,520
It even appears that the duet of Mr. 1
will come this time, hein?

162
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,100
I never met them…

163
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,140
Thus I am, how could I say…

164
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,360
I await them impatiently!

165
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,600
Ah…

166
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,910
The night…

167
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,700
It is so dark…

168
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,450
It is almost the hour, 20 hours.

169
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,890
I am bored!

170
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,850
I am bored so much that I think that I will turn!

171
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,990
I am turning!

172
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,100
ME!

173
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,900
Ca only hurts me to look at you then stops that.

174
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,900
What is there, the old woman?

175
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,780
You want a piece of it!?

176
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,360
If you think that you can have me!

177
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,570
Wait!

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,920
Please, you calm both.

179
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,270
Did qu qu What arrive to you, the guy!?

180
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,510
Why did you pass through the wall?

181
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,600
N- Not… It is him…!

182
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,610
What?

183
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,700
You know them?

184
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,070
They had an odd behavior outside in the desert.

185
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,880
What?

186
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,140
It is not as if they were about to die.

187
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,720
You seem rather close.

188
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,720
Tattooing, an old way of writing “1”

189
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,040
But from the relations of no importance to only will harm you.

190
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,740
They are my men!

191
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,420
Stop, Mr. 2!

192
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,220
What is it that?

193
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,330
He passed easily through the wall!

194
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,200
Not… Did it break the wall?

195
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,790
You thus chose to die.

196
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,960
Wait.

197
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,800
I must stop you, Mr. 1.

198
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,630
Remain apart from that, Miss Doubles Finger.

199
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,050
I will kill it.

200
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,870
Really!

201
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,690
Stop! Let to me go there, the large one!

202
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,940
Mr. 2, do you want to calm you well?

203
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,200
Ah, will you leave, at the end!?

204
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,070
Stop that now!

205
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,010
It is 8 p.m.

206
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,660
All the indicated Agents are joined together.

207
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,050
And an order was delivered in Spiders Café.

208
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,890
We must travel towards the City of the Dreams, Rainbase.

209
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,060
The man that we call Boss,
and we never saw the face…

210
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,670
… awaits us over there.

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,460
They should leave for Rainbase about now.

212
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,490
I sent Banchi to escort them.

213
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,020
They should arrive a little later during the night.

214
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,620
Who could have thought that you were Miss Double Finger…

215
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,270
Miss Doubles Finger

216
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,960
I do not remember to have said that I was not it.

217
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,510
Did one find substitutes for the Billions which were killed in Nanohana?

218
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,430
The substitutes are already in place.

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,970
I sent Erimaki to deliver the new orders with the Billions.

220
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,160
Well.

221
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,280
All is well.

222
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,860
Ah, over there.

223
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,460
I saw something shining.

224
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,560
Do we Somme in Yuba?

225
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,680
There is so much sand which flies that I cannot say to you.

226
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,340
Which is this sound…?

227
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,060
There is something which bell here!

228
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,120
A tempête de sable!

229
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,930
Yuba is devastated by a tempête de sable!

230
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,380
Oh not…

231
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,450
They is rather bad…

232
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,600
This place is hardly worth better than the town of Erumalu.

233
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,090
Where is water?

234
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,900
It is not supposed being an oasis, Vivi-Chan?

235
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,490
The sand level climbed…

236
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,160
The oasis was absorbed…

237
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,840
You, isn't this is travellers?

238
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,560
You must be tired by your voyage through the desert.

239
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,590
I am sorry. It seems that this city is a little bit dry for the moment.

240
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,280
But I think that you will be able nevertheless to put back you a little before setting out again.

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,470
If you seek inns, there is full.

242
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,460
After all, it is thanks to that we are known.

243
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,950
Excuse me…

244
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,890
We intended to say that the rebellious army used this city as bases…

245
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,410
What do you have to see with the rebellious army!?

246
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,350
Me known as step which you want to join them!

247
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,050
He! He! Qu What…?

248
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,850
What are you making?

249
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,220
You could hurt us!

250
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,000
Stop that!

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,260
Stop!

252
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,990
These insane already left.

253
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
What do you say!?

254
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,030
It is not true!

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,950
You the tempête de sable which has just blown, isn't this saw?

256
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,380
It is not the first.

257
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,970
These three long years of dryness made assemble the level of sand.

258
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,770
And the tempêtes de sable did not stop devastating this city.

259
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,200
Absorbed gradually, the large oasis of the past is now in the state where see it to you.

260
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:42,490
Without the trade of the city to help them, the prolonged war of the rebellious army could not continue.

261
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,580
They moved towards Katorea.

262
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,040
Katorea?

263
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,550
Where is it, Vivi?

264
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,640
Is Katorea close to us?

265
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,450
It is the oasis very close to Nanohana.

266
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,810
Katorea!? It is the city where I met Matsuge!

267
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,450
“When you saved me…”

268
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,460
Matsuge says that it supplied the rebels of the town of Katorea.

269
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,630
Why you did not say it to us, dumb of camel!?

270
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,940
I you emmerde…

271
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,530
Do not say “Bwwaa” like that, filth of camel.

272
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,800
Thus we made all this way for nothing?

273
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,120
Vivi…

274
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,890
You have just called it “Vivi”…

275
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,530
Ossan = Large father

276
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,530
He, Ossan!

277
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,940
VIVI IS NOT a PRINCESS OR a TRICK IN the KIND!

278
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,200
DO NOT SAY TO HIM, IMBECILE!

279
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,390
Es you Vivi-Chan?

280
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,610
It is you?

281
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,510
You are still in life.

282
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,780
I am so content!

283
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,500
It is me.

284
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,940
Don't you recognize me?

285
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
I can include/understand…

286
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,460
I lost a little weight…

287
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,600
Louse-Ojisan…

288
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,410
Yes.

289
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,880
It is that.

290
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,110
Not…

291
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,160
So long, Vivi-Chan.

292
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,370
We will not see we during a small moment.

293
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,040
Once the city will be finished, come to visit us!

294
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,080
Yes! Louse-Ojisan!

295
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,520
Yuba will make this country prosperous, it is sure.

296
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,500
It is sure…

297
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,580
Louse… Ojisan?

298
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,410
Listen to me, Vivi-Chan.

299
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,210
I rely on the King.

300
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,190
He is not the kind of anybody who could betray his country.

301
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,310
Isn't this?

302
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,870
This rebellion is ridiculous…!

303
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,530
These imbeciles…

304
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,850
It has not rained for three years. And then?

305
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,150
I rely on the King.

306
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,020
And a large part of the country too.

307
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,950
Many times…

308
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,220
Many times, I tried to stop them.

309
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,090
But no matter what I say, it was always in vain.

310
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,940
This rebellion will not cease.

311
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,380
Their force already reached his limit.

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,220
They intend all to stop with their last attack.

313
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,720
They are with end.

314
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,680
They intend to die!

315
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,890
Please… Vivi-Chan!

316
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,980
Stop these imbeciles, please!

317
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:38,340
Sit of the rebellion

318
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,390
Where is the Leader?

319
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,150
Inside.

320
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,310
Louse-Ojisan.

321
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,910
Do not worry you.

322
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,780
Vivi-Chan…

323
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,610
I will stop the rebellion.

324
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,770
Thank you!

325
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,860
So long, Vivi-Chan.

326
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,380
We will not see we during a small moment.

327
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,050
Once the city will be finished, come to visit us!

328
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Yes! Louse-Ojisan!

329
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,550
We will create an incredible city and will help the country to become prosperous!

330
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,220
So long, Vivi!

331
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,840
You will become a large Princess.

332
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,850
Yes!

333
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,860
Kohza.

334
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,880
We received contacts of our forces of the other cities.

335
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,130
It is time for us to move.

336
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,170
Yes.

337
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,700
The problem is that we always miss arm.

338
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,460
No importance, we have the choice, we must act.

339
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,150
This country…

340
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,670
We go…

341
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,680
… to protect it.

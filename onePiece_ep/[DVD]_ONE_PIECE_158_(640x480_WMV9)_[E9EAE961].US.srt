1
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,480
Luffy and its crew succeeded
to escape the White Berets.

2
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,100
At this point in time a creature of God appears and removes Nami and three other members of the crew.

3
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
In any case, if one wants to find
our companions and our boat…

4
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,690
It is necessary to pass by the main door.

5
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,819
Here thus Ordalie
that one must undergo…

6
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,340
The Celestial Judgment?

7
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,730
Yes, you must face the power
unimaginable of the four Priests of Upper Yard.

8
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,430
What? Then it is all considering.

9
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,100
To make short… Botter is owed
is the bottom of these Priests, it that?

10
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,140
You take that with light like always.

11
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,060
The things become interesting.

12
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,730
raburiitoori No wana

13
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,730
Trap has Lovely Street!

14
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,730
Eneru, Very Powerful God

15
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,730
zennounaru goddo eneru

16
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,939
He, Luffy!

17
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,789
You await us, yes?

18
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,310
Hein? What?

19
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,239
You ace disappeared from a blow!

20
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,210
Where you go like that?

21
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,549
Did Nami say it, not?

22
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,749
While remaining here, one would attract
troubles with Conis and Papi.

23
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,259
Yes it is true, but
you go where to the Juste?

24
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,030
Where one must go.
The Sacrificial Furnace bridge.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,950
And how do you hope to go there?

26
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,080
YOU DO NOT HAVE THERE THINKS!

27
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,510
Is just enough to steal a boat
and to take Milky Road.

28
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,860
How one will make
to steal a boat?

29
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,919
YOU DO NOT HAVE THERE THINKS!

30
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,890
One is more on the Blue Sea, you know.

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,980
This old chart does not inform us
precisely on the geography of Angel Island.

32
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,990
One does not even know how
to borrow Milky Road.

33
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Ah, not of chance!

34
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,450
Everyone…

35
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,209
Conis-chan!

36
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,940
You made all this way for
us to wish good luck?

37
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,680
My father asked you to me
to lead to the Sacriciel Furnace bridge.

38
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,820
Oh, Pagaya-san?

39
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,589
I will guide you
to the quay of Angel Island.

40
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,830
I will find you a solid boat.

41
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,169
Ah, that it is a good plan!

42
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,269
Not like this moron without
brain which directs us.

43
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,199
Ouais!

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760
I SPOKE ABOUT YOU!

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,360
The fact of being able to make things
with Conis-chan returns to me so happy!

46
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,770
Isn't this, Luffy?

47
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,830
Good, since you came us
to help… then, allons-y!

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
Of agreement!

49
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,699
You will not escape!

50
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,940
To ensure me that you will undergo the Judgment
Celestial, I will send to you to Upper Yard.

51
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,599
It is what this place?

52
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,419
It is Lovely Street.

53
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,300
After having crossed Lovely
Street, we will arrive at the quay.

54
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,079
They move already towards Upper Yard.

55
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,459
We do not need
to follow them like that…

56
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,420
Close it!

57
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,279
All other inhabitants of
the Blue Sea were similar.

58
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,620
They believe initially that it is one
venture dream and they fanfaronnent.

59
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,080
But when their lives are in danger, they start to cry like babies and try to flee.

60
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,240
Really delay me
to arrive at Upper Yard!

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,330
Perhaps you risk
to die over there.

62
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,950
Ouais, one must all die one day.

63
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,979
And doesn't that disturb you?

64
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,830
Not. I am very excited!

65
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,839
Species of idiot,
do not joke with that!

66
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,749
Think a little of
Nami-san and Robin-chan!

67
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,529
And in Merry, Zoro, and Chopper too!

68
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,110
You do not worry for them?!

69
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,710
J I am sorry.

70
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,550
They is cool here!

71
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,590
Lovely Street is only
commercial street of Angel Island.

72
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,490
Look at! Y' has shops
who float in the airs!

73
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,210
They are made of one
special variety of ilonimbus.

74
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,450
Does Y' have stores of Yakiniku here?
[Note:Yakiniku:Roasted meat]

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,070
Here they are.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,159
Continue to go!

77
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,440
Leave quickly from here!

78
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,280
They avoid us?

79
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,749
It is not astonishing.

80
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,849
Our reputation precedes us.

81
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,620
We are criminals.

82
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,219
It is cool that!

83
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,410
One with the main street of
the city only for us!

84
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,640
All the angels avoid me…

85
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,530
He, they sell full
odd tricks here.

86
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,759
They is super! So only
I had a little money!

87
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,970
Perhaps I will be able in
to buy if a treasure is found!

88
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,340
One would say a store of Dials!

89
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,389
If one equips the Vogue-Merry with
two of these enormous Breath-Dial,

90
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,980
it will go perhaps too
quickly how one Waver!

91
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
Luffy, one does not have time to have fun!

92
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,689
Nami-san and the others are
prisoners in the Sacrificial Furnace bridge!

93
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,859
You want really to save them?

94
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,669
To save?

95
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,289
As I said, they are well!

96
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,059
Zoro is trapped with them!

97
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,059
Do not trust this moron!

98
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,019
I hope just that the boat
will not suffer additional damage.

99
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,980
One really does not have it
spared lately.

100
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,730
Oh, Y' has a trick in the middle of the street!

101
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,749
Too much is delirious this head!

102
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,479
It is what this trick?

103
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,499
A woolly seal?

104
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,019
An old woman would be said
headstock in terre cuite…

105
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,969
But it is surely monk.

106
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,819
Moron! It is art!

107
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,209
I know what I speak!

108
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,740
It is Vearth.

109
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,240
The incarnation of the eternal
hope of the inhabitants of the skies.

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,739
Vearth?

111
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,589
Eternal?

112
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,280
You hope for you also a long time?

113
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,340
You are not Nets!

114
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,300
Yes, I imagine that it is not easy with
to include/understand for the inhabitants of the Blue Sea.

115
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,620
The quay is by there!

116
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,850
One from goes away already?

117
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,329
Of course that yes!

118
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,309
One did not come for that, not truth?

119
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,810
One can remain here still a little.

120
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,649
It would be said that went.

121
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,509
They went directly to the quay.

122
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,930
We are safe.

123
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,970
Y' has full with boats!

124
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,590
Several kinds are found
boats moored here.

125
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,300
Ca goes from the boat-hotels
where you can sleep…

126
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,020
… with the boats with large
speed equipped with large Dials.

127
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,370
There are several other models…

128
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,700
Look at this gondole!

129
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,949
Too much terrible!

130
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,440
That one is taken!

131
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,429
Look with the back!

132
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,049
Y' has this trick to advance all
only like Waver, not true?

133
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,069
Ca will be a voyage
delirious in gondole!

134
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,499
Moron.

135
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,799
One will save Nami-san
and Robin-chan!

136
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Would be more serious!

137
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
Your boat is by there!

138
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,089
Of agreement!

139
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,380
Ouais!

140
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,489
I am very excited!

141
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,490
Which kind of gondole it is?

142
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,990
The Small Corbel!

143
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,419
It is a joke?!

144
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,890
A corbel…?

145
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,650
It is not a bird which goes on water.

146
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,870
I used it before
to be able to control Waver.

147
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,220
It is not as fast as Waver,
but it is equipped with two Breath-Dials.

148
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,510
Please, take-there!

149
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,160
Not, I do not go there.

150
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,780
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

151
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,880
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

152
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,280
Not, I do not go there.

153
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,779
I knew it.

154
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,089
At the last time, it takes fear.

155
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,710
Everyone is due to the life.

156
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,530
I want to take that one!

157
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,800
It was right selfishness?!

158
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,979
You do not like it?

159
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,089
I am sorry.

160
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,009
But…

161
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,909
Species of ungrateful!

162
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,739
Excuse yourself!

163
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,599
Present to Conis-chan
sincere excuses!

164
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,379
Excuse yourself like a man!

165
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,349
Do not pay attention to its selfishness.

166
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,509
I am sorry.

167
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,570
Well…

168
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,480
You can leave it
port by the door number 2.

169
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,200
You will lead to Milky
Road which leads to Upper Yard.

170
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,240
I it is enough for you to follow it.

171
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,340
He, Conis.

172
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,700
Yes?

173
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,040
Why you tremble like that
since one did leave at home?

174
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,869
C this standard…

175
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,350
What does he say?

176
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,010
You find that I tremble?

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,910
Ouais, one would say that you
ace fear of something.

178
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,780
Impossible… It cannot!

179
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,580
Conis-chan! You worry for us!

180
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,580
It is so nice of your share!

181
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,870
But…

182
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,180
Will Ca go for you?

183
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,210
People of the city us
fled like the plague…

184
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,750
But you us ready ton boat…

185
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,060
And you show even the way to us.

186
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,190
Won't one believe
what are you our accomplice?

187
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,599
Your face…

188
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,110
… is very pale.

189
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,540
If you were afraid, one would have
been able to come here by ourselves.

190
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,330
Not…

191
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,970
I…

192
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,300
It is not what you believe!

193
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,190
It does not go…

194
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,150
Do not say anything to them!

195
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,260
It is rather strange…

196
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,839
You to show politely
road towards Ordalies.

197
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,179
You to lead up to now.

198
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,949
While saying to you that them
Ordalies were worse than death.

199
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,140
As if I led you to it.

200
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,849
, STOPPED YOU!

201
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,980
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING STUPID!

202
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,530
It was what that?

203
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,969
It could be…

204
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,410
what are they all in the blow?

205
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,059
But why?

206
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,359
We would not have!

207
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,339
These people-there are different.

208
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,350
Even if they there are not taken along,
they will go nevertheless in Upper Yard!

209
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,649
Yes, I would have liked that it is true.

210
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,670
Ca would have avoided me having with
to make you carry this burden.

211
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,020
But all those which came
previously were similar.

212
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,369
Once their short period
of dissipated excitation…

213
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,960
They start to privilege their lives
rather than their dreams or adventures.

214
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,570
It is for that, that they
must be led over there.

215
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,110
In Upper Yard.

216
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,389
Please,
forgive me, Conis-san!

217
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,089
It is the duty of our people!

218
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,880
It is its will!

219
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,810
Do you want to escape to you well from here?

220
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,080
I am so sorry!

221
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,079
DECREE!

222
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,730
WHAT YOU SAY?!

223
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,769
That which called it
Lobster Super Express train…

224
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,670
… it was me!

225
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,339
The lobster which removed
Nami-san and others?!

226
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,770
You did that, Conis-chan?!

227
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,190
Indeed.

228
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,310
When you were far from the boat…

229
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,680
I lied and I said to them that it there
a driving current at the edge of the Clouds had.

230
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,540
I made them weigh the anchor.

231
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,810
It was the signal so that it
Homard Super Express train arrives.

232
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,039
Small cretin, you want to die?!

233
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,869
It was your duty!

234
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,260
If criminals are met, one is
obliged to lead them to the Earth of the Judgment.

235
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,330
Or if not we are killed!

236
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,149
Keep silent yourself!

237
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,379
You know at least what you say?!

238
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,839
It is a sacrilege towards God!

239
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,629
You of it seize!

240
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,699
It is the duty of our people!

241
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,250
C-C' is not believable!

242
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,970
I am sorry!

243
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,039
It is if embarrassing…

244
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,620
All this!

245
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,390
Idiot!

246
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,590
You did not have the choice, not true?!

247
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,770
Then…

248
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,070
WHY YOU SAID It to US?!

249
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,080
They have some after you, now!

250
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,040
Not! It is too late!

251
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,829
You move away from it!

252
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,340
The Judgment soon will fall!

253
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,160
Pas la pains! They is too large!

254
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,870
It is what this brothel?!

255
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,030
But, what occurred?!

256
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,389
Luffy!

257
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,369
Conis-chan!

258
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,310
He, where are you?!

259
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,190
LUFFY! CONIS!

260
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,099
Ca is not used for nothing.

261
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,310
Very Powerful God
Eneru observes us.

262
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,080
They are all the two safe ones.

263
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,210
It is Gan Fall-san!

264
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,510
This odd Grandfather!

265
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,340
Odd?

266
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,719
I am the Knight of the Sky.

267
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,700
It is a service.

268
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,780
I am so happy, Conis-chan!

269
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,309
I deal with the girl.

270
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,250
Eneru will not be able to attack it with
new as long as it will be with me.

271
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,399
Ouais.

272
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,920
You discovered truths
feelings of this ground.

273
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,799
As well as the capacity of God.

274
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,010
What will you make?

275
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,740
It does not matter what occurs here.

276
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,850
Our companions are on the Island of God.

277
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,010
I see.

278
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,670
How the chance is with you!

279
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,459
What will they become?

280
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,919
They chose the way
that they were to follow.

281
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,060
It is not your fault.

282
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,410
I know who you are.

283
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,510
I am the Knight of the Sky.

284
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,589
Not…

285
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,619
We all know it.

286
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,100
Return us, please…

287
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,340
God.

288
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,429
Everyone on board!

289
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,270
Start when I push!

290
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,910
You come too!

291
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,460
Well, on the way for Upper Yard!

292
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,470
NOOON!

293
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,459
They from go away!

294
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,990
Without the least hesitation!

1
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:17,430
Wow, thanks!

2
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,680
Wow, thanks!

3
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,015
l thought I was a flashy goner there!

4
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,516
l thought I was a flashy goner there!

5
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:22,642
It's no big deal.

6
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,685
It's no big deal.

7
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,646
You're Clown Buggy, aren't you?

8
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,481
How do you know that?

9
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,942
Just who are you?

10
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,528
I'm searching for a certain man...

11
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:34,654
What do you think? Will you cooperate with me?

12
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,071
What do you think? Will you cooperate with me?

13
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:35,447
What do you think? Will you cooperate with me?

14
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,656
What do you think? Will you cooperate with me?

15
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:45,206
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT!
THE RETURN OF CAPTAIN BUGGY!

16
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,588
Where is it that you're headed, Buggy?

17
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,255
WHAT?

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,674
You wanna get rid of me ALREADY?

19
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,583
THAT'S NOT IT!

20
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,097
Well first, I need to find my crew.

21
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,186
Where are they and what are
they doing now, I wonder?

22
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,271
GOMU GOMU NO...

23
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:08,355
GOMU GOMU NO...

24
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,755
BAZOOKA!!

25
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,608
SHIIIIIIT!!

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,486
Dammit! We're in danger!

27
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,447
EVERYONE! Run for your lives

28
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,121
ls everyone here?

29
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,833
If you made it onto the ship, say you're here!

30
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:30,528
I'm here.

31
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,628
I'm here.

32
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:32,928
I'm here.

33
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,028
Here...

34
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,840
Captain Buggy is...

35
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,343
Captain Buggy isn't here!

36
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,229
CAPTAIN BUGGY!

37
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:49,396
CAPTAIN BUGGY!

38
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,319
How long has it been since that day?

39
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,699
Who knows what could've happened
to Captain Buggy...

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,119
We should start thinking about

41
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,705
the future of the Buggy Pirates.

42
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,373
AUUUGH!!

43
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,210
This is obviously all that thief girl Nami's fault!

44
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,212
Roronoa Zoro.

45
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,173
I will take your head off, you fiend!

46
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,716
Zoro. If you always sleep outside on the deck,

47
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:26,716
you're gonna catch a cold you know?

48
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,968
I get battle wounds, but I never get sick.

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,978
Come to think of it...

50
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,314
I never get stuff like headaches, either.

51
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,403
Someone must be talking about
how great a swordsman I am.

52
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,905
I see...

53
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,448
Hey.

54
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,119
Oh, someone must be talking
about me behind my back.

55
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,789
Really... it's hard, being this beautiful.

56
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,208
I wonder who it is that's talking about me?

57
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,644
Captain Buggy...

58
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,274
Before he died...

59
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,736
I thought he was such a cruel and terrible Captain...

60
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,783
But now, I realize what an honorable,
wonderful pirate he was!

61
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,079
Everything we are now, we owe it all to,

62
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,873
Captain Buggy's loving help and example!

63
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:37,962
We will pay our respects to Captain Buggy,
and dedicate this day to his memory!

64
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,259
Captain... Rest in peace...

65
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,721
And from now on, trust your faithful Number 2,

66
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,058
this humble Chief of Staff Cabaji, to lead
the Buggy Pirates in your place.

67
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:50,809
Huh?

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,145
I will rebuild the Buggy Pirates, and
restore them to their former glory.

69
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,939
Wait a minute!

70
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,149
Cabaji!

71
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,025
What is it?

72
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:05,240
I should be leading the Buggy Pirates
after Captain Buggy should be ME!

73
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,703
Vice Captain Beast-Tamer MOHJI-sama!

74
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,537
Heh!

75
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,497
I'm the Captain!

76
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,709
My natural Captain-ish abilities are obvious.

77
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,636
Well, everyone!

78
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,514
This should be decided by a challenge of strength!

79
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,267
I was hoping you'd say that.

80
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,568
Mohji! Mohji! Mohji!

81
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,655
Cabaji! Cabaji! Cabaji!

82
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,615
Mohji! Mohji!

83
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,534
Cabaji! Cabaji!

84
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,212
Shoutogi!

85
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
CABAAAJI!

86
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,216
This will put an end to the matter!

87
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:05,467
This will put an end to the matter!

88
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,260
This will put an end to the matter!

89
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:11,765
Yukemuri, Satsujin Jiken!

90
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,853
DIE!!

91
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,482
MOHJI!!

92
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,859
Bring it on!

93
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,386
I see, so you want to challenge me bare-handed.

94
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,097
Yeah. A man-to-man fight.

95
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,599
I'll finish you with these two fists.

96
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,444
Mohji! Mohji!

97
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,446
Cabaji! Cabaji!

98
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,534
Mohji! Mohji!

99
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:41,771
All right! Get him!

100
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,356
Yeah! Whoo!

101
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:15,430
Ready to quit... I bet, aren't you?

102
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,767
Quit talkin' about yourself!

103
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,813
The one who will be the captain... is MEEEEE!

104
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,565
Shuuuut uuuuup!

105
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,436
Yeah!

106
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,355
Our awesome Cap'n Richie!

107
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,557
CAPTAIN RICHIE!!!

108
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,128
Cap'n Richie! Cap'n Richie!

109
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,130
Our awesome Captain!

110
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,590
After the death of Captain Buggy...

111
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,427
the one who is best suited to
lead us, is Captain Richie!

112
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,171
Cap'n Richie, Cap'n Richie,
Our awesome Captain!

113
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,558
Cap'n Richie, Cap'n Richie

114
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,393
Our awesome Captain!

115
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,896
Cap'n Richie, Cap'n Richie

116
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,856
Our awesome Captain!

117
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,317
Cap'n Richie, Cap'n Richie

118
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:32,942
Our awesome Captain!

119
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,277
Our awesome Captain!

120
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,654
Cap'n Richie, Cap'n Richie

121
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,238
Our awesome Captain!

122
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:37,530
Our awesome Captain!

123
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:37,822
Our awesome Captain!

124
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,698
Our awesome Captain!

125
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,994
Cap'n richie, Cap'n Richie

126
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,253
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

127
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:59,319
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

128
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,912
You there!

129
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:26,996
Who the hell are you?

130
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,163
Who the hell are you?

131
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,917
Who let you onto these shores?

132
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,336
You should know,

133
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,756
that this island belongs to the Kumate Tribe!

134
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,217
Oh! Captain!

135
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,641
Oh? So you're their Captain.

136
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,230
Interesting. Gonna fight?

137
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,230
U-Uncle.

138
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,572
Wha--?

139
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:42,822
Wha--?

140
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,532
HEEEY!

141
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,785
HEEEY!!

142
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,578
What is it?

143
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,540
You don't need to yell so loud...

144
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,336
Did you find something good?

145
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:57,879
Yeah.

146
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:58,963
That's...

147
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,799
That's my great...

148
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,553
Grand Flashy Flagship of the Buggy Pirates!

149
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,432
What is this?

150
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,934
This big grave?

151
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,394
W-What?

152
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,853
Did you say, big nose?

153
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,106
Who's got a big nose?

154
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,566
ME?

155
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,193
The grave! The grave!

156
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,278
RED? YOU SAY IT'S RED TOO?

157
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,408
You think my nose is big AND red!?

158
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,159
Wait, this is my grave?

159
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,830
You're so slow.

160
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,542
But who would have done this?

161
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,835
It's such bad luck.

162
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,339
And they used such an old picture of me...

163
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,759
Huh? There's someone lying
on the ground over there.

164
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,387
WHAAAA?

165
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,889
Mohji! Cabaji!

166
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,558
What the hell happened to you?

167
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,603
Oh... oh, Captain Buggy...

168
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,188
Oh...

169
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,399
How I've longed for this moment...

170
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,486
You survived!

171
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,239
I'm so happy to see you again!

172
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,616
I'm so happy too!

173
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,286
But...

174
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,664
What the hell is going on here?

175
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,791
Who did this?

176
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,084
Oh...

177
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,546
I was beaten up all of a sudden...

178
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,757
It's strange, but...

179
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,884
I really can't remember a thing!

180
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,887
I think the ones who did this...

181
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,555
must have been the Kumate Tribe.

182
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,516
Kumate Tribe?

183
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:34,726
Yeah...

184
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,771
If you want to save them, you'd better hurry.

185
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,567
The Kumate Tribe are famous for having
a very special taste in food...

186
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,918
Captain says that lion meat is not very tasty to eat!

187
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,795
And neither are we!

188
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,588
I'm sooo not delicious!!

189
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,048
He's got better flavor than me!

190
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:08,051
No, no, he's lying! He tastes much better than I do!

191
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,929
I-I-I'm far too skinny!

192
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,560
It's okay! The Kumate's are excellent cooks.

193
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,480
We'll just add some wine and
marinate for a great flavor!

194
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,903
What should we do about these ingredients?

195
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,530
What is it?

196
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,990
I've never seen such ingredients before.

197
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,450
Shall we all try some?

198
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,328
I hope it's still fresh.

199
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,321
BARA BARA BARA

200
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,702
BARA BARA BARA BARA

201
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,494

206
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,632
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys!

207
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,428
Show them the Buggy Bombs, and make it flashy!

208
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,476
Go-go-go-go!

209
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,439
Richie!

210
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,618
Shoutogi, Yukemuri, Satsujin Jiken!

211
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,163
Here comes the animal show!

212
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:54,050
You thought you could take on the
Great Buggy-sama did you?

213
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,016
I need to thank you for watching
over my crew for me.

214
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,476
HERE I GO WITH FLASH!!

215
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:05,603

221
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:13,820
BARA BARA PUNCH!

222
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,070
BARA BARA PUNCH!

223
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,280

227
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,249
BARA BARA FESTIVAL!

00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:26,291

All for us...!

232
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,218
Our Captain is...!

233
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,393
CAPTAIN BUGGY!

234
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,440
We're so blessed to see you alive!

235
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,695
I'm so sorry for troubling you, my dear men.

236
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,449
Oh please don't worry about us!

237
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,662
Yaaaaah!

238
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,623
Who are you calling a freak?

239
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,333
Ooohhh!

240
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,004
We've been through such difficulties...

241
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,882
All because of that shitty Straw Hat guy!

242
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:20,762
By the way...

243
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,431
Who is this lovely young lady?

244
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,226
She's sooo cute!

245
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,771
Oh yes, I was curious, too.

246
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,609
This is the wonderful person
who saved my great life!

247
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,068
Uh...

248
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,403
This...

249
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,614
Um, excuse me...

250
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,158
May I have your name, please?

251
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,165
Alright, guys! The Buggy Pirates have returned!

252
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:52,752
Captain!

253
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,796
What are we after now?

254
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,842
MONKEY D. LUFFY'S... HEAD!

255
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:04,472
YEAHHHH!!

256
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,830
Hey, I can kinda make out an island.

257
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,915
Eh? Really?

258
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,002
What island is that?

259
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,005
Didn't we go over that already?

260
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,014
Ah?

261
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,633
So that's the island where Loguetown is.

262
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,637
It's a pretty big city.

263
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,806
Yes, I've heard that, too.

264
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:51,519
They should have lots of good
places to get fresh food.

265
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,688
I need to go to a weapon store.

266
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:59,027
San tou ryu with only one sword just won't work.

267
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,739
Yeah, I wanna check it out, too.

268
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,035
On that island, Gold Roger was born...

269
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,913
and also executed.

270
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,584
Oh? So you do remember.

271
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,588
The city where the Pirate King died.

272
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,258
A place called, ''The Town of
the Beginning and the End''.

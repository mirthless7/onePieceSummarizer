1
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,440
GOMU GOMU NO…

2
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,470
HANABI!
[Hanabi:Fireworks]

3
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,849
White Berets…

4
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,270
They beat them.

5
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,280
The insane poor!

6
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,600
You should have listened to me
well nicely!

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,999
White Berets…

8
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,310
are the nicest guards
and understanding of the Divine Earth.

9
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,330
But “them”… They
will not be so lenient!

10
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,080
You are now
criminals of Class 2!

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,380
You will beg in vain…

12
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,200
Priests of Upper Yard…

13
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,629
… will regulate your fate!

14
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,729
Heso!

15
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:01,780
One can séchapper?!
Ordalies of God start!

16
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,590
It is what their problem?!

17
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,510
There is more serious…

18
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,300
We are condemned!

19
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,839
Did this old woman say it, not true?

20
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,010
“You can pass.”

21
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,619
Now that we are here one
we regards as the clandestine ones?!

22
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,939
What a swindles!

23
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,190
I would flank a beating well to him!

24
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,389
You said it!

25
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,560
In any event one would have come
even if it had prevented us.

26
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,519
Closes it to you!

27
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,739
Despite everything, this situation
is really embarrassing.

28
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,420
Now that you are
criminals of Class 2, us…

29
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,809
… let us not can help you!

30
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,449
Why you speak about also far?!

31
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,150
Bah, that done anything!

32
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,800
One with the practice to be required.

33
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,059
By the way…

34
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,030
Why returned to you?

35
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
Hein?

36
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,510
One left for an great adventure there
where one should never put the feet…

37
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,800
Not, I want to say… to seek you!

38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,230
Be really too foreseeable for you.

39
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,269
WHAT A great adventure?!

40
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,350
You did not listen to me?!

41
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,399
There are only the rough ones
bloodthirsty men on this island!

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,289
You did not see them then
do not make the malignant one!

43
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,699
I do not know if it were God or not,

44
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,469
But this horrible capacity
and without limits was real!

45
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,089
I will not go back there!

46
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,530
Not on this island!

47
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,020
From agreement, one goes there,
you ace that to wait here.

48
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,229
Not! They will pursue me!

49
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,919
One draws from here!

50
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,699
One draws?! Not average!

51
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,509
What is more
important, the adventure or your life?!

52
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,549
MY LIFE!

53
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,570
And then money!

54
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,689
And then it is me?

55
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,620
The farm!

56
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,629
Wait, with the fact!

57
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,960
One was so in a hurry
to reach the celestial island…

58
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,130
that one ever wondered
how to go down again.

59
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,990
Said, there is one
sure means to return?

60
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,400
Can we turn over
on the Blue Sea?

61
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,920
Considering your current location, I cannot
not really to say that it is sure, but…

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,239
There exists a means.

63
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,060
Appointment at the end of the cloud,
until reaching the “edge of the Clouds”.

64
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,959
The “edge of the clouds”?

65
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,690
How one goes there?

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,189
The “edge of the clouds” is
completely in the East of the cloud.

67
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,440
To go there, you will have initially
to go down on the White Sea.

68
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,410
Very well! Then one can return on
is our sea in this way, it well that?

69
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,700
Not! I do not return.

70
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,189
He, you want to remain here
and to make you carry out?

71
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,380
In any case, you would do nothing but attract
problems with Conis and his/her father!

72
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,789
Oh, it does not obstruct us…

73
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,370
Lastly, even if one fled, perhaps
that one will not escape these guy.

74
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,329
If it is the case, where that one
goes, it will be similar.

75
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,499
They know where we are,
thus one must quickly move from here.

76
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,440
Go the guy! The veils are raised!

77
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,159
Yes…

78
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,450
Conis, Oji-san, thank you for all!

79
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,709
Ah, ouais!

80
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,559
Wait, Luffy!

81
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,290
He, Papi!

82
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,979
That there
does it have?

83
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,070
One can take with us
remains it puffs out?

84
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,569
Yes, of course, go ahead!

85
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,589
Super!

86
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,100
Sanji, prepares to us that!

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,299
You leashes nothing to pass you.

88
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,160
In this case, me also I have
a favor to be asked you.

89
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,269
Grandfather, you are
engineer, not true?

90
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,340
I can take to you some
materials to repair our boat?

91
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,939
Yes, without problem.

92
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,849
They are at the house.

93
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,420
He! Where you like that go?!

94
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,889
I will seek puffs out!

95
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,600
You them guy, prepare
the boat for the adventure!

96
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,550
It wants to go always there!

97
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,529
They is very dangerous over there!

98
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,719
And then?

99
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,200
Me that is equal for me!

100
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,220
Pas la pains of you
to pass the nerves on me!

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Chopper!

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,070
You are on my side, not true?

103
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,100
Does not threaten it!

104
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,820
Heavy Not!

105
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,359
I was on the point
to install the scale.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,100
Oups.

107
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,290
You do not include/understand? You
donot can convince Luffy.

108
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,159
Even if everyone there
puts, it will not listen.

109
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,999
Very well.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,470
Then I remain here!

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,150
Ouais, make as you want.

112
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,889
“Make as you want”?!

113
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,860
I will be made kill by these nuts!

114
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,420
Well, make as you want then.

115
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,610
Why you…

116
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,380
Robin?

117
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,019
Could you help me to strike Luffy?

118
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,000
It is impossible.

119
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,480
I imagine that one will have to get rid
our prosecutors one by one.

120
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,520
These White Berets must surely seek
men to continue us again.

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,539
You to continue? Ridiculous.

122
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,539
God and his priests are too
immutable that a mountain.

123
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,709
They wait to judge the imprudent ones which
dare to come to defy them on the crowned ground.

124
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,709
When they are in anger,
Ordalies start!

125
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,420
You will be automatically lead…

126
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,730
towards the prohibited crowned ground!

127
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,630
Upper Yard!

128
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,560
Excuse me, I have
something to say to you.

129
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,800
There exists current cloudy special
to turn over on the White Sea?

130
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,819
Yes, by taking it, you
will be able to cross quickly…

131
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,329
this part of the sea for
you to return to the White Sea.

132
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,140
After that, you will reach the “edge
clouds " without any problem.

133
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,170
Really?

134
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,050
If you manage to take this current, it is
not very probable that somebody is able to follow you.

135
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,370
It is enough nothing to say to Luffy and of
to guide the Vogue-Merry towards this current!

136
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,760
Time that it realizes,
it will be too late, hein?

137
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,580
Then, knowledge if it will give up
or not, it is another history.

138
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,650
I can lead you to the point
of entry by using our Waver.

139
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,890
Well, it is necessary to arrive over there
before this idiot does not include/understand.

140
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,639
I can manage for that.

141
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,180
Well in this case, weigh the anchor
and please await me here.

142
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,370
Of agreement!

143
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,210
We are indebted for you, Conis!

144
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,870
Oh, it is nothing…

145
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,589
They is delicious!

146
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,210
He, stops puffing out our provisions!

147
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,769
There is full!

148
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,970
You can eat some too!

149
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,980
Be to you all eating!

150
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,349
Conis! Papi!

151
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,839
Do it
yourself!

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,260
Hein? Conis-chan left.

153
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,170
She says goodbye to everyone.

154
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,110
Here is your tea.

155
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,300
You are the carpenter of the ship?

156
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,309
Not, at all.

157
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,699
I am the gunner.

158
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,059
Oh, it is even more impressive!

159
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,820
Ouais, we do not have yet
of carpenter in the crew.

160
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,869
But it is not a problem!

161
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,980
Ca means that they must count on my
All-powerful Skill in all to repair!

162
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,809
What a responsibility!

163
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,410
Without me, this boat
would not make failure.

164
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,320
Even as a gunner, it is
almost me which plays the part of Captain.

165
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,449
It is besides for that
everyone calls me…

166
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,710
CAPTAIN… USOPP!

167
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,909
Oh, but this decoration is
true a oeuvre d'art!

168
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,210
Hein?

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,359
Exactly!

170
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,400
It is an art to present a meal!

171
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,160
Goodbye, Conis!

172
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,590
Heso!

173
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,999
One has finally a glimmer of hope!

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,869
With all that is
passed, I believed in it more!

175
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,890
But, this current
does there really exist?

176
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,050
Hein?

177
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,519
If there existed really one
so practical current…

178
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,070
it would be easy to meet
survivors of the celestial island on the Blue Sea.

179
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,219
Bah, let us go!

180
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,630
It was said to us that very few people
arrived up to now of the first blow.

181
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,180
Of course, rare are
those which escape.

182
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,950
And perhaps that the majority of them were not enough fast to escape their attackers.

183
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,330
It rightly. If one does not leave
in time, one ends up being killed.

184
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,939
Dispatch we to hoist the veils!

185
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,390
Weigh the anchor!

186
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,250
Chopper, uses this Heavy
Ball and deals with that!

187
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,029
Ca is called Heavy Point…

188
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,719
WHAT?!

189
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,819
Not nothing…

190
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,929
And Zoro awakes!

191
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,829
It is impossible.

192
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,739
Not engraves. I will arrive there!

193
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,230
If one does not make quickly, one
would misuse the kindness of Conis.

194
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,070
Heavy Not!

195
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,269
Just here…

196
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,869
Not, that does not go…

197
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,469
I will leave it there red…

198
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,610
And to place green emerald here…

199
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,270
Cool. Ca gives well!

200
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,019
Those will be for
Nami-san and Robin-chwan.

201
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,140
Ah, one would say almost that it
is not food!

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,099
Not, not. I excuse myself. I
would not have, really…

203
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,140
Ah yes?

204
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
This one is for
you, Conis-chan!

205
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,970
You made some for me too?

206
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,919
But of course!

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,719
I decided to entitle this meal…

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,739
“The Love is Ordalie, it
Meal of a Downward Angel ".

209
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,719
Oh!

210
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,080
Bah, that has anything of
special when it is eaten.

211
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,110
Would be a little more polished!

212
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,529
Listen, food must front
all to have the air delicious!

213
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,590
Good Ah?

214
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,219
Look at, it is similar!

215
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,130
You ate it without same looking at it!

216
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,229
Good Ah?

217
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,469
Perfect.

218
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,319
Ouais, always similar.

219
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,119
Always same taste.

220
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,519
You must initially enjoy with your eyes!

221
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,319
One of fout.

222
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,479
You cannot eat with your eyes, if?

223
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,189
I did not say that!

224
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,079
Perhaps that I can
to eat by the nose…

225
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,529
DO NOT EAT LIKE CA!

226
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,750
Oh, so much worse.

227
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,300
As soon as Luffy and them
others are of return…

228
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,390
Perfect!

229
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,640
Perfect!

230
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Chopper!

231
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,840
What occurred?!

232
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,880
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

233
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,880
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

234
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,260
It is what this brothel?!

235
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,760
Perhaps that one is
already on this current!

236
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
He!

237
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,739
There is a problem with the boat!

238
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,730
What?!

239
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,999
That there is,
Usopp?

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,899
Look at over there!

241
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,479
It would be said that they howl!

242
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,560
They have fun the festival?

243
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,790
Not cool, they have fun without us!

244
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,050
Nami-san!

245
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,389
Why…

246
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,830
Why it
wear a Tee-shirt?!

247
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,650
It is all that worries you, stunned?!

248
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,440
The boat from goes away!

249
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,420
But why?!

250
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,530
What they make?!

251
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,290
Where they go?!

252
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,589
It sail with move back!

253
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,999
They is super!

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
Not! They do not sail!

255
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,800
Look under the boat!

256
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,759
Wait one minute…
What occurs here?

257
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,410
It is what that?!

258
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,879
Was the current taken?

259
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
Not, it would be said that it
acts of another thing.

260
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,550
C-C' is what that?!

261
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,320
It is…

262
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,269
A single species of the Sea of Opal!

263
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,230
The Lobster Super Express train!

264
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,490
What?!

265
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,549
Where it takes us along?!

266
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,249
He, everyone evacuates the ship!

267
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,509
It is not yet too late!

268
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,059
And the boat then?!

269
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,030
If it takes the boat…

270
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,769
Do not make any you!

271
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,829
I remain on board!

272
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,069
You cannot…

273
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,349
What hope you to make all alone?!

274
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,130
I will find a means!

275
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,440
Ca does not go…

276
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,870
Y' has result.

277
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,640
Ok, that will go.

278
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,830
Unfortunately, I
believe that it is useless.

279
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,760
Go back to edge!

280
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,650
What?

281
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,220
Even if you succeeded, there are
others which will come by behind.

282
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,880
Look at!

283
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,970
What?

284
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,239
Enormous celestial monsters.

285
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,040
They sink on us
open large mouth.

286
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,770
One will not be able to return
with the stroke without danger.

287
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,739
And even if one succeeded
to get rid some…

288
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,519
There is probably
others which wait.

289
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,509
Any fight of our share will be vain.

290
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,310
It is undoubtedly the beginning.

291
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,149
The judgment celestial, not true?

292
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,360
Instead of coming to seek us,
one delivers to us on a plate.

293
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,140
Crafty ones, dumbs!

294
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,240
Then… one takes us along on this island?

295
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,379
LUFFY!

296
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,179
USOPP!

297
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,100
SANJI-KUN!

298
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,239
Why?

299
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,669
Why a Tee-shirt?

300
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,370
You always speak about that you?!

301
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,309
He, Luffy, that fear!

302
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,160
And now?! What does one make?

303
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,260
They left where?

304
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,570
Where?! Is it really…

305
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,040
Where?

306
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,159
Where

307
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,699
Where they are

308
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,400
Where are parties?

309
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,370
The Lobster Super Express train
is a servant of God.

310
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,690
All that it transports
is used as offering.

311
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,220
If it is well the case…

312
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,599
Their destination is thus
the North-East of Upper Yard…

313
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,990
Towards the Sacrificial Furnace bridge.

314
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,929
Sacrificial?!

315
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,079
Nami-san, Robin-chan
and these types?!

316
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,819
These types?!

317
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,730
They will be sacrificed?!

318
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,700
This dirty God…

319
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,619
This dumb…

320
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,889
You want to rub with me?!

321
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,699
Salt son of…

322
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,080
Wait please!

323
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,569
I am sorry!

324
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,860
It is not what you believe!

325
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,359
What?

326
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,920
I intended to say that those
who will be sacrificed…

327
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,300
… receive one of both
forms of the Celestial Judgment.

328
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,799
The sacrifice, or Ordalies.

329
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,879
They are so to speak
between the hands of God.

330
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,740
Prisoners with destination
sacrificial Furnace bridge!

331
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,300
Hostages?

332
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,900
Consequently, those which
are judged in this moment…

333
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,950
… it is you here three.

334
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,240
Hein? What does that want to say?

335
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,840
If I had a chart on me…

336
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,360
If you need one
chart of Skypiea, I have one of them.

337
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,089
It does not go back to yesterday.

338
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,950
But the topology of
islands seems to me correct.

339
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,010
Is all well, Conis-chan?

340
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,059
Yes.

341
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,959
But…

342
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,570
Do not worry you!

343
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,189
I know them well!

344
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,710
All will be well!

345
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,710
Assertion without bases.

346
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,899
We are here.

347
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,980
The Sacrificial Furnace bridge is in
high on the left, in the North-East.

348
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,290
And it is possible only one to go there.

349
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,060
You must take Milky
Road starting from this island…

350
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:46,800
… and to use a boat with Dial for
to cross the forest where the Priests reside.

351
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,450
Not, wait, Grand-père!

352
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,700
One could not simply take
a boat and to make the turn of the island?

353
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,870
It is like that this lobster
went in Upper Yard, not?

354
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,770
Not, even if you accost
in the neighborhoods,

355
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,970
you will be able to never reach
the Furnace bridge of the Sacrifices to foot.

356
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,290
Something changed between this
chart and Upper Yard of today…

357
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,290
it is Milky Road which
fly over the very whole island.

358
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,209
This river of clouds?

359
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,839
Yes.

360
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,010
I intended to say that Milky Road
count several hundreds of affluents.

361
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:40,090
And thus, the only means of going over there is to sail to the heart of the island while following Milky Road.

362
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,730
I see.

363
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,910
Some is the place where one accosts,
we will be blocked by this river.

364
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,270
Yes…

365
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,070
And this river is populated
fish man-eaters.

366
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,989
Fish man-eaters?!

367
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,270
What a kindness!

368
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,790
In any case, if one wants to find
our companions and our boat…

369
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,940
It is necessary to pass by the main door.

370
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,139
Here thus Ordalie
that one must undergo…

371
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,570
The Celestial Judgment?

372
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,170
Yes, you must face the power
unimaginable of the four Priests of Upper Yard.

373
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,389
What? Then it is all considering.

374
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,180
To make short… Botter is owed
is the bottom as of these Priests, it that?

375
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,100
You take that with light like always.

376
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,240
The things become interesting.

1
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:56,299
At the time of the final combat of Davy Back Fight,

2
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,566
Mugiwara Dangers gained an unhoped-for victory!

3
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,766
My… Noro Noro Beam was used for nothing…

4
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,566
Super! Super! Super!

5
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,300
It is brilliant…

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Really brilliant…

7
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,232
All's well that ends well.

8
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,100
Ouais.

9
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,099
And now, the so much awaited decision…

10
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,365
Who thus will Luffy choose?

11
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,633
Chopper! Return!

12
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,633
Iyan… Choppy!

13
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:33,499
Thank you…

14
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,833
I am so happy…

15
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:39,566
Do not cry. One could not lose.

16
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:40,965
Well well…

17
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,965
In this Davy Back Fight full with tears and sweat…

18
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,765
The pirates of the straw hat succeeded
to recover their Chopper fellow-member!

19
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,765
The tournament shows a tie!

20
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:53,366
Wait, wait, wait!

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,232
In the world of the pirates, a tie that does not exist!

22
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,900
There are only the victory or the defeat,
not true straw hat?

23
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,033
What do you want to say?

24
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:14,100
And if one formed another part of the Three-Corner Range?

25
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,232
It is stupid or what?

26
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:19,700
Why one would still play his rotted play?

27
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,300
It… It… It has… It accepted!

28
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,366
It is what I wanted!

29
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:36,233
Idiot! Cretin! Weak!

30
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:41,166
It will be the last time, I promise it to you!

31
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,966
One must still fight?

32
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,765
There are not the choice, since it accepted the combat.

33
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:51,166
It perhaps had an idea.

34
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,500
It would be well the first time.

35
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,633
Perhaps that he seeks to enlist a naval engineer.

36
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:04,650
HOWLING SERVICE!
THE BALL WITH THE PIRATE PRISONER!

37
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,165
A new Three-Corner Range will be played.

38
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,832
Comprising a play of ball where all
the members can take part!

39
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,432
This play must count six players in each camp

40
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,765
You will have to fight face to face.

41
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:18,966
A player cannot take part any more
twice with the tests.

42
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,700
To change the composition of the teams is prohibited.

43
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,565
This time they will take to me, it is sure.

44
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,765
Not, it is me whom they will take.

45
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,100
They made ego an idol.

46
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,099
These deux-là is not wanted.

47
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,099
He… Why?

48
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,433
Too much soft, and too alarming.

49
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,499
Well, the first test…

50
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,365
“Hit and Deadball”.

51
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,766
As usual, I state you the rules.

52
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,965
Two balls will be concerned.

53
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:47,766
You will use these balls for touching
the adversaries which will be on the ground.

54
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,766
All those which will be touched will be eliminated.

55
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,366
They will not be able to thus return any more on the ground.

56
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:57,033
You lose the part when all your
players on the ground were touched.

57
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,099
You choose your players of
ground or of out-field freely.

58
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,965
But, a player of out-field does not have the right…

59
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,765
to enter on the ground,

60
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,366
even if it touched many people.

61
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,766
I see…

62
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,500
It is a little like the ball with the prisoner…

63
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:15,900
For more details, read the payment carefully.

64
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,699
The payment?

65
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,900
Which large book…

66
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,165
Exact, Hit and Deadball…

67
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:28,433
is the play more regulated Davy Back Fight.

68
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,699
In the course of time, its rules changed gradually,

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,700
to create a play with the very strict laws.

70
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:38,900
That is not used for only they are
strict if you do not respect them!

71
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:41,832
You arbitrate as that arranges you in any event.

72
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,365
Not, not, not… Look at the first page well.

73
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,033
Arbitration regulations…

74
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:50,232
Go against this payment and…

75
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,632
you will be decapitated.

76
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,565
Decapitated?!

77
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:53,633
What a horror!

78
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,300
Indeed.

79
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:59,765
Moreover, our arbitration body has
more than 50 years of experience

80
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:03,100
With the four assistants, they are five referees in all.

81
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:07,500
It would be said that one will have a honest combat.

82
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,299
The crew of Foxy has just aligned his team!

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,233
What a seen splendid!

84
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:19,966
Compared with them, the small faiblarde team
straw hat seems handicapped.

85
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:22,365
As always they are only Sept.

86
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,766
Useless to point out it!

87
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,632
The moment came.

88
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,500
The setting concerned will be done by a double interval.

89
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,500
That two players of each team advance!

90
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,166
Zoro, I want to do it!

91
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,633
I count on you.

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,433
Jump of all your forces!

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,965
Oooh! The doctor changed appearance!

94
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,299
It seems that he has superhuman capacities…

95
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,165
It should not be taken with the light one!

96
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,099
Iyan… It is what that?!

97
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,166
It does not have anything any more nice!

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,966
How the part starts!

99
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,300
One had them! Go, shootez them!

100
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,699
One goes there!

101
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,833
Chopper!

102
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,233
Aim head of puzzle!

103
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,166
Oyabin attention!

104
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,366
Is Oh, it already eliminated!?

105
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,032
Shyaaa! One beat Oyabin!

106
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,499
It is except, except!

107
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,566
What!? The shooting was perfect!

108
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,166
Article 20…

109
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,700
“The face does not count!”

110
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,166
What?!

111
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:52,633
Shit!

112
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,633
You are well, Oyabin?

113
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:58,433
Do not laugh, Hamburger-san!

114
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,166
It is our chance.

115
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,166
Touch the most possible world.

116
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,100
Of agreement!

117
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,633
I will touch them all! We will gain all!

118
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:13,166
You all, dispatch you to flee!

119
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:24,366
… Do not draw too extremely…

120
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,232
Equip with Foxy…

121
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:43,033
Eighteen players in less!

122
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,032
Super!

123
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:49,366
Incredible, they touched each one nine players of a blow!

124
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,500
Even score, hein?

125
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:54,566
Sanji cheer, Zoro cheer!

126
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,233
Excuse me…

127
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,833
Fantastic, nine of a blow.

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,833
Yosh, in my turn!

129
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:19,965
Equip with Foxy…

130
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,700
Ten players in less!

131
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,433
Ten players, record to be beaten!

132
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,832
Wah! Still a skewer of eliminated players!

133
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,433
The team of Foxy is finally in possession of the ball.

134
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:33,832
This time, it is my turn!

135
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,899
Go Chopper! Be given to bottom!

136
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,366
Yosh, I included/understood!

137
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:58,166
Ooooh! Hamburger succeeded in saving to them his!

138
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,632
Now, the team of Foxy has two balls!

139
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,633
It is the hour of the counter-attack.

140
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,633
Played well, Hamburger.

141
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,766
Give the ball to Big Bang.

142
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,500
Go ahead Big Bang!

143
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,166
Align to them all!

144
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,966
If it touches me, I died… I will die!

145
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,966
Ah not!

146
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,966
Oh, it is…

147
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,633
Length-nose and twenty-two players of the team of Foxy…

148
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,433
are eliminated!

149
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,500
Are Usopp, you well?

150
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,966
I succeeded in with me leaving there alive…

151
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,966
And guesses which with the ball?

152
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:06,299
By boxing the attack of Big Bang,

153
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,100
Usopp carried many other players with him!

154
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,567
There remain nothing any more but two adversaries.

155
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:17,633
Many people were made beat.

156
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,433
That is badly.

157
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,900
How will they be left there?

158
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,133
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

159
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:39,467
MUGIWARA-TEAM

160
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,666
Does Oyabin, what one make?

161
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,999
Does what one make?

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,733
As long as the historian is there,
I cannot use my Noro Noro Beam.

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,400
It is time to use it!

164
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,533
Really? “It”?

165
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:00,467
Completely. “It”.

166
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,933
Oh there there! Hamburger has been just made touch!

167
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,467
Played well, Robin!

168
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,867
The head does not count!

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,267
If, it is specified that the head counts…
page 103, subparagraph 54.

170
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,933
It rightly.

171
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,132
Does not obstruct us more!

172
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,066
You want to be made decapitate?!

173
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,200
I am sorry…

174
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,332
What a control, this Robin!

175
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:37,000
It thus succeeded in memorizing
all the payment in if little time?

176
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,267
Impressing, Robin!

177
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,467
But I yet very did not read.

178
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,399
Yosh, it remains nothing any more but one about it.

179
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,667
Sanji-kun, draws to him above!

180
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,933
Well, Nami-san!

181
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,200
San ji-kuun…

182
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,467
Do not draw…

183
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,399
Give us this ball!

184
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,933
Here it is!

185
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,732
Thank you.

186
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,199
You me leashes to touch you with?

187
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,067
My small rolled up eyebrow.

188
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:12,867
Touch me, strike, done me what you want!

189
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,267
But what you insane, Sanji-kun!?

190
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,267
Oooh! Sanji the womanizer
was passionately made burst the head!

191
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,333
It is the second elimination for
the team of the straw hat!

192
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,600
Cretin of mellorine!

193
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,999
He is without hope.

194
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,067
But in any event, there remains nothing any more but Oyabin.

195
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:44,000
One did not gain yet, it can always overcome us.

196
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,067
Indeed!

197
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,400
It is what that?

198
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:57,000
It will use the weapon Multi Item of Hit and Deadball!

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,400
Operation…

200
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,400
gun “Sight of Elite”!

201
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:09,267
He the referee, that goes completely against the rules!

202
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,133
It is thus that the Sight of Elite.

203
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,667
Do not say to me that you ace already heard of this trick?

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,533
They spoke about it in the payment,
but I was unaware of that it was that.

205
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,066
Exact, in accordance with article 322,

206
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,467
the Sight of Elite is the only authorized weapon.

207
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,800
It is true this lie?

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,799
Too much cool!

209
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,999
I want the same one.

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,466
It is merdic!

211
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:34,267
He, that is used for nothing your trick,
you nevertheless will lose!

212
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,867
Ah yes?

213
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,532
Is porch, all ready?

214
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes, Oyabin.

215
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,000
It left!

216
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:46,999
Shit!

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,133
It is soporific, close the eyes!

218
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,666
It still uses this perfume.

219
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,132
It is the moment, Oyabin!

220
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,467
Received.

221
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,933
Revenge!

222
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,333
That the eyes are closed or not…

223
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:10,067
does not have importance for a true swashbuckler.

224
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,199
Extraordinary! Incredible!

225
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,267
The epeist Zoro sliced the ball into two,
with naked hands and closed eyes!

226
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,599
Iyan!

227
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,699
Zoro of the team of the straw hat… expelled!

228
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,333
Why!?

229
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,933
Article 645…

230
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,400
“It is interdict to destroy the ball!”

231
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,867
New ball for the team of Foxy.

232
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,467
What?!

233
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,333
As it is damage.

234
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,199
Ah, which damage.

235
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,799
Zoro the swashbuckler is eliminated!

236
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Zoro is…

237
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,667
fact of excluding from the play.

238
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,932
Epeist of shit!

239
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,333
You were made eliminate before me, the cook.

240
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,932
That starts to become interesting.

241
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:58,133
It is of both against one.

242
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,600
Attention here me is!

243
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,067
Try to touch me!

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Me too.

245
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:13,067
Super high-speed, level five.

246
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:16,000
Try to avoid that.

247
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,000
Iyan, Choppy!

248
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,599
Chopper was sacrificed to make this splendid stop.

249
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,932
How is it?

250
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,000
Doesn't the face count, hein?

251
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,732
VI… Face?

252
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:49,132
It… It was touched with the face?

253
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,267
It is very difficult to say.

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,999
It is too hairy.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,399
Referee!

256
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,066
You are a sailor, not true?

257
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,532
The ball touched its face!

258
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:02,200
If you do not recognize his courage to him,
more the sorrow to claim you marine!

259
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:07,932
That does not count! That does not count!
That does not count! That does not count!

260
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:08,599
What?

261
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,400
That does not count! That does not count!
That does not count! That does not count!

262
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,532
More to claim me marine?

263
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,532
I cannot let them say that!

264
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,733
The decision is essential itself…
That does not count!

265
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,067
But!

266
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:28,866
But?!

267
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:33,467
Even if the face does not count,
you left the limits of the ground!

268
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,333
Oh not, it is outside, unfortunately!

269
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,266
This small catch in the so large heart…

270
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,732
Chopper is unfortunately eliminated!

271
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,400
But you are inevitably a large sailor!

272
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,667
Choppy!

273
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,133
You are well, Chopper?

274
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,733
Yes but…

275
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,867
I am eliminated…

276
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,267
Let to me occupy itself some!

277
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,067
Thank you, I owe you that, Chopper well.

278
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,599
Do not say that to me…

279
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,067
That does not give me pleasure of the whole!

280
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:17,200
Be really good for you, Choppy!
Now, I want you more than ever!

281
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,067
I will not leave myself it!

282
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,799
Maintaining it is against one.

283
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,599
There remains nobody any more other.

284
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,067
It is final confrontation!

285
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,000
I will not want you,
simply, dispatch you to lose!

286
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,667
No matter what it arrives, I will not lose!

287
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:39,267
But what do you tell?

288
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:42,267
Look around you before saying
a trick which you will regret.

289
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,399
Here it is finally!

290
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,733
Swing-low of combat!

291
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,533
Prepare!

292
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,332
It is what that!?

293
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,732
He the referee, made something!

294
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,199
There are too many balls!

295
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,467
There is no rule prohibiting the use of twenty balls.

296
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:01,933
I knew well that were to you with the team with Foxy…

297
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,666
Fact of shitting! We will be always disadvantaged,
unless having our own referee.

298
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,266
Do not worry you Luffy!

299
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:10,533
Only you and Oyabin have the two good balls.

300
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,132
The others do not count!

301
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,800
Oh, it is true!

302
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,533
What does it have that?
It has the brain in puzzle, too?

303
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,400
The brain in puzzle…

304
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,200
I see, then I will smash you you and your funny head.

305
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,200
Here me is!

306
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,733
Iyan, by here!

307
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,733
You ace too stretched your arm…

308
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,699
How everyone mixes!

309
00:19:52,700 --> 00:20:03,933
One mixes! One mixes! One mixes!

310
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,666
Oh not!

311
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,933
One does not know what a any more ball is the good one!

312
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:14,000
One mixes! One mixes! One mixes!

313
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,499
Then, which is the good one?

314
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,999
If you discover it after it
touched you, it will be too late!

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,532
The farm! I have only to catch up with all the balls!

316
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,667
What a arrogance!

317
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,467
I did not believe so bad player.

318
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,867
The guy, draw!

319
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
And now, the final blow…

320
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,000
Luffy, attention!

321
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,532
Luffy, take it in full face!

322
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,400
You are really démoniaque!

323
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,067
Excel!

324
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,667
Super!

325
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,933
Luffy with the straw hat… expelled!

326
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,533
But why!? The face does not count!

327
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:27,067
Article 999.
“It is interdict to swallow the ball.”

328
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,100
It is written in the black payment on white.

329
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,532
It is exact.

330
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,733
It is written in the last page.

331
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,867
Impossible… that exists, a similar rule?

332
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,066
And the winner of Hit and Deadball is…

333
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,600
The crew of Foxy!!

334
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,933
Idiot!!

1
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:31,290
When the Authority of the kingdom falls!

2
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:31,290
The flag of the will perdure for eternity

3
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,810
Where did it pass?

4
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,680
Who?

5
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,630
He!

6
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,670
He?

7
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,210
This person who is damned guy with the steel teeth!

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,960
What a jerk!

9
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,500
When I find it, I will regulate his account to him!

10
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,250
But what occurred here?

11
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,260
What did it make with my splendid castle?

12
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,940
Doctorine…

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,740
This guy, it said that I was…

14
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,540
his/her companion.

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,710
It is not the moment to remain with the bed.

16
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,770
I must eclipse before the return of Doctorine.

17
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,870
I have chance! The way is free.

18
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,760
Qu Which is?

19
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,520
Thus hold, you would not be a team member of Straw hat, by chance?

20
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,050
Its head does not inspire confidence to me.

21
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,720
Not, you make error.

22
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,360
I do not know at all what you speak.

23
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,230
What? It is an error?!

24
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,320
Really?

25
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,870
Completely! I am only one navigatrice of passage.

26
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,250
I see.

27
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,890
Good, I must go there now…

28
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,450
Of agreement!

29
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,140
LIAR!

30
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,840
Remain, small stupid there!

31
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,120
Does not approach you! Go away!

32
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,070
Would I have taken a little belly?

33
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,570
I know what it remains to me to do!

34
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,560
I car-will introduce myself.

35
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,260
What is it?

36
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,410
It was transformed into bucket.

37
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,540
Finished!

38
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,520
Miracles of the osseous rebuilding!

39
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,600
<i>SLIMUP WAPOL</i>

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,170
You will not go nowhere.

41
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,460
NOT!

42
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,720
I will begin my feast with you!

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,040
FIND!

44
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,970
Eh! I do not remember that it was also thin.

45
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,290
Luffy.

46
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,390
Why my jacket is very torn?!

47
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,280
Do you know how much it cost me?

48
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,860
28.000 Berry! And moreover, I had to haggle over to have it.

49
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,760
Afflicted! This guy drew me above with his guns.

50
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,670
I did not can anything make.

51
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,460
Frankly!

52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,720
Go, it is not serious. I forgive you.

53
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,420
In any event, when I lent my jacket to you, I did not expect to find it in good state.

54
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,760
N the other hand, you will give me just small extra of three times his purchase price.

55
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,320
You thus owe me 100.000 Berry.

56
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,490
Ah! You had mijoté that since the beginning?!

57
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,170
Ca is enough, band of little runts!

58
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,130
But it is that it is solid!

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,220
LOOK AT!

60
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,440
It is arms manufacture!

61
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,700
And I have the key of it!

62
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,830
Of course, you can imagine the varied number of weapons in any kind which there can be inside!

63
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,500
After all to have consumed them,

64
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,030
my capacity Baku Baku will make an integral part of my body of it!

65
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,130
In front of your eyes, I will become a human weapon feared throughout the world!

66
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,030
You will be impressed! I will open it!

67
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,780
The key of the doors of the hell is…

68
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,020
WHAT?!

69
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,750
Well, that is not finished yet.

70
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,360
He flees!

71
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,830
Stop!

72
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,500
I still have a cord with my arc!

73
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,900
What… it is the key of arms manufacture?!

74
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,190
I hoped that it was the key of a trunk…

75
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,360
What a damage!

76
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,630
Nami-San!

77
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,740
I am relieved! You do not have anything!

78
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,190
What did it occur, Sanji-Kun?

79
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,330
Are you slopes… you well?

80
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,490
Nami-San! You are really anxious of my fate?!

81
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,000
If I could right being kissed by this soft heat…!

82
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,460
Ca is enough!

83
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,640
Nami… San…

84
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,860
Wait!

85
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,170
Wait! Wait!

86
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,300
Shit!

87
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,480
Even the upper floors are covered with snow!

88
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,510
I will kill them, I will kill them all for what they did!

89
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,450
I will show them with a whole a first impression of what is the power of the king!

90
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,610
The power of Drum… it is mine.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,280
The supreme weapon of the Kingdom of Drum…

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,860
The Acier Canon with Seven Blows of the Crown of Drum!

93
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,790
You are made! Loan to take a beating?!

94
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,450
It is what you believe, Straw hat!

95
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,180
BURST!

96
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,160
A bird's nest?!

97
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,890
Of Snowbirds!

98
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,710
You make me pass for an imbecile…!

99
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,370
It is odd which there is a cable installed so far…

100
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,930
They are kids of the village who found it by chance!

101
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,360
Wouldn't Ca be the old house of Doctor Kureha?

102
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,970
There is a beautiful sight from here.

103
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,610
Yes, it is true.

104
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,910
Eh! You do not have the impression that one is too numerous on board?

105
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,140
One could not leave all alone Dalton-San, especially which it is wounded.

106
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,550
We there also will beat we.

107
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,070
I know, but one will not go well far with this train.

108
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,420
Pedal! There put more strength!

109
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,730
Dalton-San, you calm.

110
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,750
Wapol…

111
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,260
For which take you you, Dalton?

112
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,360
“There is no remedy against stupidity!”

113
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,490
You take to me for an idiot?

114
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,220
You think that you are a dispenser of justice who comes to save the widow and the orphan?

115
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,100
Did not dream, you are only one trusty servant!

116
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,110
Perhaps that a one week stay locked up in this cell will help you to become aware of your error of judgments.

117
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,940
Thus, your desires of rebellion will cease.

118
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,920
You are the chief of the guard in which populates it has a blind confidence.

119
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,210
Reflect there, Dalton.

120
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,050
You let yourself persuade by the stupid dream of this insane of Doctor Hiluluk.

121
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,500
To sacrifice your row and to destroy this country…

122
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,430
where is the merit in all that?

123
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,790
Look at me…

124
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,090
… I am the man who sat on the throne of this kingdom.

125
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
“I am sorry!”

126
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,180
Say these simple words and I release you, Dalton-Kun.

127
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,270
What a row?!

128
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,230
What a king?!

129
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,860
I am the king! Sovereign of the Kingdom of Drum!

130
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,450
I AM THE KING!

131
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,300
It is finished.

132
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,520
It does not matter.

133
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,330
That you would be a king… or that you would be a god…

134
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,680
How you would be tall… or that you would not be it, that does not count!

135
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,140
Because I am a pirate.

136
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,080
But of course that if, that counts, Straw hat!

137
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,160
The Kingdom of Drum is member of the World Government.

138
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,680
You measuring rods?

139
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,380
Ca wants to say that you are committing an international crime!

140
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,250
I said to you that did not have any importance.

141
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,610
It is my combat.

142
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,880
You… the snotty-nosed kid with the straw hat!

143
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,580
I will puff out you!

144
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,450
Try just to see!

145
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,470
I did not finish any with you!

146
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,980
Hein?! Its language was transformed into gun!

147
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,900
Burst!

148
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,270
Dalton-San! I beg you, hold out!

149
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,370
What do I have to make?

150
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,250
Dalton-San! Dalton-San!

151
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,220
Dalton-San!

152
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,550
I am well.

153
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,670
Dalton-San!

154
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,360
I… will finish some with this kingdom!

155
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,850
And this history!

156
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,080
Let us go, opens the eyes, Dalton!

157
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,810
Any country has its government!

158
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,430
You include/understand?

159
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,310
There are no feelings in policy!

160
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,590
It is true. The most important thing, it is the system.

161
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,130
Q- What you made?

162
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,930
Release me! Stop, please!

163
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,270
There are so many patients who need me!

164
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,890
Balance it with the sea.

165
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,490
If it resists, you can cut down it.

166
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,830
He. Leave me! I beg you!

167
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,950
There are patients who await me!

168
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,590
PLEASE!

169
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,430
What a way of controlling…?!

170
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,320
I am relieved. Nobody is sick here.

171
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,980
That is there of evil to control a country with its heart?!

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,010
D-Dalton-San!

173
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,220
Dalton-San!

174
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,010
What you…?

175
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,950
Dynamite!

176
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,030
Listen to me, everyone well.

177
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,700
Once arrived at the castle, I will infiltrate there and you will remain with cover.

178
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,110
You worry for him?

179
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,440
And why I would have?

180
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,980
It is a pirate!

181
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,240
Imbecile! You were made have!

182
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,910
Not, it is you!

183
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,830
What?

184
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,440
It left…

185
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,740
What? What do you make?

186
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,200
Eh, releases me!

187
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,730
Doctorine?

188
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,970
Yes.

189
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,130
It seems that one arrives at the outcome.

190
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,720
Ca will have taken time before putting a term at this kingdom.

191
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,700
It is the end…

192
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,750
This country is sick.

193
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,760
Its people too.

194
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,850
And the king and his government are it too.

195
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,100
The heart of people is ravaged.

196
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,740
One day, I will save this country with my medicine!

197
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,820
Break, charlatan!

198
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,440
Return never again!

199
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,080
Flee, Chopper!

200
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,460
If you are not ready to undergo the consequences of them…

201
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,560
… then does not approach you the flag to the tête de mort of another!

202
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,090
Doctor…

203
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,930
Wait!

204
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,660
I will give you a row… as well as a distinction!

205
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,890
Look at! There is somebody at the top of the castle!

206
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,730
Doctor…

207
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,790
The Kingdom…

208
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,120
The Kingdom of Drum has…

209
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,790
Of agreement, I will name you at the post of Vice King!

210
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,200
He… fell!

211
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,110
And thus the Kingdom of Drum was inclined vis-a-vis the flag with the tête de mort.

212
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,410
Agreement, I leave as a scout!

213
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,300
Ca goes! How everyone remains behind me!

214
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,300
Wait, Zoro!

215
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,050
It is the moment to show “my true power”!

216
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,980
Oh! Stop clutching you with me!

217
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,430
All is well, I am right behind you.

218
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,600
If you are afraid, why you remainders not in withdrawal?

219
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,800
J-J I am not afraid, C-it is that…

220
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,190
WHAT…?!

221
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,680
Luffy!

222
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,380
Eh! Zoro! Usopp!

223
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,880
BUT What TOOK to You TO MAKE CA?

224
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,770
He? It is you, the guy?

225
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,020
I did not recognize clothing of Zoro…

226
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,520
… then I thought that you were enemies.

227
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,630
Like did that, you climb the mountain?

228
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,310
Hadn't Usopp, you said that you could not climb?

229
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,090
It is ridiculous!

230
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,180
I am the kind of guy to be said:“If there is a mountain, it should be climbed”!

231
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,370
Although this rise was somewhat animated.

232
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,950
We came via the cable, Luffy-San.

233
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,980
It is unjust.

234
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,770
Nami-San and Sanji-San are well?

235
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,250
Ouais! They are well!

236
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:01,560
It is true that I was surprised when the giant condor attacked us.

237
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,500
They is marvellous!

238
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,670
Good news!

239
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,700
But obviously, I was there…

240
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,140
NOT!

241
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,150
I should rather say “I were there, like always”!

242
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,660
And what did you make at the top of the castle?

243
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,280
I knew what I had to do at the moment even where it came to strike me in the middle, I dodged it of a jump and…

244
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,770
… I circumvented it! Then I overlapped it!

245
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,580
I made the skin with a king.

246
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,010
And I was there! “Me” the captain, enfourchant the condor and flying through the skies!

247
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,040
Then that which was made dispatch in the airs a few moments ago…

248
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,070
… it was really Wapol?!

249
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,280
You beat it…?

250
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,240
Ouais, why?

251
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,980
“My name is Capitaine Usopp”!

252
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,180
And its two ministers?

253
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,070
It is the reindeer which put a beating to them.

254
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,540
Beaten… by a reindeer?

255
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,600
What do you say that? Impressing, hein?!

256
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,760
Ah ouais, Usopp! Listen to me!

257
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,430
As always…

258
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,890
I found us a new companion!

259
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,260
What?

260
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,350
A reindeer…

261
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,160
A reindeer?

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,270
A blue nose…

263
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,490
DECREE!

264
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,460
If it is because he made fun of died of Hiluluk, I excuse myself some!

265
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,470
Your force will not be of any utility if you die like a dog!

266
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,960
Would not be a sacrifice moreover for this country!

267
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,180
It was thus you… this day…

268
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,940
I see. You did not cease since then beating you.

269
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,180
Thank you.

270
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,780
Drum will be able…

271
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,050
To be able… to reappear!

272
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,020
Q - What is it? This odd creature!

273
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,640
One… a reindeer?

274
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,640
Not!

275
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,060
C-C' is a monstr- ***!

276
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,490
Eh, that is enough!

277
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,970
A MONSTER!

278
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,900
A MONSTER!

279
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,010
MONSTER DOES NOT TREAT IT!

280
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,110
It is him, the new companion whom I found!

281
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,520
What? This thing?

282
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,850
You frightened him!

283
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,100
Wait! The monster!

284
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,940
He!!

285
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,310
Eh, the reindeer!

286
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,000
He! The reindeer!!

287
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,520
But await me!

288
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,010
You are my companion!

289
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,070
Oh, Thundered-Chan!

290
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,740
You belong to my crew!

291
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,920
Doctor…

292
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,370
It of agreement, isn't this is?

293
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,010
Like that…

294
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,030
Wait! The reindeer!

295
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,670
I WILL NOT STOP!!

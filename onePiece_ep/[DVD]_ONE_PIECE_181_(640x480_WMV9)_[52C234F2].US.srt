1
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,620
What?

2
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,729
You already heard
to speak about Kairouseki…

3
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,660
Eneru?

4
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,009
Now, join death!

5
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,719
Stop.

6
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,080
I know. You have Reject.

7
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,619
Considering your state, you will die too.

8
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,179
What do you still wish?

9
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,369
You Vearth, isn't this wanted?

10
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,339
Close it.

11
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,760
Death is all that I wish…

12
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,349
if I can carry you with me!

13
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,710
With… Stop!

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,510
Reject

15
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,619
“Keep the truth in your
hearts, the closed mouth. “

16
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,549
“We are those who
will weave the history… “

17
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,860
These words were engraved on
Ponéglyphe, 800 years ago.

18
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,290
Ponéglyphe?

19
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,409
When those which sought
the stele appeared,

20
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,670
Warriors of the Gold City,
Shandora, fought with bravery.

21
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,069
They gained?

22
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,290
Yes, they gained.

23
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,989
But…

24
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,909
The battle was devastating.

25
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,740
The losses were disastrous.

26
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,609
Following the war, those
who tried to survive…

27
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,590
gave the responsability themselves to protect discreetly
ruins of the city and Ponéglyphe.

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,270
And they are our ancestors?

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,690
But 400 years ago, our island
was propelled on Skypiea…

30
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,530
and people of this country stole it to us.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,909
This ground that our ancestors
protected during centuries…

32
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,290
we was catch!

33
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,129
Upper Yard…

34
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,220
Our terre natale disappeared
in darkness of time…

35
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,929
with its enthralling history.

36
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,140
But even if it
find in the sky,

37
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,270
The courageous Flame of Shandora
must never die out.

38

43
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,300
Odd knight!

44
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,910
He…

45
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,620
It…

46
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,340
fact of beating its own heart?

47
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,020
It is not God only
people fear.

48
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,210
It is the terror which it incarnates.

49
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,510
Who is… this guy?

50
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,240
Wiper warrior, I had you
isn't defendant?

51
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,660
I had said to you to stop.

52
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,140
You saw what occurred?

53
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,360
You are really pitiful…

54
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,830
Wiper warrior.

55
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,680
Do not pronounce my name…

56
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,260
without reason!

57
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,490
It was 800 years ago…

58
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,080
when the destiny of this country
was sealed in the battle…

59
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,310
by the proud Shandia warriors!

60
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,470
And we are their descendants.

61
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,060
One day, our terre natale
we was suddenly concealed,

62
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,440
and during these 400 last years, we have
carried the regrets of the Large Karugara Warrior!

63
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,970
Since generations, our ancestors had one goal:to find this place!

64
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,730
And let us be there we finally!

65
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,270
And you are…

66
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,370
across our way.

67
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,230
I heard what you have
known as presently, Wiper.

68
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,680
Your Kairouseki has certainly
caused damage.

69
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,570
To use Reject only once is
sufficient to destroy human banal.

70
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,680
You hold still upright afterwards
to have used twice.

71
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,400
I congratulate you.

72
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,170
However, you have badly
chosen your adversary.

73
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,290
The drum is transformed into bird…

74
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,020

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,260
[Note:Hino = God of
thunder of Iroquois]

76
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,360
Is Kairouseki in it?

77
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,440
You also, epeist of the Blue Sea?

78
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,940
It is a thing which I must make!

79
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
[Note:Kiten = God
Japanese of the thunder]

80
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,020
ZORO!

81
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,340
It is not possible.

82
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,690
Even Zoro…

83
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,840
They… were done all to beat.

84
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,320
Why…?

85
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,210
This man…

86
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,080
He was seriously
touched, and despite everything…

87
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,190
And despite everything, it
wants to still fight?

88
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,199
What do you make there, upright?

89
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,669
You will die soon.

90
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,810
Why not leave in peace?

91
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,040
You said that 400 years ago…

92
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,990
you them Shandia, launched this war
in order to recover your terre natale.

93
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,440
Then finally, you are only
warrior who arrived up to now.

94
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,240
This country will turn over
soon in the Blue Sea.

95
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,940
It is God.

96
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,259
While continuing to fight, you
make that to worsen your situation.

97
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,340
Nobody can beat it!

98
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,060
Why remainders you upright?

99
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,820
For my ancestors!

100
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,060
I hoped for a more relevant answer.

101
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,140
I do not even know if
you are still conscious.

102
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,130
EL THOR

103
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,010
There remains nothing any more but you.

104
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,040
I…

105
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,100
I want to come with you!

106
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,260
I am to you!

107
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,380
Towards the World of the Dreams!

108
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,059
I cannot?

109
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,850
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

110
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,360
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

111
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,890
Wiper.

112
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,180
Wiper, come there.

113
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,700
Yes?

114
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,230
I will tell you a thing to
matter of the Large Karugara Warrior.

115
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,260
There was another reason why
he wanted to recover our fatherland so much.

116
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,310
Another… reason?

117
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,589
Yes.

118
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,070
For Karugara, it became
its greater regret.

119
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,469
Listen now.

120
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,130
The Large Karugara Warrior had…

121
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,589
That there
does it have?

122
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,460
You changed opinion?

123
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,999
Yes!

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,900
Heu not. I arrive!

125
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,609
What?

126
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,480
You want to take along that?

127
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,150
Not…

128
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,520
If I cannot, I leave it here.

129
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,160
I do not think that you will be able
to use where we go.

130
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,420
Lastly, make as you want.

131
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,089
Thank you very much!

132
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,770
I there am very attached.

133
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,059
Does that disturb you?

134
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,640
Oh, not…

135
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,159
Would not be so modest.

136
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,590
All that is due to their incapacity
to include/understand the capacities of God.

137
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,440
But you are different.

138
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,770
Frankly, it must be heavy
burden to keep in oneself the fear.

139
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,359
You do not believe?

140
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,380
Yes, certainly.

141
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,920
One should not only it
notice what I do.

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,179
I must do what he says.

143
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,179
I will find a means of
to flee. I am sure.

144
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,770
But until there…

145
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,020
What can it there
to have in it?

146
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,019
Excuse me…

147
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,400
You will follow me in silence.

148
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,870
It is what?

149
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,589
Then?

150
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,069
Splendid, isn't this?

151
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,090
This boat is single in the world. And I
am the only one with being able to control it.

152
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,040
In other words, it
function thanks to the lightning.

153
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,949
Incredible…

154
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,519
I include/understand your surprise.

155
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:32,040
All this was made possible thanks to a material able to transmit my superfluous energy.

156
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,740
A material able of
to transmit energy?

157
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,569
Yes.

158
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,960
It is the gold which
found in this city.

159
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,250
The people of this island will be magic.

160
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,439
While mourrant,

161
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,510
they will see their own eyes
the only flying boat of the world.

162
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,139
A flying boat?

163
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,879
It is impossible!

164
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,989
If this trick really flies,

165
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,290
I could not escape to me!

166
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,339
The Arch, Maxim!

167
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:19,710
In this boat, we will embark for
to travel towards the infinite ground, Fairy Vearth!

168
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,009
One is outside.

169
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,500
One finally arrived there.

170
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,969
The ground is paved.

171
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,620
Which is this place?

172
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,070
You see something?

173
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,670
He, I speak to you!

174
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,400
Luffy!

175
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,369
I LEFT!

176
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,820
I ARRIVED THERE!

177
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,009
He, looks at that.

178
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,219
Where sums us?

179
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,560
There are ruins everywhere.

180
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,230
This enormous gold bell
must be in the corner!

181
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,429
This would be…

182
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,439
our terre natale?

183
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,569
It is?

184
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,259
The guy, you are cool.

185
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,469
Is He, it what?

186
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,370
There is a giant hole with…

187
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,659
Luffy!

188
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,489
Wait!

189
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,500
What still occurs?!

190
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,540
You go where?!

191
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,909
Zoro!

192
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,019
He, go!

193
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,530
You insane what?!

194
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,139
If you were there, then…

195
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,910
how that could arrive?!

196
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,199
Nami…

197
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,899
Where is Nami?!

198
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,299
It is not there!

199
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,540
WIPER!

200
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,710
Even Wiper…

201
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,539
The guy with the bazooka…

202
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,979
It was so strong.

203
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,890
Who could all well overcome them?

204
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,870
It is Eneru!

205
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,860
It is only…

206
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,000
who could do that.

207
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,319
Is Eneru God, it is that?

208
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,579
Yes.

209
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,710
My Mantra did not go
when one was in the snake.

210
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,840
I could not know
what occurred outside.

211
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,910
Robin!

212
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,890
Madam Navigatrice…

213
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,650
left with him.

214
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,810
He, wait!

215
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,570
Quiet remainder.

216
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Did Nami leave with God?

217
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,409
By where?

218
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,140
I do not know.

219
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,469
Listen well.

220
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,119
If nothing is done, this country…

221
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,430
Skypiea will be destroyed.

222
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,020
The celestial island?

223
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
Our village too?

224
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,660
All.

225
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,360
Each man, woman and
child in the sky…

226
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,470
will turn over to surface.

227
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,429
And Eneru?

228
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,420
It will try to reach
the Gold Bell?

229
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,309
Yes, it is certain.

230
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,999
But if we make
less error while seeking,

231
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,219
We will not arrive there in time.

232
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,940
Do not make any you.

233
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,239
I hear them.

234
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,220
There are two votes which
move on the island.

235
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,220
It must be Nami and Eneru.

236
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,770
Aisa.

237
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,220
Take me along
over there!

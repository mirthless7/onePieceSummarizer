1
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:44,360
Usopp VS Daddy the Father

2
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:44,360
Duel in full day

3
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,020
Do not make the idiot! Stop! You will lose your arm! Its edge is exceptional!

4
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,520
I take it!

5
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,660
Seek Luffy!

6
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,310
It must hide some share
here in Logue Town!

7
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,050
Yes!

8
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,620
It is not worthwhile.

9
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,590
I am certain that it will be shown!

10
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,960
The bracket! The bracket!

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,230
The last vision which the Lord of the Pirates had before dying, I want to see it!

12
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,370
I want to see that as quickly as possible!

13
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,510
But… it is where the way towards the platform?

14
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,930
Colonel Smoker!

15
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,930
It is true that this man, Luffy, are on this island?

16
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,710
If it as quickly as possible is not stopped…

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,990
It is not necessary.

18
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,510
But it is intolerable!

19
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,240
Stop! Do not go further,

20
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,500
it is the office of the Colonel of the Navy!

21
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
Yo, Smoker.

22
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,290
It is you, Daddy?

23
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,450
Pete the Gangster and the Brothers Raidy Defrauders.

24
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,760
Rewards for these three?

25
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,450
There is another with the cemetery of them.

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
I need your signature to touch the rewards.

27
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,970
Not less than one million Berrys for the four!

28
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,480
That delinquents…

29
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,410
In this city there is full with premiums on large pirates who want to leave towards Grand Line.

30
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,530
For easy and sure work,

31
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,350
it is to better concentrate on the small criminals rather than on the large ones.

32
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,320
The man who was most talented before of the snipers of the Navy,

33
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,330
starts to drive out small preys.
It is odd.

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,950
I want to risk my life never again.

35
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,890
If you die, your daughter where to go, isn't this will not have nowhere?

36
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,360
Say hello to Carol of my share.

37
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,860
Yes, I will inform him of hello of his Smokey Uncle.

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,320
Isn't the bargain hunter Daddy Masterson?

39
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,220
Yes, it was my equal formerly!

40
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,570
It was an elite: it was responsible for the safety of the HQ of the Navy.

41
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,460
Why such a man…

42
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,900
A cursed saber?

43
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,870
Interesting.

44
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,610
That with the air to be excellent a katana!

45
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,920
You make what brothel, do not surprise me like that!

46
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,220
What do you make here, Zoro?

47
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,430
And you then?
Me?

48
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,490
I am lost!

49
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,840
Y' does not have what to be to trust.

50
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,820
Ah, say to me!

51
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,690
By where one must pass to go to the platform?
I found it! It is him!

52
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,910
Hein?

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,100
What?

54
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,780
Jerk! You ace dared to sell our comrades with the Navy?

55
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,540
One will make you pay very expensive!

56
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,220
Fire!

57
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,210
Return at home and tell your mom to prepare you cake, fiston.

58
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,870
Ouahh! Cool this Ossan!

59
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,870
Ossan: pejorative term to designate somebody of old

60
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,030
This man, it is surely…

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,160
Daddy the Father.

62
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,240
He He He! It is with me, with me, only with me!

63
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,250
I have all that it is necessary for me to become a honest warrior of the sea.

64
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,480
Did I forget something?

65
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,990
Ah yes. Most important, glasses!

66
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,760
A tireur d'élite of 1st class must have the best glasses,

67
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,280
it is the base of all the bases!

68
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,080
Even if all my money passes there, I must find a pair of it,

69
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,070
it is something which my heart of gunner will never regret!

70
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,180
Glasses! Glasses!

71
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,500
These are perfect!
Yes, these is these that I want!

72
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,180
I will take them, grandmother!

73
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,570
You ace the eye to locate quality!

74
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,250
It is the last model of North Blue.

75
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,840
I had them by a group of Navy before they leave on mission.

76
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,120
What? You do not have money?

77
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,390
I do not have time to lose with the poor.
Then you do what?

78
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,980
Euh… it is that…
Ah yes, there!

79
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,940
I would like these glasses, please.

80
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,560
Ah! Such a nice little girl!

81
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,390
Yes-Yes-Yes!
You have the air very happy!

82
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,640
They are the only glasses of this kind in all the city.

83
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,570
Wait a little!

84
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,810
I saw them in first…

85
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,810
No the chance, Ossan.

86
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,000
It called me “Ossan”…

87
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,470
He! Stop!

88
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,480
Let us be clear on top.
I am not a “Ossan”.

89
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,750
Me “Onii-Sama”, included/understood calls?

90
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,840
Hein? What you insinuate Ossan!

91
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,730
Aaah! You still called me like that?

92
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,900
Return to me these glasses initially,
I saw them the first!

93
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,470
Hein?

94
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,420
You ace a problem with me? Hein?

95
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,330
If you continuous on this tone,
I will call the Navy!

96
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,520
Navy?

97
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,220
Yes. I am a friend of the Colonel of the Navy of this city.

98
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,930
Smokey uncle.

99
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,940
It is which that one?

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,390
Obviously, you did not recognize me.

101
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,250
The large Usopp Captain,
who destroyed the pirates of Arlong!

102
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,560
It was really a combat until death!

103
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,540
They sent 200 to me, not 300 man-fish with my cases…

104
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,640
But I all beat them myself
by great blows!

105
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,140
Thanks to that, a premium of 30 million Berrys was put on my head!

106
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,010
Really, 30 million?
Yes, it is that.

107
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,750
Dad!

108
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,930
“Do Dad”, why you call me like that?

109
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
Hold, it is a gift for you Papa.

110
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,390
Happy birthday!

111
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,320
Oh… Carol!

112
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,730
You are really an angel…

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,780
I love you Carol-chan!

114
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,770
Dad, I adore you too. Dad.

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,190
It is what this relation father-girl?

116
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,820
But you know, but you know, Ossan tried to seize some.

117
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,670
Hola, hola. To steal it is not well.
Not well of the whole!

118
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,780
One should not make fear with the others!

119
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,190
Me…

120
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,560
It is you who ace annoyed my small Carol cherished?

121
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,150
And you know what?

122
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,530
Would Oh, your head be worth 30 million Berrys?

123
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,350
Let us see that…

124
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,140
They are the new research opinions?

125
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,680
Yes, I have just taken them with the Office Navy.

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,910
600.000…

127
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,650
1.300.000…

128
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,830
700.000…

129
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,810
30 million,
Luffy with the Straw hat…

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,030
To have a first precedes also high…

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,710
Wait, kid!

132
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,640
What is there?
Euh… you know…

133
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,610
In any event, I am not a required criminal!

134
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,710
It was a lie, a lie!

135
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,610
I wanted simply to frighten him…
Euh, I believe that I must

136
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,610
to leave now! With the r' to see!

137
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,230
It is you, not?

138
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,830
Yes, it is true. There is no doubt,
it is well me!

139
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
But lets warn you to me…

140
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,020
If you oses to pose a finger on me,

141
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,070
my Luffy captain will be completely furious!

142
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,940
He alarming, is made thirsty for blood and diabolic…

143
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,690
Never no enemy survived after having faced it!

144
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,960
You you have a child, not?

145
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,570
The life is an important good.

146
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,030
I see.
It is indeed a big problem.

147
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,990
It is true that this man is worth 30 million Berrys,

148
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,620
this Luffy must be a guy out of the commun run.

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,930
Dad! You must become stronger at all costs than him

150
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,880
because Papa is best world!

151
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,740
Carol! They is good!

152
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,140
If Dad gains enough money to live in happiness with you, it is more than enough!

153
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,200
You are more expensive in my eyes than the fact of becoming best world.

154
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,330
Dad…

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,200
In the final analysis, this guy seems sensitive and also intimidated…

156
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,000
If it is the case…

157
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,710
Then? You know now with what a not I am dangerous!

158
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,670
I will not speak to him about it,
but now return to me these glasses.

159
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,450
Hein?

160
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,460
Do not worry you.
I will refund you the price…

161
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,360
Thus… go, go, go!

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,650
He you!

163
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,600
I have just offered them to Papa and now, you want that one…

164
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,840
Dad…

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,060
Thus say, that you would think

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,140
of a duel in public to see which is the best?

167
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,150
A duel?

168
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,930
Take that.

169
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,460
By “duel”,

170
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,010
You insinuate a face-to-face discussion?

171
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,590
If you gain, I will return the glasses to you.

172
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,520
1,2,3,4,… 30 firearms?

173
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,780
Not!! You would not be…

174
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,960
Daddy the Father?

175
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,500
Indeed.

176
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,820
A duel!
I heard spoken about a duel!

177
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,880
Daddy the Father was defied by somebody!

178
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,840
He told “to Daddy the Father”?

179
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,350
The most gifted bargain hunter with the gun, it is Daddy the Father.

180
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,670
There are still the insane ones in East Blue?

181
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,670
I ask for myself what a kind of imbecile would like to face somebody like him!

182
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,360
This face…

183
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,500
Courage, length-nose!

184
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,370
Am not afraid to lose,
one will bury you in a quiet place

185
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,970
and your funeral will be prepared!

186
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,640
How did I arrive from there there?

187
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
I am weak?

188
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,390
The rules are simple!

189
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,170
After 10 pas, one is turned over and one draws!

190
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,990
Hum… Of agreement.

191
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,710
What you insane, you?

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,430
Nami!

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,900
To defy are Daddy the Father, stupid for you or what?

194
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,260
Keep silent yourself… it arrived like that!

195
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,200
Your mouth and looks at!

196
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,760
A duel in only one round.
Loans?

197
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,850
Yes.

198
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,790
Ahh…

199
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:20,950
One!

200
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,430
Two!

201
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,390
Three!

202
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,620
Four!

203
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,690
Five!

204
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,000
Thin… that occurs badly for me…

205
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,160
I am not likely any to overcome Daddy the Father!

206
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,340
Six!

207
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,300
I will die here?
It is not true…

208
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,400
Seven!

209
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,190
The adventure has just started!

210
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,150
I must still find courage and
the attitude of a true man.

211
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Eight!

212
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,680
Thank you and goodbye!!

213
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,320
Dad!

214
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,740
Brilliant, Dad.
Be too cool for you!

215
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,040
What? It is pathetic.

216
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,670
You call that a duel?

217
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,570
I thought that it would be more exciting.
What a waste of time!

218
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,380
I have right makes him release his gun.

219
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,360
Why you fled ace?
Species of coward, species of microbe…

220
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,580
Already, since the beginning you did not want to beat you, not truth?

221
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,860
I am sorry…
Forgive me!

222
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,030
Here is my true nature…

223
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,550
Even if you take my life,
that will not be useful to you with nothing.

224
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,600
Of agreement? Of agreement?
It is my only wish…

225
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,960
With… Wait!

226
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,340
Nami?

227
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,400
Ah, yes!

228
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
If it is money which you want, it will give you all that you want!

229
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,940
Then, I beg you, do not draw.
Save my life, please!

230
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,180
You…

231
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,910
Why you hide behind a woman?

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,920
In any event…

233
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,760
You make error.
Forget what I said.

234
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,450
It has nothing to do with all that!

235
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,860
If you draw on me, does not imply it then!

236
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,650
Usopp…
Please, I beg you.

237
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,740
Usopp?

238
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,150
You are called Usopp, it is that?

239
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,290
Yes.

240
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,000
Not possible…

241
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,800
Hein?

242
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,740
You would know a pirate of the crew of Russet-red Hair named Yasopp?

243
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,660
Yasopp?
It is the name of my father.

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,170
You… You already met my father?

245
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,140
I see… his son…

246
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,930
Dad?

247
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,620
In connection with this day… Until now,
I never spoke with somebody about this day.

248
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,690
But for you, it is different.

249
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,620
That occurred in a port as this one one day when the weather was hot…

250
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,790
Allons-y, Lieutenant Masterson!

251
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,210
A match in a round!

252
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,290
One!

253
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:03,950
Two!

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Three!

255
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,910
It gained!

256
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,240
Yasopp gained!

257
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,210
How?

258
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,350
Its adversary was a sniper except par of the Navy.

259
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,990
It was an obvious victory.

260
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,550
It is of Yasopp very spit!

261
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,650
Yasopp, finish it.

262
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,290
Yes, y' has anything more pitiful than somebody who lost a duel like that!

263
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,400
Kill to me.

264
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,150
I lost this duel,
I must die.

265
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,860
Ah, it is very noble of your share.

266
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,470
What do you make?

267
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,340
It is your daughter?

268
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,470
Return to me that…

269
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,100
You are a Lieutenant of talented Marine but,

270
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,270
by keeping that on you, you become rather sensitive.

271
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,100
Do not make me morals, pirate!

272
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,810
You are right!

273
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,600
Ah, played well Yasopp!

274
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,910
It was nothing.

275
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,070
This wound proves that I am not yet rather extremely.

276
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,020
But your adversary was Daddy Masterson!

277
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
What enabled you to gain, it is your talent.

278
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,390
None among us of it would have been able…

279
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,950
Afflicted, chief…

280
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,940
Thank you to have looked at the duel in silence.

281
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,320
They is good.

282
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,060
Want you, Lieutenant?

283
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,570
The family?

284
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,350
It is not really my field.

285
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,170
I have a son you know, his name is Usopp,
I did not see it since years!

286
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,010
I weighed the anchor by leaving it whereas he was yet only one baby.

287
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,450
Why?

288
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,920
You did not like your sons?

289
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,580
It is not that the problem.

290
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,370
This flag pirates…

291
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,010
Jolly Roger called me!

292
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,720
You ace well done Yasopp!

293
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,560
In any case…

294
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,230
I did not can anything make for my son.

295
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,440
A father as useless as me,

296
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,970
like me, that is enough!

297
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,700
You should remain close to your daughter.

298
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,880
Does not leave it all alone.

299
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,970
Good, of course, I am a little badly placed to say that to you.

300
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,160
I lost the duel.

301
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,690
Yasopp, finish with me!
I do not want your pity!

302
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,500
Not thank you.

303
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,580
If the Navy captures a pirate, it must carry out it.

304
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,350
For a pirate, to kill or not depends on its mood.

305
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,670
Good-bye!

306
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,580
History of an elite of the Navy which is reconverted as an bargain hunter,

307
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
it was thus that…

308
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,690
Dad… Dad lost against a pirate,

309
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,280
and it saved your life?

310
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,150
You lie, hein Papa?

311
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,710
But it is brilliant! Your father is a brilliant type!

312
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,850
He beat Daddy!

313
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,000
Moreover, he did not forget you!

314
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,920
There are chances that it is crossed
during our voyage.

315
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,150
Usopp?

316
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,630
Ahh, I include/understand what you feel.

317
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,050
Not, it is not for that…

318
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,390
It is not because of that I cry!

319
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Is it normal?

320
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,760
To tell did the history where you come very close to death?

321
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,080
To tell such a history with a coward like me?

322
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,030
You said that to me to give myself courage!

323
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,230
A history which normal people would have hidden at the bottom of them!

324
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,680
Even by knowing that I am if loose, you told it to me…

325
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,890
How my father carried out his life…

326
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,360
It is that?

327
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,690
That irritates me to be weak and loose!

328
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,220
Carol… Your Dad is a very large warrior.

329
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,780
Somebody moreover more extremely, one can always find some…

330
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,880
However, I ever saw as strong and nice somebody as your Dad…

331
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,040
I… I cannot lose the face like that!

332
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,670
If I do not gather all my courage,

333
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,910
I will be a shame for your Dad.

334
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,330
Daddy, gives me a chance,

335
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,130
I will put my life concerned this time

336
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,920
and I will not flee like presently!

337
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,570
Included/understood.

338
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,480
This time, it will be a true match.

339
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,820
Chosen the weapon with which you are more at ease.

340
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,960
Eh well, with that…

341
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,000
Let us see…

342
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,390
Prove to me that you are able to touch this whale.

343
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,500
The whale over there?

344
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,760
If you miss…

345
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,170
Ah, you will draw me a ball in full heart.

346
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,870
Usopp!

347
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,100
This time, it is about a duel where his life is risked!

348
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,850
Impossible…

349
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,330
How could you the touch with a weapon like that?

350
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,090
Co… As usual…

351
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,170
If I draw as usual, that should do it.

352
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,270
Yeah…

353
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,680
Concentrate!

354
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,960
It missed it!

355
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,400
Stop Papa!
Do not draw, Papa!

356
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,810
And why I would do it?

357
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,570
Usopp touched its target!

358
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,920
It is true!
It touched the crown!

359
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,140
Usopp!

360
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,350
What a talent!
It is the son of Yasopp very spit.

361
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,020
If you do not forget this courage,

362
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,590
one day,

363
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,470
you will be able to become like your father!

364
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,380
Goes on Grand Line.

365
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,400
Yasopp is without any doubt over there.
Daddy…

366
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,050
Be rather good for you, Ossan!

367
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,250
Oh, but it is…

368
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,860
That is appropriate to me. Hello.

369
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,170
Dad!

370
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,500
Carol, you do not have the right…

371
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,700
How can you say “hello”,
is not necessary to be too familiar!

372
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,400
Forgiveness, Dad…

373
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,510
As a girl of Dad,
I want to become a beautiful woman,

374
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,780
then forgives me!

375
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,520
You are already beautiful as you are now!

376
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,800
But I want to even become still and more beautiful!

377
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,100
After being fallen in disgrace,
he fights to protect those which he likes.

378
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,780
I want to become a man as courageous as Daddy.

379
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,920
I will become a true warrior one day

380
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,130
and I will be able to find myself face to face with my father!

381
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes!

382
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,920
Sanji!

383
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,980
I sought you Sanji…

384
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,200
Since ten years!

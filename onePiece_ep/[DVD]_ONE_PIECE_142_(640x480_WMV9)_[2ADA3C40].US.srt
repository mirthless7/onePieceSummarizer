1
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,790
What do you make!? One must bring all these tricks to them!

2
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,610
I know!

3
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,350
What they are noisy these horrible brats.

4
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,280
He, why are you so in a hurry?

5
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,790
Somebody is able to help us.

6
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,980
One will return in Ruluka.

7
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,190
Does Qu-Quelqu ' one arrive!?

8
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,040
Pa-do not leave!

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,990
Wait!

10
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,850
Let leave to me!

11
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,240
Hurry!

12
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,190
IF you like it, wait!

13
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,980
Take to me with you!

14
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,740
Will you leave me all alone there?

15
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,900
It is as if you killed me!

16
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,770
Return, please…

17
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,420
Open the cell.

18
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,660
Do not give up me.

19
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,530
Of agreement.

20
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,290
Thank you!

21
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,960
I owe you a proud candle.

22
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:02,890
Frantic fight!

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:02,890
Plans of Whetton and the Tower of the Rainbow

24
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,190
GOMU GOMU NO!

25
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,590
ROCKET!!

26
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,510
Release me, whore! Release me!

27
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,900
Stop that, Lapanui!

28
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,970
It would be a large error.

29
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,580
Henzo would never have become a dog of Whetton.

30
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,260
You believe that I will listen to a similar connery?

31
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,610
Whetton at burnt our city until there remain nothing any more!

32
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,550
Burn!

33
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,060
Burn! How all disappears!

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,920
This pain… This sadness…

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,390
If you had not forgotten them…

36
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,600
You would never have knelt in front of Whetton, even if your life depended on it!

37
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,320
In only 50 years, did you forget all that?

38
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,070
Even if that made 50 years for you,

39
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,020
For us it was right a few days!

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,370
Wait, Lapanui!

41
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,240
You say that because you do not know what it occurred!

42
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:04,510
Do you know at which point it suffered during these 50 years!?

43
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,600
What?

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,580
They called it the dog of Whetton.

45
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,220
All people showed it finger…

46
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,080
But it endured all that and continued its research on the Rainbow of the Fogs!

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,120
Why?

48
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,850
Isn't this obvious?

49
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,080
It was to save you!

50
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,860
It is not that.

51
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,180
Ca had nothing to do with them.

52
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,850
Strike me, Lapanui!

53
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,320
Forget shame and the pride.

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,920
Since the day when Whetton arrived, I lived my life under his orders…

55
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,460
Tighten your fist and strikes me!

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Strike me! Go ahead!

57
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,810
Fact of shitting!

58
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,640
How 50 years they could pass!

59
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,350
With this face, I could not strike you even if I wanted it!

60
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,640
And well, here is a beautiful bouquet of imbeciles.

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,470
Ok, it and good you is again comrades.

62
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,360
Even if 50 years passed,

63
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,600
You can always entrust one to you to the other.

64
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,150
Henzo!

65
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,850
Lapanui…

66
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,780
Afflicted!

67
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,130
Luffy!

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,640
What a idiotic!

69
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,030
They will be left there.

70
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,050
Inside the Fog, space is deformed.

71
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,140
They will return.

72
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,190
Or perhaps not…

73
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,170
One does what now?

74
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,480
One must find them!

75
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,090
One does not know what can arrive to them in the Fog.

76
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,160
This guy, it is really gifted for foutre the brothel.

77
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,020
Lapanui…

78
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,780
Where are we?

79
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,170
Raise me, immediately!

80
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,340
Eh oh, not of jokes hein?

81
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,450
Moved away, Nami!

82
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,320
He, made something!

83
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,810
This rate/rhythm, Nami will be made devour…

84
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,930
Sanji!

85
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,490
And what should that make me?

86
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,980
It is its punishment to have tried to be opposed to us.

87
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,490
But, Grandfather…

88
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,450
With a monster in water,

89
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,070
We cannot go either in Ape' S Concert.

90
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,650
I know it well!

91
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,000
But we can nothing make against this monster.

92
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,960
I WILL DIE!!!

93
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,710
I have just had an idea, Miss!

94
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,530
Use the device of help!

95
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Device of help?

96
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,970
It is professor Henzo who invented it!

97
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,290
I am sure that it was in preparation for situations like this one!

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,650
Professor Henzo?

99
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,310
No idea of which it is, but please, made that saves me!

100
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,340
A life line?

101
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,580
Nami-san!

102
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,610
Nami!

103
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,480
Not, remains with the variation!

104
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,120
What?

105
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,290
It was what… that?

106
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,910
Chopper, please!

107
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,100
Ah…! What do I have to make?

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,860
They is good, I have it!

109
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,010
I go in the Fog.

110
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,150
When I give the signal, draws on the cord.

111
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,600
Received!

112
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,230
It is impetuous, hein?

113
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,620
From all those which entered the Rainbow of the Fogs, nobody is come out from it alive.

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,260
It will return.

115
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,800
After all, Nami-san is the best navigatrice of the world.

116
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,560
Chopper, as long as Nami-san did not return,

117
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,030
Prevent whoever from touching this cord.

118
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,320
Included/understood well.

119
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,260
Interesting.

120
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,780
I think there that we will let it go.

121
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,940
We will keep an eye on it, to see whether it returns in life or not.

122
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,740
Qu

123
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,640
What?

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,100
The Mayor now will change behavior.

125
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,230
What does it make?

126
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,230
Combination of fire.

127
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,400
Reload elements started.

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,050
Reload elements started.

129
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,260
Interior pressure in increase.

130
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,930
Devices of ready helps!

131
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,650
I will burn you to the bones.

132
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,320
Hey, await me.

133
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
Where one goes?

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,200
You ace not of brain or what? Our companions were joined.

135
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,250
Serious?

136
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,220
Do you can how turn over close to the others?

137
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,770
Not, no idea.

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,180
Hein? What doesn't go?

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,090
Then you run simply because you feel it like that?

140
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,670
Of course that not!

141
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,080
It is my instinct!

142
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,430
It is the same thing!

143
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,930
All is of your fault, you returned to me inside!

144
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,870
Afflicted.

145
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,240
To excuse itself will not change anything.

146
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,710
I had finally reconciled myself with Henzo…

147
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,920
And I did not even can benefit from it.

148
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,940
And we will perhaps never re-examine Rulaka…

149
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,680
Fact of shitting!

150
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,150
I will finish like my father,

151
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,170
Dying in this rotten fog!

152
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,240
Your father?

153
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,040
My father was a naval officer.

154
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,640
When I was still small, it left on a journey to research a sea rainbow.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,780
And I remained only, while waiting for that it returns.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,030
I thought that it was some share on the ocean, living great adventures.

157
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,830
But…

158
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,730
Father!

159
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,240
Father!

160
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,870
I excavated all the ship,

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,380
But there was no sign of my father.

162
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,800
We really will be blocked here the remainder nowadays.

163
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,130
Prisoners in this fog for always.

164
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,140
He! Where do you go?

165
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,040
Reflected… I turn over near the others.

166
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,130
How!?

167
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,060
One does not even know where we are!

168
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,060
Do you hope to continue to advance in the Fog?

169
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,890
If one remains there, one, isn't this will never return?

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,210
You ace found something?

171
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,720
Nothing. I do not have anything considering.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,280
In the worst of the cases, they perhaps were sent to the fine bottom Fog.

173
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,810
What does that want to say?

174
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,560
Isn't Lapanui here any more?

175
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,500
It is possible…

176
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,440
Not…

177
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,910
It is… 200 years an old galleon.

178
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,560
And I never saw such a ship.

179
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,720
What can occur if time is deformed in Ape' S Concert?

180
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,490
He! The guy!

181
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,210
Oh, it is Nami.

182
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,360
I have right that to a “Oh”?

183
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,660
I came to save you, you know?

184
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,280
Which morons.

185
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,450
Do not be able to you already to run away itself all alone, I am mistaken?

186
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,490
Oh hoists.

187
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,280
Forget that, forgets that.

188
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,700
He, which is these kids?

189
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,280
And where is Luffy?

190
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,310
Why you have all this gloomy air?

191
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,210
It arrived something?

192
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,770
They went at the fine bottom of the Fog.

193
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,450
Hein?

194
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,680
I have just said it, they disappeared.

195
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,900
They are not there any more.

196
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,620
About what you do speak?

197
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,530
It is as he said.

198
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,400
One cannot explain you if you did not see what occurred.

199
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,430
OK…

200
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,840
Allons-y!

201
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,190
Wait!

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,900
And for Luffy?

203
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,320
I do not include/understand exactly what it occurs,

204
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,190
But it, isn't this will not die?

205
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,860
It can only manage.

206
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,390
Go, one returns!

207
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,830
Do you have a means to leave?

208
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,670
It is possible.

209
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,890
It is only one cord!

210
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,820
Then you are those which come from Ruluka?

211
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,380
Ian…

212
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,800
It is which him?

213
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,620
One of the companions of Whetton.

214
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,220
What does it make there?

215
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,630
Why is it here?

216
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,620
Now give me this cord.

217
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,710
Why?

218
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,860
If you want to leave the Fog,

219
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,090
You have to only come with us.

220
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,570
Do you hold with this boy?

221
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,970
Not really.

222
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,610
What!?

223
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,720
It is which this kid?

224
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,350
I am not enough nice to help from perfect abroad.

225
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,210
Well, I see that.

226
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,680
Wait, it was what that?

227
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,220
I will draw to him above! I swear that I will do it!

228
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,090
Loophole!

229
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,640
Please, listen to it!

230
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,820
You are too naive.

231
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,930
It is right…

232
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,660
He, stops!

233
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,110
I do not want to lose other comrades yet!

234
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,240
Please listen to it!

235
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,240
Well, Isoka-chan!

236
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,780
Now the life line to the boat goes down.

237
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,590
Do Isoka-chan, you want to come with me?

238
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,740
With all these treasures will have us what to amuse us all our life.

239
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,360
Do not mistake!

240
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,670
Our only chief is Lapanui!

241
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,480
We will never follow a coward like you!

242
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
What?

243
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,570
Course, Isoka!

244
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,500
Shit!

245
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,050
Longo!

246
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,760
Te insane step of me…

247
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,150
Stop!

248
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,920
Fact of shitting! Leave, leaves me me!

249
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,020
He! What is there?

250
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,370
Kairouseki.

251
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,510
What?

252
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,470
Shit!

253
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,740
Take that, poor idiot!

254
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,130
Does not let it leave!

255
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,380
Hurry and draws!

256
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,010
Wait

257
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,300
Dispatch! Dispatch! Dispatch!

258
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,840
I test, I test!

259
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,340
Dispatch!

260
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,920
I cannot draw!

261
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,410
Burn…

262
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,850
Burn!

263
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,790
Ca is used for nothing.

264
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,400
I will never avoid them like that.

265
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,310
Rumble!

266
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,980
Are Reik, you ready?

267
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,400
Electric combination, maximum power!

268
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,760
Not so quickly!

269
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,170
Spark dragon!

270
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,910
Chopper!

271
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,170
You should not let you distract!

272
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,520
It is what that?

273
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,020
Silver Barbecue!

274
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,560
Barbec…!?

275
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,790
You speak much for somebody about also pitiful.

276
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,320
You need to learn where is your place.

277
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,900
Grandfather!

278
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,280
Ca draws! Ca draws!

279
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,590
Does this girl really return from the Fog?

280
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,330
He, brings back this cord up to now.

281
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,340
Well!

282
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,630
Not yet!

283
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,600
What!?

284
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,650
I promised!

285
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,490
As long as Nami did not return,

286
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,020
You will not pose a finger on this cord!

287
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,560
Do not make me laugh.

288
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,920
Which promise?

289
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,500
What a joke!

290
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,190
Do you want the treasures at this point?

291
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,780
We do not want any of it.

292
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,750
Nami-san will return.

293
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,270
We must just leave him a sure place where to return.

294
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,900
PLAY

295
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,500
[kick with the cheek]

296
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,040
It is nauseating to see at which point you want to adapt my treasure.

297
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,730
Mr. Mayor, the boat arrives!

298
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,640
Well, draw the cord.

299
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,470
One will direct it by here.

300
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,590
These stupid kids!

301
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,270
They can pass the remainder of their days in the Fog!

302
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,830
Ah, that shown of the good again the blue sky!

303
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,790
Ah, I see it, I see it.

304
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,520
The town of Ruluka.

305
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,670
The standard CEC…

306
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,970
It is not Nami…?

307
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,460
T…

308
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,830
Afflicted to have made you wait!

309
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,240
Ian, with the report/ratio!

310
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,810
You seem in good health, Capitaine Whetton!

311
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,190
Me?

312
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,380
Yes, I am in good health. Thank you.

313
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,540
Ian?

314
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,580
Ian?

315
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,370
Es you Ian of my crew?

316
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,400
Does captain, what it want me this old nut?

317
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,550
And… And well…

318
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,000
I am the Captain.

319
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,330
I am Whetton.

320
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,840
Hein? Then it is which him?

321
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,010
My grandson, Reik.

322
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,580
I am his son, Philippe.

323
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,930
Not possible!

324
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,090
The Philippe who pissed of the half pints to the bed!?

325
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,020
You ace have a son?

326
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,610
It is too funny!

327
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,780
Stop laughing, stop!

328
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,980
Now me tells what there is in the Fog.

329
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,190
Have-IEA.

330
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,920
Here, drink.

331
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,860
Thank you!

332
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,530
Well?

333
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,470
No the chance, I do not collect anything.

334
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,920
The last transmission which passed…

335
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,050
Was probably due to a particular circumstance.

336
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,380
Which terrible bad luck.

337
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,690
These jewels are decorated with Kairouseki…

338
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,570
Kairouseki?

339
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,420
It is a crystallized substance of the ocean.

340
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,820
Ca with the capacity to destroy the capacities of the people having eaten a Fruit of the Demon.

341
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,730
Oh, there are so many treasures here…

342
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,500
But that does not have any interest if one cannot leave!

343
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,310
Be to you a navigatrice, nan? Find a solution.

344
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,290
I already tested.

345
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,230
I never sailed on a so chaotic sea.

346
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,640
Then, one can nothing make?

347
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,010
Not, they will return.

348
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,330
Why?

349
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,060
Whetton, can imports the means démoniaques which it will have to use, it will come to seek the treasure of Ape' S Concert.

350
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,340
Now that Ian, his/her companion of crew returned,

351
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,410
It will bring a garrison with him to invade us.

352
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,800
It is not funny!

353
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,860
One will fight!

354
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,770
I will not let anybody touch with my treasures!

355
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
And here…

356
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,110
So only Lapanui was there…

357
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,340
He! Remain with me!

358
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,180
He!

359
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,380
Fact of shitting!

360
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,730
Ca is not used for nothing!

361
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,180
One will row in vain of all our forces, one will not be able to return!

362
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,270
It is useless.

363
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,210
One cannot leave this fog any more now.

364
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,870
It is not serious.

365
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,970
We are only here.

366
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,580
One can sing when one wants, and play as much as one wants!

367
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,070
It is our paradise! A ground of freedom!

368
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,090
Neverland!

369
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,360
Lapanui!

370
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,440
We will never return!

371
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,460
We will create our country of our own hands.

372
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,560
I want to return in our city…

373
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,270
I want to return in Ruluka.

374

00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,274
Jango!

2
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:54,983
I will take care of this kid.

3
00:01:54,983 --> 00:01:55,484
I will take care of this kid.

4
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:56,485
I will take care of this kid.

5
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:00,030
I'll leave Kaya-ojousama to you.

6
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:01,949
She will write the will as planned...

7
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:03,075
She will write the will as planned...

8
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:03,534
She will write the will as planned...

9
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:03,617
She will write the will as planned...

10
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:05,327
Then kill her!

11
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:14,128
Usopp Pirate crew!!!

12
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:14,169
Usopp Pirate crew!!!

13
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,464
Usopp Pirate crew!!!

14
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,664
Protect Kaya!

15
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,064
Luffy!

16
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:23,345
I'll take Usopp and go after the hypnotist.

17
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:24,930
I'll take Usopp and go after the hypnotist.

18
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,305
I'll take Usopp and go after the hypnotist.

19
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:25,722
Any problems?

20
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:26,390
Any problems?

21
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,100
Nope! Get goin'!

22
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:33,800
What?

23
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,862
That's Captain Kuro!

24
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:42,281
Captain Kuro! Banzai!

25
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:42,739
Captain Kuro! Banzai!

26
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:43,240
Captain Kuro!

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,866
Captain Kuro!

28
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:44,324
Kuro of many tricks!

29
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:45,617
Kuro of many tricks!

30
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:49,455
That name... Don't call me by that!

31
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:54,001
For this is... my plan to completely
be rid of the name, ''Captain Kuro''!

32
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,901
I had enough...

33
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:56,795
The days when I had to plan everything for you
guys, whom only knew how to make a ruckus!

34
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:58,088
The days when I had to plan everything for you
guys, whom only knew how to make a ruckus!

35

37
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:58,672
The days when I had to plan everything for you

38
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,797
The days when I had to plan everything for you

47
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:00,799
The days when I had to plan everything for you

48
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:00,924
The days when I had to plan everything for you

49
00:03:00,924 --> 00:03:01,633
The days when I had to plan everything for you
guys, whom only knew how to make a ruckus!

50
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:07,890
Enough of those government dogs who
kept chasing me for the reward!

51
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,314
Wha... what?!

52
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:22,279
You can't take it anymore, you say?!

53
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,405
You can't take it anymore, you say?!

54
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:23,572
You can't take it anymore, you say?!

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,782
If you're so afraid of the fame on the sea,
then you're not qualified to be a pirate!

56
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:26,033
If you're so afraid of the fame on the sea,
then you're not qualified to be a pirate!

57
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:26,200
If you're so afraid of the fame on the sea,
then you're not qualified to be a pirate!

58

62
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:28,952
If you're so afraid of the fame on the sea,
then you're not qualified to be a pirate!

63
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:34,249
If you wanna compare ambitions...

64
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:35,083
Mine is much greater!!!

65
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,251
Mine is much greater!!!

66
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:37,795
PROTECT KAYA!
USOPP PIRATE GANG TAKES ACTION!

67
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:37,878

73
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:57,356
Is that hypnotist still behind us?

74
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:57,564
Nope, don't see Him.

75
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:57,606
Nope, don't see Him.

76
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:57,689
Nope, don't see Him.

77
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:57,773
Nope, don't see Him.

00:03:57,773 --> 00:03:57,940
Nope, don't see Him.

79
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,106
Nope, don't see Him.

80
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:58,190
Nope, don't see Him.

81
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,273
Nope, don't see Him.

82
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:58,524
Nope, don't see Him.

83
00:03:58,524 --> 00:03:58,607
Nope, don't see Him.

84
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:58,690
Nope, don't see Him.

85
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:58,774
Nope, don't see Him.

86
00:03:58,774 --> 00:03:58,857
Nope, don't see Him.

87
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,859
We'll definitely lose him!

88
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:01,068
It's just not possible to catch us in this forest.

89
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:01,151
It's just not possible to catch us in this forest.

90

00:04:04,863 --> 00:04:05,030
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

112
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,280
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,447
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

114
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:05,531
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

115
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:05,614
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

116
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:05,781
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

117
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:05,864
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

118
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:06,031
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

119
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:06,323
Don't worry, Kaya-san.

120
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,575
We'll protect you!

121
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,954
Right, we swear it in the name
of the Usopp Pirate crew!

122
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:14,706
Thank you.

123
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,110
Not here...

124
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,864
Where are you, little weasels?!

125
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:47,739
Don't be so sure that you can get away from me!

126
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,366
Don't be so sure that you can get away from me!

127
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:49,575
Don't be so sure that you can get away from me!

128
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:49,658
Don't be so sure that you can get away from me!

129
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:53,704
In that case, maybe I should just
clear out the entire forest.

130
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:54,663
In that case, maybe I should just
clear out the entire forest.

131
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:58,000
In that case, maybe I should just
clear out the entire forest.

132
00:04:59,626 --> 00:04:59,835
He seems to be very angry.

133
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:00,169

He seems to be very angry.

140
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:01,336
He seems to be very angry.

141
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:04,715
He's not just a hypnotist.

142
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,472
Where did they run off to?

143
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:13,348
This way!

144
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,159
Where did you go?

145
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,911
You little brats!

146
00:05:35,537 --> 00:05:36,121
Hey! East, go east!

147
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:36,163
Hey! East, go east!

148
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:36,455
Hey! East, go east!

149
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,247
Hey! East, go east!

150
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:37,956
I said east, didn't you hear me?!

151
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:38,248
I said east, didn't you hear me?!

152
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,416
I said east, didn't you hear me?!

153
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,209
How should I know!

154
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:41,585
Just say left or right!

155
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:42,628
Then, go the other way, to the left!

156
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,086
Then, go the other way, to the left!

157
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,213
The other way?!

158
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,009
Kaya-san!

159
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,890
Sorry, you guys should go ahead
and escape without me.

160
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:56,099
What're you talking about?

161
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,852
Our mission is to protect you, Kaya-san!

162
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,773
Oh no! She's burning up!

163
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:04,441
Hang in there Kaya-san.

164
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:05,734
We need a doctor, a doctor!

165
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,820
Idiot! This is no time for a doctor.

166
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,655
We're about to get kilIed!

167
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,658
But, we can no longer run.

168
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,492
Still...

169
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:16,036
Where are you, little brats?!

170
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:25,087
Thank you.

171
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,256
I'm happy that you guys are watching over me.

172
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,050
I'll keep that spirit in my heart...

173
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:31,927
Now, you three should escape.

174
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:35,973
Where are you running to?

175
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:36,223
Where are you running to?

176
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:38,559
No use in escaping now!

177
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:39,977
Come out!!!

178
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:49,069
If we leave Kaya-san and run, we'll surely make it.

179
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,530
Definitely.

180
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:51,780
Captain always said, ''If you find yourselves
losing, then turn tail as fast as you can!''

181
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,827
Captain always said, ''If you find yourselves
losing, then turn tail as fast as you can!''

182
00:06:58,537 --> 00:06:58,662
Damn kids, where are you!?

183
00:06:58,662 --> 00:06:58,704
Damn kids, where are you!?

184
00:06:58,704 --> 00:06:58,745
Damn kids, where are you!?

185
00:06:58,745 --> 00:06:59,037
Damn kids, where are you!?

186
00:06:59,037 --> 00:06:59,163
Damn kids, where are you!?

187
00:06:59,163 --> 00:06:59,621
Damn kids, where are you!?

188
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:00,664
Damn kids, where are you!?

189
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:15,971
But, Captain's just a liar!

190
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,267
He's fighting hard himself.

191
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,186
Disregarding his own life, trying to protect us!

192
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,729
Disregarding his own life, trying to protect us!

193
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:24,104
Disregarding his own life, trying to protect us!

194
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:28,108
We can't let Kaya-san die!

195
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:30,694
In that case, we're gonna go all out!

196
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:31,904
Usopp Pirate crew!

197
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,821
Yosh!

198
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:32,905
Let's fight to the death!

199
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:33,989
Let's fight to the death!

200
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,157
No, don't!

201
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,493
You guys are still kids.

202
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,287
You guys can't die just because of me!

203
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:43,373
''We're not going out to die, we're fighting to live!''

204
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,627
That's what Captain always said.

205
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:58,180
Brats.

206
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:08,732
That bastard...

207
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:10,984
Captain Kuro's cat claws...

208
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,073
Only five left, eh?

209
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,699
Those weird swords of yours.

210
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,584
It's alright, he can still fight!

211
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:30,045
Right, he's still got his other hand.

212
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:33,257
Slaughter that guy, Captain Kuro!

213
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,218
Hey, ain't that name taboo?

214
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:40,722
I'm sure that he's known as Kuraha-something
around here...

215
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:41,890
Then, we'll let's just call him ''Kura-san''.

216
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,893
Kura-san, kill him!!!

217
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:45,727
Kura-san, kill him!!!

218
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,437
Kura san kill him! Kura-san!

219
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:49,273
You fools...

220
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,108
SHUT THE HELL UP!

221
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:59,700
I will exterminate all of you later...

222
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:02,494
Of course, Jango as well!

223
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,164
Why do you wanna kill us?

224
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,542
Don't kid us around like that, Captain Kuro.

225
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,421
If we were to attack the village now,
it still shouldn't be too late.

226
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:17,593
Besides, as long as Captain Jango gets that girl
to write the will, the plan will be complete!

227
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,472
You don't need to worry about the plan anymore.

228
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,685
As long as your bodies are here,
I can prove my innocence.

229
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:32,649
I never planned to have you guys
leave this village in the first place.

230
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:34,359
It would've been troublesome.

231
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:38,405
I don't want anyone to find me still alive and kickin'.

232
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:40,324
No way!

233
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:44,620
So, you've already had plans to kill us all?

234
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:47,998
That's right.

235
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:54,087
I planned it way back when I was still
Captain Kuro, three years ago.

236
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:55,839
Everything...

237
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,967
Everything was planned!

238
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,347
Are you all morons?

239
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,682
What a dumb pirate crew...

240
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,310
''Dumb'', you say?

241
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:13,982
A pirate crew is merely a bunch of dogs which
aren't fit to live in a civilized society.

242
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,027
Without a plan laid out for them, what can they do?

243
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:21,281
It's always been my plans that they follow.

244
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:25,619
Shipmates are just pawns at a captain's disposal.

245
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:29,706
Whether they live or die, it's all up to me!

246
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:34,211
No matter how big the obstacle
is, my plan must proceed.

247
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,798
They are supposed to die to fulfill my plans.

248
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:55,399
This is the fate of pirates!

249
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:58,443
Don't you dare lecture me, boy!!

250
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,284
Even if a captain like you...

251
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:09,246
had tens of thousands of men...

252
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,749
You can never win against Usopp!

253
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:17,087
What'd you say?

254
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:21,842
I can't compare to that make-believe captain?

255
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,718
That's right.

256
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,316
That's really funny.

257
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:30,934
Don't think too highly of yourself just because
you took care of one of my hands.

258
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:33,604
Where can he surpass me?

259
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,731
Tell me!

260
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,820
Composure.

261
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:43,822
What?

262
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:49,661
You don't know the real meaning of being a pirate!!!

263
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,090
That bastard...

264
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,093
He can actually keep up with the
speed of the Stealth foot?!

265
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,390
You dare insult me.

266
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:18,190
If you really wanna know what a real pirate
is like, then let me show you right now.

267
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,401
How terrifying..

268
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:27,616
How terrifying a pirate is when he's been
to helI and back countless times!

269
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,874
Hey, that pose... could it be...?

270
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,876
He's going to use that?

271
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,129
He's got only one enemy.

272
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:42,172
But... no doubt about it!

273
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:45,300
It's Shakushi! He's going to do the Shakushi!

274
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,554
We shouldn't just be standing around here.

275
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:50,082
We're within range too!

276
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,723
Is he going to kill us too?!

277
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,308
Didn't he say that earlier?!

278
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:55,686
Please stop, Captain Kuro!

279
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,104
Don't do it!

280
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:59,022
We'll do anything you want!

281
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,275
Please, Captain Kuro!!

282
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,152
What's going on?

283
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,904
Isn't he just swaying back and forth?

284
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:12,077
Captain Kuro!

285
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,036
Captain!!

286
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,204
Please stop!
Captain!!

287
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:14,580
Please stop!

288
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:31,930
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

289
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:38,936
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

290
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:00,709
Please stop! Captain Kuro!!

291
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,461
SHAKUSHI!

292
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:16,391
Cheap.

293
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:20,187
I thought they'd have more treasures than this.

294
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:24,024
Now then, it should be over right about now.

295
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:26,527
What?

296
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,320
Nobody's moving.

297
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:30,155
Is it over already?

298
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:39,748
He's here!

299
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,001
Ho... how did he get killed?

300
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,839
Another!

301
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:49,800
This time it's the rock.

302
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,809
Please stop this, Captain Kuro!!

303
00:14:58,809 --> 00:14:59,476
No use!

304
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:00,811
This is a blind attack using his Stealth foot.

305
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:01,728
This is a blind attack using his SteaIth foot.

306
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:05,107
He's moving so fast that he can't
even telI who he's killing.

307
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,528
In the past, he killed countless numbers
of our own men with that move..!

308
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:10,487
Hey!

309
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:18,328
Wh... what's going on?

310
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:20,831
Why's everyone getting killed, so suddenly?

311
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:38,515
Reveal yourself... caretaker!

312
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:56,325
What do you take your men for?!!

313
00:15:58,952 --> 00:15:59,745
Luffy...

314
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:27,314
Found ya.

315
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:29,483
You bastard...

316
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:32,444
You should've just stood still and let me finish them.

317
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:33,445
Look!

318
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:38,659
Because of you, all my beloved men are half dead.

319
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:42,412
It would've been more humane to kill them off.

320
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,712
What now?

321
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,173
You look like you've got something to say...

322
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,010
I will never become...

323
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:00,806
A man like you.

324
00:17:01,181 --> 00:17:02,516
It's not that you won't...

325
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:06,895
You can't.

326
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,273
Not with that talent.

327
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:20,409
Furthermore...

328
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,704
You're gonna die right here.

329
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,500
You're going to feel the agony of being
cut into pieces and then die.

330
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,796
I'll treat you with special care...

331
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,007
I won't hold anything back when I work on you.

332
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,597
Don't think so!

333
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,891
SHAKUSHI!

334
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,321
Come out, you little brats!

335
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,573
I know you're hiding around here!

336
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,283
Just give it up!

337
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,080
We give up!

338
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:08,624
You can have Kaya-san.

339
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:12,628
Come here and we'll take you to Kaya-san.

340
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:16,632
I won't fall for that.

341
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:19,927
There's no way I'd believe words from little brats.

342
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,267
He fell for it!!

343
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,101
Now!

344
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:33,690
Take that, Pepper Attack!

345
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:48,914
I knew it... it was... was a trap.

346
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,547
Here you go!!

347
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,392
Die, you hypnotist!

348
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:17,025
Don't get cocky.

349
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,363
Damn, we failed?

350
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:23,949
You didn't take me seriously.

351
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:26,702
I am a pirate after all.

352
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:30,289
Tamanegi!!

353
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:34,918
You guys went overboard posing as pirates.

354
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:41,008
Where are you hiding, Ojousan?

355
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,553
I'll kill these three first.

356
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:52,269
You can all contemplate on how stupid it
was to mess with a real pirate, in hell.

357
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,778
There you are...

358
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,114
Don't!

359
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:05,782
Run! Kaya-san!

360
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,785
Run!!!

361
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:09,745
Hey!

362
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:11,705
It's their voice!

363
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,123
That way!

364
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,043
Please stop this.

365
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:18,462
Don't hurt them.

366
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:20,964
I'Il write the will.

367
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:22,633
No, you mustn't!

368
00:20:23,175 --> 00:20:26,136
Once you write it, he'll kill you!

369
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:30,933
I'm sorry...

370
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:35,145
Stupid, don't negotiate with me.

371
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:38,941
Captain Kuro wants me to kill everybody.

372
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:40,067
That can't...

373
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,454
If you don't meet my demands,
I won't wait for you to kill me!

374
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:53,914
Then there'll be no will!

375
00:20:53,914 --> 00:20:55,958
N-No... no..! W-wait... wait..!

376
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,209
Don't do that!

377
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:00,504
I'll be dead meat if you don't write that will!

378
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:02,965
Ka... Kaya-san!

379
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,264
Fine, I'll let these kids go.

380
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:13,559
However, I doubt that they'll
be able to escape anyways.

381
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:21,733
Here.

382
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:26,738
Don't forget to sign!

383
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,115
I know...

384
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,288
Damn!

385
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:40,502
''I leave all my wealth to my caretaker, Kurahadol.''

386
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:43,672
Good, this'll do.

387
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:46,216
This saves me the trouble of hypnotizing you.

388
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:51,472
You promised not to kiIl them, right?

389
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:58,645
Don't worry, I'm a man of my
word, despite my appearance.

390
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:03,525
Kaya-san!

391
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:06,153
Found 'em!

392
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:08,655
Found 'em, found 'em, found 'em..!

393
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,574
I'm wounded there!

394
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:11,658
Over there!!!

395
00:22:14,037 --> 00:22:15,329
Yosh! I'm off!

396
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,957
This is the end, you hypnotizing-freak!

397
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:21,627
Shit! He found us!

398
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,762
It seems like I have to end this quickly.

1
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,959
Under the orders of Wiper,
the Shandia warriors…

2
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,540
having learned the dispute between Gan Fall
and the Priests, benefit from the occasion…

3
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,070
to launch an attack on Upper Yard.

4
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,870
Our goal is the Sanctuary of God!

5
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,950
Do not fear Eneru!

6
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,630
The Large Karugara Warrior
we will protect forever!

7
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,930
OUAIS!

8
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,730
You here is, Shandia!

9
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,609
A little further, after having overcome
Satori, Luffy and its crew…

10
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,809
took again the road in
direction of the Sacrificial Furnace bridge.

11
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,140
Meanwhile, Gan Fall, casualty,
and Chopper, survivor of water,

12
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,610
were saved by the strange ones
birds of the island of Jaya.

13
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,560
A band of Birds of the South…

14
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,410
But, why? Why
are they so large?

15
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,480
It is you who saved us?

16
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,060
This man is God?!

17
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,930
During this time, Nami, Zoro and Robin,

18
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,150
reach the shore of Upper Yard
and do one surprising discovered.

19
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,590
It is a piece of the same island…

20
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,479
A piece of Jaya!

21
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,170
What Norland had discovered in bottom…

22
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,350
The gold city did not run.

23
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,940
For 400 years, Jaya had been
there, floating in the sky!

24
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:46,210
Jaya, Country of floating Gold!
The Sanctuary of God!

25
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,140
Thank you, God!

26
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,269
After all these efforts for
to reach the celestial island…

27
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,249
and finally to discover
that it is about the Country of Gold!

28
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,140
It is to reward me to have
summer a nice girl, not true?

29
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,120
My God!

30
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,250
You! I believed that this
island of God terrified you.

31
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,239
Hein? God?

32
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,129
He has value?

33
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,610
More what gold?

34
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,210
You do not come from
to say, “Thank you, God”?

35
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,890
This chick becomes senile!

36
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,930
Useless!

37
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,850
Is He, it what this place?

38
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,490
According to me, it is the zone
next Ordalie.

39
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,279
Another Priest will point himself.

40
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
Remain on your guards.

41
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,520
Oh not, only one Ordalie me
was largely enough, brothel!

42
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,449
It will be what this time?

43
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,809
Wire?

44
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,689
Iron?!

45
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,729
Marshes?!

46
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,509
Ca has me all the air of a banal meadow.

47
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,979
Ca does not have anything banal!

48
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,989
Open your eyes and looks at well!

49
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,810
All these craniums on piles!

50
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,169
Ouah! You ace reason!

51
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,260
It is what these tricks?

52
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,340
Another of these
monstrous Prêtres will emerge?

53
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,029
Ca with the air is delirious!

54
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,469
On which Ordalie one will fall?

55
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,499
Cretin!

56
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,440
If one is made kill by a Priest,
one will finish on piles like them!

57
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,289
Do not worry you!

58
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,630
One will not lose!

59
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,259
A trick approaches.

60
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,549
What?!

61
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,019
Iron?

62
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,479
Wire?

63
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,049
Marshes?

64
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,899
They all arrive at the same time?!

65
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,920
Ca would regulate the problem.

66
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,500
HERE THEY ARE!!!

67
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,999
Dumb!

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,430
GOMU GOMU NO FUUSEN!
[Fuusen = Balloon]

69
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,640
It was what?!

70
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,260
Paramécia.

71
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,670
He ate a Fruit of the Demon which
he get superhuman capacities.

72
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,130
Does Wiper, one face it?

73
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,030
Not, leave it.

74
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,020
Hein? This guy…

75
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,859
He, why you ace does that?!

76
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,199
You seek me?!

77
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,990
Cretin, come to beat you!

78
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,259
It, isn't this is you?

79
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,820
Inhabitants of the Blue Sea
who foutent the brothel on Skypiea.

80
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,079
He, Luffy.

81
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,990
It is the masked warrior who one
crossed on the White Sea.

82
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,130
It is what that…?

83
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,360
He splits the clouds!

84
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,550
He! Stop! What do you want?

85
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,790
You will release!

86
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,270
He wants to fight!

87
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,329
Ca is appropriate to me.

88
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,270
What? What?

89
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,310
Alarming! Alarming!
The alarming celestial island!

90
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,400
If you hold with the life,
turn over on the Blue Sea.

91
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,040
If it came you to the idea to try
anything on this island…

92
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,850
… we will eliminate you
how we will eliminate Eneru!

93
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,029
Do these types intend to overcome Eneru?

94
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,129
What means that
warriors and God…

95
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,759
are not in the same camp?

96
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,439
They are not Priests?

97
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,060
Then we do not occupy
they and draw us, Luffy!

98
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,439
You seek me, dumb?! Come here!

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,309
I will burst you!

100
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,289
Stop! Please,
leave them quiet!

101
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,619
I arrive!

102
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,799
Remain where are to you!

103
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,290
Prepare to take
shaken your life!

104
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,930
He insists…

105
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,460
I do not know if you will be
able to leave this island.

106
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,140
Who are these types?

107
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,610
All that we know, it is that they
have a tooth against Eneru God…

108
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,500
and against us too.

109
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,280
Whore…

110
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,880
Ca fears, this island…

111
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,630
Let us carry on our road.

112
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,459
Oh, my disease of “I--must-not
enter-in-this-jungle " begins again to me…

113
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,109
Good, I have the flagstone.

114
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,589
How can you to think of puff out?!

115
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,399
I cannot even rise!

116
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,239
Ok, Luffy.

117
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,349
We change the ideas into
singing the song of Sanji!

118
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,219
Ok.

119
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,749
Give me your hand!

120
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,430
NOT! It is not like that!

121
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,530
I cover you!

122
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,020
Profit to leave!

123
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,170
Now!

124
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,809
Something approaches! Somebody
approaches! I am sure!

125
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,489
They will not leave us
to leave also easily!

126
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,240
They arrive in group,
in herd, horde…

127
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,730
[Note:Zorozoro = in group, with the file]

128
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,270
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

129
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,860
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

130
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,820
He, that done one moment
that one sails, Sanji.

131
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,260
He, Sanji!

132
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,489
Ouais.

133
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,499
We crossed this
meadow without encumbers.

134
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,619
Let us continue in
series nothing--himself-passes!

135
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,820
Ouais, one will be left there, it is sure!

136
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,479
Q-what still?

137
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,810
What?

138
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,439
Look at-that, Usopp!

139
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,700
It is terrible!

140
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,470
Why one turns?
One goes where like that?!

141
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,430
I have the tournis!

142
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,679
Ca goes quickly!

143
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
Not, imbecile…

144
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,880
One falls!

145
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,320
A thing is sure,
Milky Road is too is delirious!

146
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,320
I will be sick…

147
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,040
He, it starts to make night.

148
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,590
Will Ca be like that to the Furnace bridge?

149
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,160
The sun lies down…

150
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,169
I do not manage to see
through the clouds.

151
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,850
There are also couchers
of sun on the celestial island.

152
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,670
Wiper, Kamakiri is by there!

153
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,640
They need assistance over there!

154
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,170
Chopper!

155
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,800
Where are you?

156
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,559
It occurred something, Chopper?!

157
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,380
Answer me!

158
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,059
He, it has there no more mast on Merry.

159
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,399
What did it still adulterate?

160
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,819
You ace nothing included/understood!

161
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,780
It was made attack!

162
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,429
Chopper!

163
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,769
Afflicted to have been so long!

164
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,529
You can leave now!

165
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,040
You are there, hein?!

166
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,659
Stop hiding you!

167
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,180
Answer me, Chopper!

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,079
It was perhaps done
to cut out of pieces.

169
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,940
Stop saying such horrors!

170
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,129
He, Chopper! Be to you there or not?!

171
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,639
What occurred?!

172
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,180
Speak!

173
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,520
R…

174
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,980
Nothing…

175
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,790
It did without anything terrible!

176
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,539
Of agreement, agreement.

177
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,939
You are large and strong.

178
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,690
Now, say to us
what occurred.

179
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,999
One is again
above the trees!

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,539
This time, it is a giant tree!

181
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,290
He, you should take
that more with serious, Luffy.

182
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,139
What is it?

183
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,489
Ca does not feel good…

184
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,270
There is something with the end?

185
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,189
I have like the impression
that at the end of Milky Road,

186
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,240
the Priests are in
train awaiting us.

187
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,199
It is brilliant!

188
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,970
I adore this trick!

189
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,770
One still will turn?!

190
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,909
He, there is something in bottom.

191
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,779
Over there!

192
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,279
They is surely the Priests!

193
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,789
Not, they are celestial sharks.

194
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,539
Oh, then they are not the Priests.
They are right some sharks

195
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,790
He, He, He, He, be serious for you?!

196
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,560
They are enormous! They
will swallow us very believed!

197
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:50,360
GOMU GOMU NO GATLIN GUN!!

198
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,590
One is soaked!

199
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,710
He, look at!

200
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,709
They were found!

201
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,279
It is the Merry Vogue!

202
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,050
Ca must be the Furnace bridge!

203
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,589
Hello, Nami-san…!

204
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,689
Robin-chwan…!

205
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,770
You missed me…?

206
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,720
I exceeded Ordalie of the Love!

207
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,869
What? It was Ordalie
what one faced?

208
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,629
You were not too afraid?

209
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,080
You reassure, now that
the Usopp Captain is there!

210
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,909
Mellorine! Mellorine!

211
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,059
They have the air in form.

212
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,880
Ah, here me is relieved.

213
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,049
The mast is…

214
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,130
Party.

215
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,369
Heu, Usopp… I am sorry.

216
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,700
I have do all that I could, but…

217
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,329
Ca burned everywhere, and…

218
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,980
Are He, you well?

219
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,620
Yes.

220
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,719
This guy with his lance
flamer must be dangerous.

221
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,590
But at least you did not cramé with!

222
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,490
One will deal with the boat later.

223
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,360
I will become the man on whom
everyone can count!

224
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,259
He, Chopper!

225
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,170
How you are
removed from this Priest?

226
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,019
I made use of the whistle.

227
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,380
The Knight of the Sky came to help me.

228
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,680
Where is the odd one the pépé now?

229
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,649
All that because of one
whistle that it gave us,

230
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,270
It fought for us.

231
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,299
If the Knight of
Sky had not come,

232
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,479
the boat and me let us not be
already more this world.

233
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,799
I have full with tricks to ask him,

234
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,199
But that will wait until it awakes.

235
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,010
And thank you with you too.

236
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,080
Luffy!

237
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,480
Considering the state of the boat and
the night which approaches,

238
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,000
we will not be able to turn over
on Angel Island before tomorrow.

239
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,360
For the moment, let us go down in the forest
and let us install the camping on the bank.

240
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,010
Why?

241
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,500
If us here are attacked, the boat
will undergo even more damage.

242
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,020
You should think of this type of things!

243
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,570
Without forgetting that it is easier
to fight on the bank that here.

244
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,419
Of agreement, one camps!

245
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,800
It is the festival!

246
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,669
He, wait!

247
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,119
One is in enemy territory, here!

248
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,469
You want to camp?!

249
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,110
Go, start with one
barbecue of celestial sharks!

250
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,319
They is delicious!

251
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,029
Cretin, would swallow you anything!

252
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,570
He, they is good.

253
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,949
Silence!

254
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,140
We will listen
the report/ratio of each one!

255
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,829
We went in the Forest
Lost, where one fell on…

256
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,749
a Priest called Satori which
made use of Bubble-Surprises.

257
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,650
One galéré with these Bubble-Surprises which floated in the air without knowing what they contained.

258
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,750
But the worst, it was this Mantra which it
used to guess our movements.

259
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,339
A Priest, name of Shura,
emerged from nowhere…

260
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,739
while making use of its
launch which burned all!

261
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,409
Moreover, it could
to envisage my movements.

262
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,579
I tested all
kinds of attacks on him,

263
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,359
But he dodged them.

264
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,619
The bird which it assembled spit of
fire and started to burn the mast…

265
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,570
Then, it impaled
the Knight of the Sky…

266
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,080
You passed dirty
fifteen minutes, the guy.

267
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,730
But, we discovered that this
island was in fact a piece of Jaya.

268
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,809
The Gold City does not have
run at the ocean floor.

269
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,890
It was propelled in the sky!

270
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,410
Good!

271
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,449
Thank you with all for your reports/ratios!

272
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,470
We drew from invaluable
information of all this!

273
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,260
Bird fire-eater! Launch flamer.
The celestial island is in fact what we thought cast,

274
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,620
Jaya!!

275
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,729
The Priests use something called
“Mantra” to envisage our movements.

276
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:34,010
This island is the Gold City that them
Forces Alliées Saruyama sought!

277
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,109
REALLY?!

278
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,930
I have just said it!

279
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,309
If not, it is what this
history of Mantra?

280
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,499
No idea.

281
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,489
Perhaps a species of instinct.

282
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,540
Instinct?

283
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,809
Does Chopper, that suit you like that?

284
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,390
Yes, it is sufficient for
that it can swallow it.

285
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,430
Its digestive system was touched.

286
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,219
Gold, hein?!

287
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,339
It is this kind of adventure
that I waited!

288
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,870
I am in a hurry to be there!

289
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,240
Quite known as! Then one is ready!

290
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,619
He, He, Luffy!

291
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,490
You would have forgotten what
did the warriors say?

292
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,759
God will be furious.

293
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,960
And it is alarming.

294
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,970
One will not be bored, not truth?

295
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,660
Pirates cannot leave
to pass the chance to steal a treasure.

296
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,039
And it is stuffed enemies over there.

297
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,739
It will be necessary to survive.

298
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,190
Ca promises!

299
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
L them guy…

300
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,339
We must be wary of God!

301
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,120
Do not come to feel sorry for you
if you all are damnés!

302
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,099
OK!

303
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,640
HOWEVER, US HERE!

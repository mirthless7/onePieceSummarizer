1
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:06,058
Fortress G8 the steel.

2
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,991
The pirates are not welcome there…

3
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:17,391
If you came, 188 guns would accommodate you.

4
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:22,791
We are proud us,

5
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:28,991
sailors who protect the G8 fortress.

6
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:30,190
But,

7
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:34,524
recently, our fortress was victim of
bad comments near the Navy.

8
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:39,058
He tell that it is the time of peace,
and these funny always disparages the others.

9
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,391
Do not prevent, is necessary to acknowledge that this place does not have
summer attacked by pirates since years.

10
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,658
What?

11
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,125
I did not say anything.

12
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,925
It is right a rumor, a rumor!

13
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,524
Pfff, would be necessary that they will be made look after…!

14
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,657
Peace reigns.

15
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,925
And it is what there is of more important.

16
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:02,658
In fortress G8 the steel…

17
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,591
All is calm, here.

18
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,750
This boat is really badly in point.

19
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,900
If you it to repair, that you
will take at least two weeks.

20
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,790
Me just was however said three days.

21
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,391
Ralala…

22
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:38,258
I think that this boat had to climb the mountains.

23
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,191
It is Mechanic-san?

24
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,257
It is true.

25
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,724
Even by climbing mountains, its state
could not be worse than now.

26
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,790
Ouais, ouais but p' small fireclay cup which it fell from the sky!

27
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,924
Perhaps…

28
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,990
that it was crushed when it crossed the channel.

29
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:57,325
Yes, the channel is narrow.

30
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,325
And it is difficult to cross it.

31
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,924
Good, truce of chattering!

32
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:05,724
We concentrate on our job.

33
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:06,991
Ouais, ouais…

34
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,457
Which waste.

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:16,725
Nowadays, the sailors do not treat
more their boats correctly.

36
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,258
What is there, Mechanic-san?

37
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,190
That fears!!

38
00:04:52,858 --> 00:05:01,190
GENERAL ALARM!
INFILTRATION OF PIRATES!

39
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:10,125
D-of the intruder infiltrated by the sky!

40
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,057
By the sky?

41
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:13,658
NOT SKY?!!

42
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,325
Of the intruders infiltrated!

43
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:27,057
Quickly!

44
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,391
Dépêcnez you to close the channel!

45
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:30,924
You charge with the coast!

46
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:33,058
Units of help, you move!

47
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:35,858
I am still sleepy…

48
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,725
Close the channel!!

49
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,457
By here!

50
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,590
It is by there!!

51
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:08,925
Direct all the projectors by there!!

52
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,657
One… A boat of pirates.

53
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,058
This flag…

54
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:29,125
A tête de mort… with a straw hat…

55
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,991
It is the crew of Cnapeau de Paille!

56
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,058
Q-what?!

57
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,991
Prepare you to draw.

58
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,791
Aim at the boat of Cnapeau de Paille.

59
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,658
Is this the boat of Straw hat?

60
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,125
Allons-y!

61
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:56,924
Major Drake.

62
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:00,225
The intruding boat proves to be that
of the pirate to the Straw hat.

63
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:02,191
Straw hat, you known as?

64
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,725
Where is the commander Jonasan?

65
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,525
It… remains untraceable.

66
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:09,725
Brothel, this type…!

67
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,125
Incredible…

68
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:17,525
They suddenly appeared in the sky…

69
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:34,125
Any resistance is useless!

70
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:38,258
No exit is possible!

71
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,591
“ART CULINAIRE MARINIERE”

72
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:44,525
Made your job!

73
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,491
It is noisy denors and it is only one beginning.

74
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:50,257
Yes.

75
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:52,125
They should negotiate more calmly.

76
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,191
It is hot.

77
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,658
Stop speaking!

78
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,990
Listen!

79
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,125
What we must do, it is to prepare
a good meal for the sailors.

80
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,857
In two hours,

81
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:08,791
the service of night will arrive.

82
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:11,258
There are not time to lose in chatters!

83
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,324
But…

84
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,258
Noise right at the moment…

85
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,524
He the guy, not need to worry.

86
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:22,724
If ever this fortress were brought
to disappear, the world would be already finished.

87
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:26,924
Compared with the anger of Jessica-sama…

88
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,391
“ART CULINAIRE MARINIERE”

89
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,991
Jessica-sama.

90
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,391
What is there?

91
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:35,425
Commander.

92
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,225
Where were you?

93
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:43,525
You did not show yourselves day.

94
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,390
Still today?

95
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,590
However, all went well yesterday.

96
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,724
The subject is not there…

97
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,857
but if the commander is always absent.

98
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:53,590
It is not well?

99
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:56,725
Does that pose a problem?

100
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,990
Commander! There is some cnose
that I must announce you!

101
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,524
The sentinel saw it closely.

102
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,925
One of the sailors informed me…

103
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:08,858
And he said…

104
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,390
What?

105
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:12,258
Speak immediately.

106
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:15,525
Yes, it is that…

107
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,058
They affirm to have seen a phantom.

108
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,590
Thus…

109
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,325
it was a kind of phantom coming from the sky.

110
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,924
It is a flying monster…

111
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:26,925
who jumped right in front of me, and disappeared.

112
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,790
And of the hands… of the hands…

113
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,524
It is what the problem with the hands?

114
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,924
Hands pushed by all
parts of my body.

115
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:36,058
Then I fell and very suddenly darkened.

116
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,258
Yes, they was hands of woman.

117
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,390
That must be…

118
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,258
A GHOST SHIP!!

119
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,790
Stop your stupidities!

120
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:46,390
Yes…

121
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:49,457
This boat belongs, without any doubt,
with the pirates of Cnapeau de Paille.

122
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,124
To say that it is a ghost ship is absurd.

123
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,924
What? And you mentioned that it
had surely fallen from the sky…

124
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,191
Hmm…

125
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,658
They probably came from the sky…

126
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,191
I had said you well that there was one
means of penetrating the fortress.

127
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:12,125
Isn't this? Major…

128
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:19,125
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

129
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:26,125
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

130
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,125
It is that…

131
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,058
A ghost ship…

132
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:53,391
So embaumé.

133
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,192
Commander!

134
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,257
Look at what I found.

135
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,924
An old pure gold diadem.

136
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,858
Which old object.

137
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,192
It perhaps was to fly of the ancient relics.

138
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,457
Autentifiez it immediately!

139
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,192
Yes!

140
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,858
Let us see seeing inside.

141
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:37,724
This noise…

142
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:37,791
Where?

143
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:38,658
Where?

144
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:40,124
Just South-bird.

145
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,391
Be not frightened.

146
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:42,658
South-Bird?

147
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,191
It is because their heads are
always directed towards the south.

148
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,191
They was very invaluable formerly.

149
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:48,458
It is an amusing bird.

150
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,458
Does that go?

151
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,658
It is so wild.

152
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:18,658
All these ustensils are ready with employment.

153
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,725
Books of physics and history.

154
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:27,392
It would seem that the phantoms of
this boat are intellectuals.

155
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:31,525
Which kind of phantoms are they?
It is absurd…

156
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:43,457
Good work, let us seek the phantoms of this boat.

157
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,924
Phantoms of this boat?!

158
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:45,658
Phantoms?!

159
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:46,724
Fan….?!

160
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,124
Phantoms?!

161
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,458
Phantoms of the boat?!

162
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,125
I count on you…

163
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,258
O-Oui!

164
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:58,658
It seems that this boat is
moored in Jaya before.

165
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:00,425
It is acted in fact of the coffee of Jaya.

166
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,025
Yes…

167
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:04,592
According to the color and the odor of the coffee
who were left on board,

168
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,592
It is indeed the coffee of Jaya.

169
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:10,592
That I drank myself without the least
hesitation? What a courage!

170
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:11,857
Heuu in fact…

171
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:16,858
And there is also South-Bird which is one 
bird characteristic of the forests of Jaya.

172
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,125
Comprenenez you?

173
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,525
More especially as it is told that
much gold is hidden over there.

174
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:25,257
Commander, all that to say that this boat…

175
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,324
To know where it went is not used us for nothing.

176
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,000
But it is clear that it comes from Jaya.

177
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,950
It is hardly a ghost ship.

178
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,125
Yes, I already saw it twice before.
It is well that of the Straw hat.

179
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:40,125
But you have just affirmed that
it was a ghost ship.

180
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,258
There are many soldiers and civilians here.

181
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,457
Before we know
the intention of the Straw hat,

182
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,857
it would be their to better hide the truth…

183
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:51,725
the fortress will be in a chaos…

184
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:55,924
It is for that I made them believe
that it was about a ghost ship.

185
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,325
Excuse my manners, Commander,

186
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,225
but do not should not organize to us
a special team

187
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:02,591
for thus capturing them quickly?

188
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,257
We of it are responsible.

189
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,657
Gently.

190
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:06,457
But…

191
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,391
You must reinforce the Monitoring.

192
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:13,058
You, deal with the guard of the channel and the lake.

193
00:14:13,058 --> 00:14:13,992
Yes!

194
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:16,857
You, deal with arms manufacture,
and essence out of equipment.

195
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,924
And you of the main roads occupy.

196
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,391
And of the harmony in the units too.

197
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,858
Included/understood, chief!

198
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,458
You do not approve, Major?

199
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,258
Not.

200
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:28,857
He makes already night, they do not certainly go
not to act now.

201
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:30,792
Toutfois, our situation remains the same one.

202
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:33,124
As of tomorrow morning, your troops would have

203
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,858
chercner a place where
gather many people.

204
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:38,525
The place where everyone gathers…

205
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:39,858
Yes.

206
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:44,057
The green ver de terre is harder
to find in green grass.

207
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:47,125
If pirates of the Straw hat
covered our uniform,

208
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:51,924
one as of theirs could be disguised
in one of my men,

209
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,525
and I could not have completely
confidence in my sailors.

210
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:02,191
These alleged pirates quickly will be famished.

211
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,857
We should find them with jeun with the rising dujour.

212
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:06,658
Yes!

213
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:09,724
The guy…

214
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,792
Where are you?

215
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:18,258
It is what this place…?

216
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,858
Thin!

217
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:32,458
Fortunately that I had this waver.

218
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:46,558
Alarm was given…

219
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:49,058
We must flee quickly from here.

220
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,058
Impossible… There is…

221
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,657
Ah it!

222
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:13,325
We fell to the bad place.

223
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:17,258
I wonder whether Nami-san and Robin-chan
succeeded in fleeing.

224
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,591
What is there?

225
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:25,658
I believed to see a light in the tree.

226
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:29,125
A hallucination?

227
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,592
One cannot smoke even any more quietly.

228
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,325
Ox, pig, chicken.

229
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:57,991
Ox, fish, pig.

230
00:16:57,992 --> 00:16:59,858
Meat! Meat! That meat!

231
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:08,258
I did not eat anything since we are here.

232
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,925
Nothing to make.

233
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:21,858
So only opper was there,
it could feel this aroma.

234
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:32,725
In this case, we cannot
us rapprocner of Merry.

235
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:40,858
Finally we did not find any sailor.

236
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:45,191
But with the fact, these guy of the team of the material
claim to have seen a monster.

237
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,325
Ouais.

238
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:49,324
Even the commander affirmed that it
acted of a ghost ship.

239
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:54,325
It is norrible, being induced with the monitoring
of this terribly empty boat.

240
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,458
It is thus that.

241
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:00,857
The Navy thinks that Merry is a ghost ship.

242
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,925
Ghost ship?

243
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:06,992
J I will teach me to them!

244
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:13,524
However, as long as they believe that, we do not have
no the concern to make us for Merry.

245
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,325
You are of agreement with me, is not this step…?

246
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:16,925
Ouais, Ouais…

247
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,325
I like that better.

248
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:20,791
I see…

249
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:24,524
thus this boat would have been cursed by
the gold stolen among the ancient relics.

250
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,125
In this case,

251
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:29,125
I toucné gold…

252
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:32,792
A hand, this hand!!

253
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:36,591
Luffy with the straw hat… and
the hunter of Zoro pirates.

254
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:41,725
Perhaps that this flying monster and the woman
with the thousand hands are their partners.

255
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,458
L has seven people there.

256
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,192
Among these seven people,

257
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,525
there is a cook chief,

258
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:56,125
a doctor, perhaps even also a historian.

259
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:59,792
Y has something which bell, quickly by here!

260
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:06,525
How this is possible?!

261
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:23,258
How I could land in a similar place?!

262
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,358
- Other side!
- It is included/understood!

263
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,658
Saved!

264
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:51,925
And then?

265
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,792
By where must I go?

266
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:17,458
That then… Whatever the place where one
look at, it does not have no visible exit there.

267
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,457
Raaah…!

268
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:28,658
We fell into an enormous lake without exit.

269
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:41,992
First of all we must find
information to be able to escape to us.

270
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,524
Then Mr. Length-Conk?

271
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,192
I am not enough insane to venture me over there.

272
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:18,925
A hallucination?

273
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:29,125
Which moron, I fear the worst with him.

274
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,592
I do not have the least idea of their goal.

275
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,858
Why are they here?

276
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:52,092
At all events, our fortress is well protected.

277
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:14,258
Wait, it was necessary that one falls
on a basis of the marine?

278
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,391
I am hungry…

279
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:18,791
If one very does not include/understand the EC what it
happens, that is used for nothing to act!

280
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:21,058
Then shows them, which
it is that a chief cook!

281
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,258
It is with me that you say that?

282
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:23,658
I am hungry!!!

283
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,659
Welcome with the fortress of Navarone.

284
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:27,191
It is with me that you say that?
Welcome with the fortress of Navarone.

285
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:28,391
Soon in One Part

286
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:29,524
Sanji the cook!

287
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:31,591
The marine art culinaire!

288
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:33,542
I will become the lord of the pirates!

289
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,942
SANJI THE COOK!
ART CULINAIRE MARINIERE

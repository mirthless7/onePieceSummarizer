1
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:04,050
The Hero of Arabasta

2
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:04,050
And the ballerina on the bridge

3
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,590
Release! Release! Release!

4
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,140
Crocodile-Sama!

5
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,980
Crocodile-Sama!

6
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,900
Crocodile!

7
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,320
Crocodile-Sama!

8
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,740
It came to save us!

9
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,340
Crocodile?

10
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,200
One of Shichibukai…?

11
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,490
Crocodile!

12
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,210
The farm, imbeciles.

13
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,380
I came only for the head from these pirates.

14
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,420
How it is beautiful!

15
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,130
You known as that, but you save us each time!

16
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,010
CROCODILE, BANZAI!

17
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,840
The guard of Arabasta!

18
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,850
Crocodile!

19
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,970
Crocodile!

20
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,220
The King of the desert!

21
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,430
Crocodile!

22
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,230
Good, call me as you want.

23
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,720
However, you will regret having sown the disorder in this country…

24
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,360
Dirty pirates.

25
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
You it pètes not a little?

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,180
You think of being able to all alone beat us all with you?

27
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
You sold your heart with the authorities,
salt dog of the Government!

28
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,200
You seek to do what, by comprising you as hero?

29
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,020
How those which do not want to die hide!

30
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,980
Enough spoken! It is only one boasting!

31
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,630
Kill it!

32
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,900
And all the richnesses of this city will belong to us!

33
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,500
Ouais!

34
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,910
What a terrible Shichibukai!

35
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,830
We really do not play
 in the same category of piracy.

36
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,790
Salt pig.

37
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,280
Crocodile…

38
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,820
Crocodile-Sama…

39
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,310
Crocodile!

40
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,720
Crocodile!

41
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,720
Crocodile!

42
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,730
Crocodile!

43
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,890
Crocodile!

44
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,980
Crocodile!

45
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,150
Crocodile!

46
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,190
Crocodile!

47
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,310
Crocodile!

48
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,150
Crocodile!

49
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,650
Crocodile!

50
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,860
Crocodile!

51
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,780
Crocodile!

52
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,820
Crocodile!

53
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,870
Crocodile!

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,870
Crocodile!

55
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,990
Crocodile!

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,040
Crocodile!

57
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,160
Crocodile!

58
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,120
Crocodile!

59
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,110
Still Crocodile…

60
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,210
Crocodile!

61
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,300
Crocodile!

62
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,870
Kingdom of Arabasta. Palate of Alubarna

63
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,610
It still arrived before you?

64
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,630
Time that our troops arrive at Nanohana,
it had already done the housework.

65
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,010
I see.

66
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,580
It is not serious, since the people are healthy and except.

67
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,550
King d' Arabasta. Nefertari Cobra

68
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,660
We must be to him grateful about it.

69
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,250
There is no doubt on top.

70
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,330
The boat moves right on Arabasta.

71
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,600
I will be soon of return…

72
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,080
Luffy! Do not lie me!

73
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,580
Say to me what you know.

74
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,180
Eh! Why you divert the head?
Look at me!

75
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,110
Not, not! I really do not see what you speak.

76
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,630
Oh, then I you will ask it directly.

77
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,930
How it is made that the vivres planned for us eight
 until our arrival with Arabasta…

78
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,140
… suddenly disappeared in the middle of the night?

79
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,050
Do not try to roll me!

80
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,200
You are a nullity with the poker!

81
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,750
Eh, there is something around your mouth.

82
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,190
Ah, zut! I forgot to wipe me the mouth!

83
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,950
It WAS WELL YOU!!

84
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
Cretin.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,470
Ah, Nami-San.
You saw that?

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,440
My giant trap is not yet rather large!

87
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,150
Perhaps could you buy a lock for the refrigerator to me…

88
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,150
Really…

89
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,870
I will think of it.

90
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,340
After all, our lives surely depend on it.

91
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,120
Well! We must fish fish for Sanji-Kun!

92
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,960
Does Oh, all go well here?

93
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,900
Sure B-Bien!

94
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,570
I see stars…

95
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,560
Good blood, I cannot release you eyes one second.

96
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,170
Ah, I am hungry!

97
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,170
You think that one will be able to catch something in this manner?

98
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,550
Luffy! If nothing is caught, it is because you ate all the worms!

99
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,870
Without soft food, we are not likely to take something!

100
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,600
You of eaten ace, you too!

101
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,600
Euh, only those which were stuck to the lid…

102
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,100
Luffy-San, Usopp-San.
You caught which…

103
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Karu!!

104
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,740
I wonder whether we will catch a shark with that.

105
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,110
I prefer to take a monstre marin!

106
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,280
You…

107
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,390
What do you make… in Karu!?

108
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,640
What is it?

109
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,010
What is it?

110
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,510
If that could be barbe à papa…

111
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,260
I will warn Nami-San.

112
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,630
Nami-San, there is something of odd! Come quickly!

113
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,770
Ah, does not worry you.

114
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,650
It is nothing.

115
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,720
It is a just little vapor.

116
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,200
Vapor which rises ocean?

117
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
Yes, it is a “point chaud”.

118
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,200
It is what that?

119
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,250
It is an exit point of the magma.

120
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,960
At this place, there is an underwater volcano.

121
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,610
There are volcanos even at the bottom of the oceans?

122
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,950
Of course.

123
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,160
Moreover, there is even more at the bottom of the oceans that on the dry land.

124
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,430
Which interest? Ca is not eaten.

125
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,640
If the things remain thus, 
in a few thousands or tens of thousands of years,

126
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,040
… there will be a new island at this place.

127
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,500
You are marvellous, Nami-Chan!

128
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,030
Ten thousand years…

129
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,020
I wonder whether I will be still in life.

130
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,230
Not, you will have died.
You are human.

131
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,470
Still nothing caught?

132
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,950
Oh, Sanji!

133
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,070
I am famished.
Something will prepare me.

134
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,140
You despair me.

135
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,840
Good, I nevertheless will excavate the basic store-room in roof to see whether there is something which trails.

136
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,430
Ca been able sulfur!

137
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,710
I do not see anything! With share of the vapor!

138
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,140
Be patient! One soon will leave there!

139
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,900
Mr. 2, Good Clay-Sama!

140
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,990
What is there!?

141
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,630
Smoke raised at 12 noon!

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,610
No importance!

143
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,970
Continue straight!

144
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,970
In any case, it is necessary that I finish some with Mr. 3 or I will be in danger of death!

145
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,290
We enter the cloud of smoke!

146
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,920
It is what, all this fog?

147
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,380
One does not see any more in front of oneself.

148
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,410
One is come out from it.

149
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,970
Mr. 2, GOOD CLAY-SAMA DISAPPEARED!

150
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,180
Excavate the cabins!

151
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:04,720
He is not there!

152
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,770
Impossible!

153
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,270
Mr. 2, GOOD CLAY-SAMA!!

154
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,410
Oh not!

155
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,700
Why I cling to a giant duck which I have just met!?

156
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,200
U- A siren?

157
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:25,640
Do not think…

158
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,130
Help me! Please!

159
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,420
I am a true anvil, I cannot swim!

160
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,980
On its back:Good Clay

161
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,010
Oh… I believed well that I was going to die, this blow!

162
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,240
In fact not!

163
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,330
Swan, swan.

164
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,330
Swan:Swan

165
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,120
I was saved by pirates whom I do not even know.

166
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,090
I will never forget your kindness!

167
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh, I wondered whether I could have a quite hot soup bowl…

168
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,900
AND THEN WHAT STILL!?

169
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,570
ONE DIES OF HUNGER TOO!

170
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,470
Oh!

171
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,060
How you are nice!

172
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
My pretty small fruit, I would like to devour you well!

173
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,930
Biz'

174
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,750
Which funny of type…

175
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,000
Then, you cannot swim, hein?

176
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,820
It is that.

177
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,220
I ate a Fruit of the Demon.

178
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,960
Ah, and which?

179
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,860
Good…

180
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,030
I imagine that I have a little time before my boat comes to seek me.

181
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,260
I can make you a small demonstration very well.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,900
My skill will impress you!

183
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,130
What is this qu…!?

184
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,170
Wait! Wait! Wait!

185
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,300
I said to you that it was only one demonstration!

186
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,830
No concern!

187
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,700
But it is me!

188
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,770
I had you! I had you! I had you!

189
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,830
It is enough to a small slap of the left hand…

190
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,980
And here, I take again my normal aspect!

191
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,760
It is the capacity which I acquired by eating the “Basket Basket Fruit”!

192
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,760
Basket:Imitation

193
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,150
Its voice…

194
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,640
And even its attitude are identical!

195
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,070
TOO MUCH COOL!!

196
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,180
In fact, I do not need to type very extremely.

197
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,870
He! Look at!

198
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,330
If I touch my face…

199
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,790
… of the right hand…

200
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,360
… I can imitate no matter whom…

201
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,780
It is as simple as that!

202
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,550
Ca also goes for the body, of course!

203
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,620
Ca is enough!

204
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,590
Does Eh, that go?

205
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,810
Good,

206
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,460
I believe well that I can nothing show you moreover, unfortunately…

207
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,460
Be incredible for you! Still!

208
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,610
Ah, I do not have the choice!

209
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,190
Since you insist!

210
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,910
Go ahead! Go ahead!

211
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,160
He likes to be made wish.

212
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,580
Well, well, I will show you something of other!

213
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,290
My storage capacity!

214
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,790
Loan?

215
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,340
It is too odd, that one!

216
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,550
And that one then?

217
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,980
It is too well!

218
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,890
It is shitting.

219
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,100
Then, you found that well?

220
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,940
I do not show it with everyone.

221
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,280
It was giant!

222
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,640
Do not flatter me! Do not flatter me!

223
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,460
It tears! It tears! It tears!

224
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,860
They saoulent me.

225
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,140
It tears! It tears! It tears!

226
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,450
Hold, it is my boat.

227
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,010
It is largest! It is largest!

228
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,500
It is the moment to say itself goodbye.

229
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,700
It is well damage.

230
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,850
Please, do not leave!

231
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,790
Do not be sad!

232
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,870
Separations form also part of the voyages!

233
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,980
But do not forget this:

234
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,920
In a true friendship,

235
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,700
time does not have any importance!

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,230
Do not cry me!

237
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,420
ONE SE WILL RE-EXAMINE!

238
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,310
Good, the guy, is necessary to go there!

239
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,590
Yes, Mr. 2, Good Clay-Sama!

240
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,190
Mr. 2!?

241
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,820
It was him… Mr. 2 Good Clay!

242
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,610
Vivi didn't, you recognize it!?

243
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,770
Not, I had never met Mr. 2 or the partner of Mr. 1 before…

244
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
… I do not even know their capacities!

245
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,430
I had some rumors of course…

246
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,490
Mr. 2…

247
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,210
They said that Mr. 2 was an extravagant ballerina with the voice engraves…

248
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,670
… which carries a coat to the pace of swan…

249
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,830
… with the back of which one can read “Good Clay”.

250
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,270
Could you have collected.

251
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,340
Does Y' have something which does not go, Vivi?

252
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,560
Among the memorized faces which it showed…

253
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,970
… there was the face of my father!

254
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,960
The face of King d' Arabasta, Nefertari Cobra…

255
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,090
If it can be made pass for the King…

256
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,100
it is certainly not with a charitable aim.

257
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,240
One has just let leave a dangerous guy.

258
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,530
It is an enemy?

259
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,050
He will pose certainly problem if he is being our enemy.

260
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,830
When it realizes that we are enemy…

261
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,940
… it will be able to use its capacity to be made pass for one of us.

262
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,960
Then we will not be able any more to trust us.

263
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,350
And then?

264
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,380
Listen to me, Luffy…

265
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,470
Wait a little.

266
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,950
Although this type does not have anything on what to found its opinion,

267
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,290
it rightly by saying that we should not fear this guy.

268
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,150
I think that it is a chance to have met him.

269
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,690
We can now envisage a response?.

270
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,660
One, two, three!

271
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,660
Mr. 2 Good Clay-Sama.

272
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,930
How are four said?

273
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,930
You seem to be of good mood.

274
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,840
I was made new friends!

275
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,930
This trick is enormous!

276
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,140
Chacalot!

277
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,010
A monster of the seas!

278
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,160
OUR FIRST MEAL IN FOUR DAYS!

279
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,620
WITH TABLE!

280
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,860
The course is good!

281
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,660
I would like to be already there.

282
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,980
PUFFS OUT!

283
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,250
Eh, it is run away!

284
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,250
Is necessary to continue it!
BEHIND! BEHIND!

285
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,000
C-C-like if it were possible!

286
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,400
Do not let it leave! Catch it!

287
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,820
You ace interest to be edible, salts monster!

288
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,890
STOP!

289
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,930
Vivi did, what take to you!?

290
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,810
For Why? Vivi-Chan…

291
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,630
You should not eat it!

292
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,350
For people of Arabasta, it is a crowned creature!

293
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,600
You could not say it earlier?

294
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,890
Do the oceans abound in surprises, hein?

295
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,140
You ace to learn still much if this trick you frightened ace.

296
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,740
Yosh.

297
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,640
And if I told you the time where I cut down some of these monsters in Calm Belt.

298
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,230
Monstres marins!?

299
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,420
And not small.

300
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,280
Y' had heaps of them!

301
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,470
My meal was made the trunk…

302
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,790
Do not worry you…

303
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,160
Soon, you will be able to eat as much as you want.

304
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,830
REALLY!?

305
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,880
Which kind of cat it will be, this time?

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,390
Vivi, the wind and the climate seem to be stabilized.

307
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,100
Yes, we entered the climatic zone of Arabasta.

308
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,140
The presence of Chacalot confirms it.

309
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,360
I bet that what there is behind us…

310
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,210
… is an additional proof of the proximity of Arabasta.

311
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,920
All these boats! When are they…?

312
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,450
Oh! They carry all the emblem of Works Baroque!

313
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,110
They start to gather.

314
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,180
They are certainly the “Billions”.

315
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,920
They are under the orders of the “Agents Officers”.

316
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,390
They are at least two hundreds…

317
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,010
Moreover, they form the elite of Works Baroque.

318
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,570
They are quite higher than the bargain hunters of Whiskey Peak.

319
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,730
In this case, let us open fire as long as we can it!

320
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,820
LET US STOP QUICKLY!

321
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,680
Not, it is faster to sink to them above and to put to them pâtée!
ALLONS-Y!

322
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,150
Not, wait… most important is until I eat initially!

323
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
Imbeciles, stop panicking!

324
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,090
It is only small fry.

325
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,130
It is true. One should not lose sight of the fact our true objective.

326
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,550
We are only eight, do not forget it.

327
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,330
Well, be certain to have tightened it well.

328
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,970
We are unaware of still many things about our enemies.

329
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,380
Well considering.

330
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,110
With this sign, we will not have any problem to identify us quickly.

331
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,290
It was so much resembling?

332
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,770
When it used the capacity of the “Basket Basket Fruit”?

333
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,170
It is more than one simple resemblance…

334
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,500
… he was us!

335
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,070
Should to you have seen that!

336
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,730
One even danced with him!

337
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,640
The male ballet dancers do not interest me.

338
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,940
Knowing that there is a similar type at the enemy…

339
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,740
… we should not act individually.

340
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,840
And me? What do I have to make?

341
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,350
Do of tone better!

342
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,170
It is not worthwhile to make some more than you can it!

343
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,090
It is normal to flee an enemy whom you cannot beat!

344
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,460
To do my utmost…

345
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Heard!

346
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,820
The island is in sight!

347
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,900
We will stop in the port of Nanohana.

348
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,370
We will be able to hide the boat there.

349
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,880
Well! No matter what it arrives from now on…

350
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,820
… this mark on our left arm…

351
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,910
… is the badge of our friendship!

352
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,060
And now, with us dry land!

353
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,640
Towards a restaurant! Oh and afterwards, Arabasta…

354
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,940
Revise your priorities.

355
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,950
We will face a herd of assassins, Luffy.

356
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,300
Ah, it is true.

357
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,330
Thus acted not according to your instincts! Included/understood?

358
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,950
Ouais, it is of agreement.

359
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,790
I included/understood, I included/understood!

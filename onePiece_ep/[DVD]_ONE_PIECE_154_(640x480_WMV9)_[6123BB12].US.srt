1
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,380
What goes it
to happen?

2
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,750
This belt of clouds
resemble a river.

3
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,650
Ah, Nami-san! Mellorine!

4
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,750
Ca cannot be the work of nature…
Ah, Nami-san! Mellorine!

5
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,850
Ca does not have anything naturalness!

6
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,060
The exit!

7
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,770
There is a sign!

8
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,210
“Godland”.

9
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,490
“Country of God, Skypiea”!

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,980
It is not an exit!

11
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,680
It IS an ENTRY!

12
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:56,360
Divine Earth of Skypiea!
Angels of the beach of cloud

13
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,820
An island!

14
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,230
It IS the CELESTIAL ISLAND!

15
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,810
Said…

16
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,850
This sign said… Skypiea.

17
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,530
Yes!

18
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,020
The same name as that registered
on the chart found by Luffy!

19
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,340
The wreck which fell to us above…

20
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,370
… had come well up to now!

21
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,850
They contemplated the same one
thing two hundred years earlier!

22
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,750
It is what this place?

23
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,320
Ca feels the adventure!

24
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,850
Wait, cretin!

25
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,970
It is not deep, one has foot.

26
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,640
He, nothing of broken?

27
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,960
Usopp!

28
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,440
This island is made
of this marrowy cloud?

29
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,090
One would say well!

30
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,840
It is the marrowy cloud!

31
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,510
One unloads!

32
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,650
Celestial island!

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,940
Me also, me too!

34
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,880
I will change!

35
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,870
He, Luffy!

36
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,610
What does one make for the anchor?

37
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,590
There is not basic here, it is that?

38
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,570
One card-indexes oneself some, not?

39
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,990
Ouais, one is card-indexed some!

40
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,090
One card-indexes oneself some?

41
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,950
Take that!

42
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,950
Take that!

43
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,630
Me also, me too!

44
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,120
Take that!

45
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,770
He, come!

46
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,980
This beach is marrowy!

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,980
Roll!

48
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,320
Let test to me!

49
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,380
And Ben, this landscape is
rather astonishing nevertheless.

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,500
One would believe to dream.

51
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,330
Ouais, you said it.

52
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,710
Look at gallopping them like kids…

53
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,210
They are irremediable.

54
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,260
You can speak.

55
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,280
Afflicted! I excuse myself!

56
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,690
One took along the Bird of the South with us.

57
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,740
One forgot to slacken it.

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,890
It would seem that people live here.

59
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,950
Y' does not have to worry for him.

60
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,120
The birds can manage.

61
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,830
Yes, it is true.

62
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,240
You dropped anchor?

63
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,430
It is wedged in the cloud.

64
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,470
They are these bulky clouds
who support this island.

65
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,940
Then that means that the island
float on this sea…

66
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,900
But I wonder whether it
never change place.

67
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,330
Bah, one will see well.

68
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,450
All really seems
difficult to believe, here.

69
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,700
But one can at least be sure
to be arrived on the celestial island.

70
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,640
Look at!

71
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,860
I am me there too!

72
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,810
There is not what to be afraid!

73
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,380
Come with us!

74
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,790
Ca will be better when you
will have posed your feet above!

75
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,770
And you?

76
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,940
Ouais, I arrive.

77
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,310
The perfume of the adventure…

78
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,100
To sail and explore,
it is that the adventure.

79
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,070
I had never found
that exciting before.

80
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,790
The celestial island would be
perfect for a nap…

81
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,870
Ah, here the Captain.

82
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,940
Y' has funny tricks so much with
to make, I donot can by what start!

83
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,500
Finished!

84
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,060
Here Usopp!

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,530
And if one took holidays here?

86
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,380
Finished!

87
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,780
Holidays?

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Ca sounds well!

89
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,470
Negative!

90
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,890
Negative?! Ca wants to say not!

91
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,620
Hold, it is well
strange flower which pushes here.

92
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,980
These sheets resemble balloons.

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,080
They will explode
like this octopus?

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,850
What a happiness!

95
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,140
The navy will not come
us to seek up to now!

96
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,060
One will be able to release itself a little!

97
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,850
He, Chopper, look at!

98
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,980
What is it according to you?

99
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,850
Funny of fruit!

100
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,550
Good appetite!

101
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,380
It is what this trick?!

102
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
It is too hard!

103
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,140
He, Usopp!

104
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,840
You want fruits? Catches!

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,810
Ca hurts, cretin!

106
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,040
Wait a little, you will see!

107
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,540
Ah, Robin-chwan!

108
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,830
A flower of the celestial island
only for you!

109
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,510
For Robin-chan.

110
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,090
And the other…

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,740
NAMI SWAN!

112
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,810
NAMI-SWAN!

113
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,090
MT FLEUR!

114
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,240
They are also made in cloud!

115
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,210
I imagine that they can manufacture
heaps of things containing cloud.

116
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,260
But it is not like
marrowy clouds.

117
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,960
NAMI SWAN! MT FLEUR!

118
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,260
It is well stuffed.

119
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,250
How can one wet them
feet in a sea of clouds?

120
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,140
Oh, perfect.

121
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,970
Afflicted!

122
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,640
It is what, that? A fox?

123
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,060
Music?

124
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,980
He!

125
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,820
Y' has somebody!

126
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,710
On top!

127
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,600
Still this warrior?!

128
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,300
The whistle!

129
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,090
Quickly, whistles!

130
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,690
That it flies to our help!

131
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,770
Not, wait!

132
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,960
It is not him.

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,570
It is…

134
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,050
an angel!

135
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,940
An angel?

136
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,190
Heso.

137
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,300
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

138
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,810
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

139
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Heso! Heso?
[Note:Heso = Navel]

140
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,900
She really said… “heso”?

141
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,670
Ouais…

142
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,160
Does Ca want to say what “heso”?

143
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,780
Not, “heso” it is the navel.

144
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,980
Come here, Suu!

145
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,970
You come from the blue sea?

146
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,040
Ouais, one comes from in bottom.

147
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,140
You live here?

148
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,970
Indeed.

149
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,100
Welcome on the Beach
angels of Skypiea.

150
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,750
Do you want to taste that?

151
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,810
Ouais…

152
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,730
The hull of the conashe is
last like steel.

153
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,570
One cannot crunch it.

154
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Therefore, by in lower part…

155
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,260
And here.

156
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,680
It is too booooon!

157
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,110
Did Ah ouais? they is good?

158
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,380
Make taste, make taste!

159
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,350
It is boooon!

160
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,080
I am called Conis.

161
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,790
And here Suu, a fox of the clouds.

162
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,950
If you wish anything,
I will be happy to help you.

163
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,800
Well, on this subject…

164
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,950
Your glance transpierced my heart…

165
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,920
Move from there!

166
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,860
We have much of
questions to pose to you.

167
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,490
All here seems to us so strange.

168
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,150
Of course. Ask what you want.

169
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,230
He, Something arrives.

170
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,450
Ah, it is my father.

171
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,490
Conis-san, heso!

172
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,980
Yes! Heso, father!

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,850
Heu… About what do speak you, the guy?

174
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,540
What is what it is that?

175
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,840
This thing which it overlaps.

176
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,890
Do Ah, you speak about Waver?

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,730
They is too cool!

178
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,670
Waver…

179
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,890
Yes, excuse me!

180
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,290
I stop immediately!

181
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,790
Is nobody wounded?

182
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,230
AND YOU THEN!?

183
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,130
He, Luffy.

184
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,790
This machine does not resemble
that which you did fish out?

185
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,120
If, at bottom.

186
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,610
It was thus that the boat which sails without
wind about which Norland in its newspaper spoke!

187
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,100
They are your friends, Conis-san?

188
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,720
Yes, one has just met.

189
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,340
They came from the Blue Sea.

190
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,640
Thus hold.

191
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,080
Ca had to be a difficult voyage.

192
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,180
This is the Sea of Opal. Forgive me.

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,830
O-Oh not, it is nothing.

194
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,110
I did not present myself.

195
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,610
I am called Pagaya. All my excuses.

196
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,210
Not, no problem.

197
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,190
Father, did you fish fish?

198
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,150
Yes, a good catch.

199
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,860
With the fact, which you would say
to pass at home?

200
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,990
You will be entitled to all
celestial hospitality.

201
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,970
One can?

202
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,380
One goes there! One goes there!

203
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,930
Kitchen of the celestial island?

204
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,910
Could I help you to prepare it?

205
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,610
But front, I can you
to ask something?

206
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,620
It… does not have a veil
to take the wind…

207
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,050
And you did not row with…

208
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,220
How can it advance on water?

209
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,490
Don't Oh, you know Dials?

210
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,030
Dials?

211
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,840
PPP that moves
in all the directions?!

212
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,350
Ca does not want to stop!!

213
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,060
Oh my god!

214
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,130
I hope that it is not wounded!

215
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,130
What a tragedy!

216
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,740
Afflicted, I would not have
to lend my Waver to him!

217
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,700
With the fact, which it arrives to the people
equipped with capacities in this sea?

218
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,580
Good question.

219
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,910
Is this sea different, not?

220
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,350
Perhaps that it will be left there.

221
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,040
It ran.

222
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,060
Does Ca fear, not?

223
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,400
OH NOT!!

224
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,540
He Ben…

225
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,890
A little more and it fell into the vacuum!

226
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,490
The fault with which?! It is you
who remained planted with papoter!!

227
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,410
That is what has you
taken to plunge too?

228
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,970
The alarming celestial island…
the alarming celestial island…

229
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,610
It is of my fault, I have
let a beginner borrow it.

230
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,230
The hull of Waver is very light.

231
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,150
Even a small wave can
to make move the rudder.

232
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,650
It is necessary well to know
sea to be able to control it.

233
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,270
I am sorry.

234
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,610
I hardly start
with knowing to be useful to me about it.

235
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,890
It is so difficult?

236
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,590
Ten should be counted
years of training.

237
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,100
Name of god!

238
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,330
IT ARRIVES THERE!

239
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,420
It is brilliant!

240
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,690
Nami-san! You are the best!!

241
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,390
Oh my god! Here are which is surprising!

242
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,840
I have evil to believe my eyes of them!

243
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,990
How can it control this trick?!

244
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,930
It is not easy to take in hand!

245
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,800
It is well too delicate
for you, Luffy!

246
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,190
He, Nami!

247
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,580
One goes to pépé!

248
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,720
Go down from there immediately!

249
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,820
IDIOT!!

250
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,240
He do not speak like that!

251
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,870
IDIOT!!

252
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,870
Leave in front!

253
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,640
[Note:“O-jisan” means “uncle” but that can too
to designate the men of more than 35 years as it is the case here.]

254
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,630
O-jisan, I Can
to control still a little?

255
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,640
Yes, but would be careful!

256
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,940
A boat which can split them
floods without worrying about the wind! My dream!

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,910
I wonder whether it goes
on our seas with us!

258
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,650
He, it is a building site
of construction that?

259
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh, it is the career of clouds.

260
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,820
It is here that we extract them
clouds necessary to our constructions.

261
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,300
You really can
to cut out clouds?

262
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,360
To come to the Sea from Opal…

263
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,520
you took Milky
Isn't Road?

264
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,910
Milky Road?

265
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,120
You want to speak about this
cloudy snail road?

266
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,320
It was manufactured to leave
clouds cut out here.

267
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,730
There exist two kinds
natural clouds.

268
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,790
Those on which you arrived
in boat are océonimbus.

269
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,010
And those, more marrowy, on
which you could walk…

270
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,940
are ilonimbus.

271
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
It would be impossible
with normal clouds.

272
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,920
Yes, the process of condensation
of each cloud is different.

273
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,990
[Kairouseki:“marine granite”)]

274
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,590
In the Blue Sea, there exists one
matter called Kairouseki, not true?

275
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,990
Kairouseki?

276
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,610
But there is a relationship with that?

277
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:42,080
Yes, one finds it in Pyrobloïne, a particle
of sulfur transported in the airs by the volcanos.

278
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,070
And once charged with water, the difference in pressure determines if in fact ilonimbus or océonimbus will be created.

279
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,910
Oh, Ben ouais, of course!

280
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,160
Yes, yes, I know already all that.

281
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,280
I played already with these particles
of sulfur when I was kid.

282
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,860
BEN LET US SEE!

283
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,710
Lastly, in short…

284
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,920
The clouds which you find here
are océonimbus, ilonimbus…

285
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,070
like those manufactured
starting from the ilonimbus.

286
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,880
We are there.

287
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,550
What a seen splendid!

288
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,970
I manage to see Nami on Waver!

289
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,260
He, Luffy!

290
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
What do you make?

291
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,230
This Nami…

292
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,170
Why it arrives there so easily?

293
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,440
RUN!!

294
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,240
Cretin!

295
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,790
To me am bitten the language, Sanji!

296
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,120
Heu, grandfather…

297
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,220
Where is the kitchen?

298
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,530
Yes, it is by there.

299
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,740
Doesn't something go?

300
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,090
Not, I had never seen that front
then I wanted to taste a little…

301
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,220
Ben, that tears off serious!

302
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,390
This… sauce color blue sky.

303
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,460
My language is all engourdie…

304
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,840
It is mildewed. I am sorry.

305
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,760
THEN DO NOT LET IT TRAIL!

306
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,460
I swallowed a spoon
whole of this trick!

307
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,700
I am sorry. You cut yourselves?

308
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,600
It would be said that he has fun.

309
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,700
It is insane in front of joy
refined celestial kitchen.

310
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,640
NOT!

311
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,610
Even if we come
to arrive, Miss…

312
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:10,700
Could you say some to us more to the subject
of these Dials about which you did speak to us?

313
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,390
Of course.

314
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,300
Let us see seeing…

315
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,030
How to say…?

316
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,770
Ahh… Which pleasant
and marrowy armchair.

317
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,580
It is what, that?

318
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,640
Does Y' have shells here?

319
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,440
Yes. Try to say
something inside.

320
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,030
Ok!

321
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,930
Usopp is an badger!

322
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,820
For… For… Why you say that?

323
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,630
And now, press
the top of the shell.

324
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,190
It is what a top?

325
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,090
Top of the shell!

326
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,690
“Usopp is an badger!”

327
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,490
“For… For… Why you say that?”

328
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,490
AH! SHELL SE
FOUT OF the MOUTH Of USOPP!

329
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,990
And with your voice!

330
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,210
“And now, press
the top of the shell. “

331
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,120
He, it is not badly that.

332
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,080
Ca recorded the sound.

333
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,610
This shell is Dial?

334
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,810
Yes, it is a “Audio-Dial”.

335
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,500
It can record and rejouer sounds.

336
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,820
It is one of the shells
sea of Opal.

337
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,230
However, this sea does not have basic.

338
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,940
Where do these shells live?

339
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,400
On the reefs of not very deep water.

340
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,600
But I do not see how
that can propel Waver.

341
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,110
Yes. Propulsion of
Waver comes from that one.

342
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,620
It is not very large, but the principle
is the same one as for the Audio-Dial.

343
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,530
The wind leaves this one then!

344
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,860
Give to see!

345
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,580
It is a Breath-Dial.

346
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,000
He aspires the wind and slackens then it.

347
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,030
The capacity varies according to the size…

348
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,480
But by putting it at the back of a boat,
it can move small boats.

349
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,160
It is thus that Waver.

350
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,360
I include/understand.

351
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Then that blew of
air to move it.

352
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,120
Brilliant this Waver!

353
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,460
In fact, there is the different one too.

354
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,460
Of Skate-Dials
and of Board-Dials.

355
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,160
But Waver is it
only that I control.

356
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,340
I want to test it!

357
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,630
What a chance it has!

358
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,510
And one has some too!

359
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,510
You found Waver?

360
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,370
Ouais, finally by chance.

361
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,670
One found of them an old man very dented.

362
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,010
But after two hundred years,
he must function more.

363
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,240
Eh well, not necessarily.

364
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,480
Dials are made leave
remainders of shells.

365
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,460
As long as their shell
is not broken…

366
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,590
They will be almost
always functional.

367
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,780
Hear you that?

368
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,090
But you cannot still lead it.

369
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,850
Let dream to me…

370
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,380
I bet that it in
exist other kinds.

371
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,390
Is that one too?

372
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,770
Yes, this is a Lamp-Dial.

373
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,770
Oh, the shell shines!

374
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,850
There is also which
aspire fire, the Flame-Dial.

375
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,900
And another which aspires scents
and flavors, Aroma-Dial.

376
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,100
And still another which reflects
images, Visio-Dial.

377
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,090
There is of all kinds.

378
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,500
They is too cool…

379
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,300
They is too cool!

380
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,730
They form integral part of
our daily celestial life.

381
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,500
I see.

382
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,830
Thus, culture of the celestial island…

383
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,020
… evolved/moved with the energy of Dials.

384
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,160
Here, it is ready!

385
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,640
Specialities of the celestial island
with fruit trimming!

386
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,830
Ca with the succulent air!

387
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,290
Brilliant!

388
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,320
They is extra!

389
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,320
It is a super presentation
for shrimp!

390
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,640
They is too good!

391
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,980
He!

392
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,500
Where did Nami-san pass?

393
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,960
It is over there in the sea.

394
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,860
Not, it is not there.

395
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,480
It is probably
part to explore then.

396
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,580
It knows what it does.

397
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,170
Father, goes it
to leave itself there?

398
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,480
Yes, Conis-san… I am not
not quiet me either.

399
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,740
What? Does Y' have a problem?

400
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,940
It is in Skypiea a prohibited necessary where,
no matter what it arrives, no one should not penetrate.

401
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,090
It is very close to here.
In Waver, one is there in one moment.

402
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,040
They are immense…

403
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,040
What is it?

404
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,270
One should never put at it
feet… And why that?

405
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,770
It is a crowned ground.

406
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,170
A crowned ground?

407
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,740
This ground is called…

408
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,490
[Note:Upper Yard =
The higher garden]

409
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,490
The Field of God, “Upper Yard”.

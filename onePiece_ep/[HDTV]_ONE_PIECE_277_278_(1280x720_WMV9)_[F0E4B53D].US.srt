1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:10,740
Robin!

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,260
Robin-chan!

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,560
W-Where have you been?

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,810
We've been searching for you!

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,280
I won't...

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,530
...be coming back to you anymore.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,620
This is farewell.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,890
Here, in this city.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,280
This can't be...

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,560
There is a darkness inside of me which is unknown to you.

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,700
This darkness will eventually destroy you.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,060
I wasn't searching for the Poneglyphes in order to revive the weapons...

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,150
Rather, I only wanted to know the history.

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,000
That's complete nonsense!

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,060
Even when faced with the destiny of Ohara's demons,
 you still long to know the history!?

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,510
What do you know about Ohara!?

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,220
The life I once threw away...

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,870
The heart I'd lost...

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,390
The dream I stopped chasing after...

20
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,060
They saved all of it!

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,020
I found nakama...

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,270
...who could believe in someone like me.

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,240
Then...

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,130
Your dream is...?

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,420
That the six Straw Hats, excluding me, leave this island safely!

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,980
Just for that, you don't care about what will happen to the world when the ancient weapons are revived!?

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,840
I don't.

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:50,490
Ah, speaking of which, we just got some news.

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,660
I received a report that says these idiots,

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,050
the ones who invaded this place just to get you back, are here.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,250
Impossible...

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,610
What!?

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,720
Every single one of them should've been captured by now.

34
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,020
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,290
What stubborn people they are...

36
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,310
They're just like small bits of garbage, in front of the ten thousand Marines of Enies Lobby.

37
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,580
Wait!

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,420
Isn't this different to our agreement!?

39
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,800
The condition for me to collaborate with you was to let them get away safely!

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,860
Didn't they set off from Water 7 safely and then come here?

41
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,780
ROBIIIIN!!

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,020
I CAME TO BRING YOU BACK!!

43
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,880
Leave the rest to us!

44
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,190
Has a request for the Buster Call been made yet?

45
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,060
We're still on standby.

46
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,740
Hurry!

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,890
Escape to the evacuation ship!

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,770
Is this the so-called Poneglyph?

49
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,210
Yeah...

50
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,540
Whatever we do, even setting explosions around it, won't leave any damage.

51
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,420
This is a disgusting stone.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,220
And these are scattered all over the world?

53
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,440
Is that so?

54
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,110
Yes.

55
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,700
This is a capital crime.

56
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,490
We've gotten hold of all the evidence we needed,

57
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,990
we're only waiting for your order.

58
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,700
This can't be helped.

59
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,540
This is truly a deplorable result,

60
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,500
but they've broken the world's law.

61
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,460
We can't let them get away with this.

62
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,630
I've had enough, stop with the small talk...

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,710
Gorousei.

64
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,170
How rude of you, low life!

65
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,840
You're talking to the person holding the highest political power in the world!

66
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,810
So you're the authority of archaeology, Professor Clover of Ohara...

67
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,430
You're a great contributor to the world's cultural heritage.

68
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,980
I know your name well.

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,020
To think a man like you would stray from the righteous path...

70
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,280
The past belongs to all of mankind.

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,950
Nobody has any right...

72
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,450
...to try and stop the desire to know the untold history.

73
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,240
Professor!

74
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,200
If someone reads the Poneglyphes,

75
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,580
the possibility to revive the ancient weapons will arise,

76
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,500
bringing a great deal of danger to the world.

77
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,250
Even if the case is that you don't have any ill intentions, if someone desires to use them to a villainous end,

78
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,090
the situation will be the same.

79
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,840
Whatever the past may be,

80
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,550
as long as it's history crafted by the hands of mankind,

81
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,470
we have the responsibility to accept it all.

82
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
If one is able to understand this without fear,

83
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,180
countermeasures will be possible whatever happens.

84
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,600
That is an idealistic argument.

85
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,060
I wonder about that.

86
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,610
Isn't the idea of it being impossible simply suited to your purpose?

87
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,490
Of all the truths remaining in the world nowadays,

88
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,160
the ones we want to know the most are the engraved messages of the Poneglyphes...

89
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,830
...and the reason of their existence.

90
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,950
Why did people of the past carve their messages on hard stone...

91
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,790
...in an attempt to transmit it to the future?

92
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,170
They engraved history on unbreakable stones and dispersed them throughout the world.

93
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,550
Wasn't it because they feared having their message destroyed,

94
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,220
if they were to lay it on paper or in books?

95
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,640
In brief...

96
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,980
This is evidence that the people who left this behind had a clear enemy.

97
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,900
What are you trying to say, Professor Clover?

98
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,280
If we consider the other possibility of these people being defeated by some enemy,

99
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,870
then that enemy should have survived and stayed in the history.

100
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,290
Oddly enough...

101
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,870
Eight hundred years ago,

102
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,960
just as the Void Century finally came to a close,

103
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,340
the organization known as the World Government was created.

104
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,220
If the enemy of the fallen people was today's World Government,

105
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,300
then we can come to a conclusion,

106
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,520
that the Void Century is inconvenient history that was erased by the hands of the World Government.

107
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,360
By reading historical documents from that time and by deciphering a certain number of Poneglyphes,

108
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,110
we noticed the existence of a country before too long.

109
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,450
What these texts revealed to us was the shape of a powerful country.

110
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,120
It once took pride in its enormous strength,

111
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,120
but all information on that country has been completely erased.

112
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,590
It's very probable that when they realized the deeds of an allied nation,

113
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,460
referred to as the World Government,

114
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,930
they carved the truth on stones, in order to entrust their ideas to the future.

115
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,020
These are the Poneglyphes that remained in this world to this day.

116
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,020
I see.

117
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,810
This is an audacious hypothesis.

118
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,310
The ancient weapons will indeed coerce the world.

119
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,190
But more importantly, won't the existence and ideas of that country,

120
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,650
being revealed along with the true history,

121
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,620
be even more of a menace to you, the World Government?

122
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,870
We must make clear the nature of this menace,

123
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,880
but what holds the key to solving everything is the name of that once flourishing country...

124
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,260
KILL HIM!

125
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,600
Professor!

126
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:55,940
Ohara has...

127
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,780
Bastards!

128
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
How could you!?

129
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,950
Professor!

130
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,990
...learnt too much.

131
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,620
Give the order to attack.

132
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,500
Shit...!

133
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,170
Don't move, fiends!

134
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,880
Professor!

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
You mustn't let anyone escape.

136
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,140
Then, with this Golden Den-Den Mushi, that Admiral Sengoku entrusted unto me...

137
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,230
Professor?

138
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,350
Robin...

139
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,140
Idiot...

140
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,810
You shouldn't be here...

141
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,810
Run!

142
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,480
I'll engage the Buster Call!

143
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,860
Take care of this.

144
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,990
He did something!

145
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,780
That guy...!

146
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,990
Hurry to the evacuation ship, Robin!

147
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,370
No! I don't want to be alone!

148
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,040
Don't say silly things...

149
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,540
At such a time...

150
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,080
Robin...

151
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,050
This is the request for the Buster Call!

152
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,130
All ships, get ready!

153
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,550
Prepare for attack!

154
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,800
Hey!

155
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,640
This is...!

156
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,430
The Tree of Omniscience is on fire!

157
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,100
Hey!

158
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,060
What is this for, World Government!?

159
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,860
You should have had enough with just our heads!

160
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,900
I don't know.

161
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,490
That explosion earlier must have started a fire.

162
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,120
Don't take us for fools!

163
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,490
You don't know how important the documents in there are!

164
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:29,700
Hey!

165
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,540
Don't move!

166
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,160
It's alright, no need for guns anymore.

167
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,540
Government officials retreat.

168
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,670
The books, hurry...

169
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,260
Extinguish the fire in the library!

170
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,720
Hurry!

171
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,980
Pass the water here!

172
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,980
Carry the books outside the library!

173
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,120
We're bringing that woman along.

174
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:17,960
Come...

175
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,260
There's still information only she knows.

176
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,630
We can't have her die here.

177
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,100
Mama!

178
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,270
Robin...

179
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,150
Please... Run away quickly...

180
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,480
You absolutely must not die...

181
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,150
Mama, mama!

182
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,370
Robin, hurry!

183
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,030
Get out of here immediately...

184
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,040
Robin-chan!

185
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,540
Robin...

186
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,340
Are you...

187
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,590
...my mother?

188
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,980
Olvia, are you getting aboard or not!?

189
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,100
Mama!

190
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,730
I'm holding her back, so quickly leave!

191
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,020
Mama, don't go!

192
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,530
Mama!

193
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,730
Mama!

194
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,360
Mama!

195
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,700
I'm sorry, Robin...

196
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,700
I can't call myself a mother anymore.

197
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,450
I can't be forgiven now...

198
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,160
I can't be a mother...

199
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,380
Monster!

200
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,670
Monster!

201
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,220
She was thrown away by her mother you know!

202
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,390
Robin, that's my daughter's dress!

203
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,470
Obasan = Aunt

204
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,470
I'm sorry, obasan!

205
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,890
I only wanted to try it on!

206
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,980
She eats a lot! Even though she's a freeloader.

207
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,530
Are you...

208
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,160
...my mother?

209
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,710
What is it?

210
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,960
You had a kid?

211
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,250
No.

212
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
Olvia-san...

213
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,590
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,550
I think you have...

215
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,390
...the wrong person.

216
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,770
Forgive me, Robin.

217
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,100
I don't want you to become the daughter of a criminal!

218
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,600
Olvia...

219
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,020
Weirdo brat.

220
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Come on, let's get going.

221
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,330
I'm Robin!

222
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,500
I've grown a lot!

223
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,670
Don't you remember me?

224
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,510
I've always been waiting for your return!

225
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,180
Are you...

226
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,220
...really not...

227
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,930
...my mother?

228
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,640
Someday...

229
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,310
I wanted to walk together with you,

230
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,320
while holding hands!

231
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,610
I studied as hard as I could and became an archaeologist!

232
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,740
I can read the Poneglyph too!

233
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,540
That runt can...!?

234
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
Stop it, Robin!

235
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,040
So let me...

236
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
...stay with you!

237
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,670
Mom!

238
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,630
Robin!

239
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,300
Please...

240
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,760
...don't...

241
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,100
...leave me alone anymore!

242
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,120
What's with that bombarding!?

243
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,870
Commencing the Buster Call.

244
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,000
All ships, start the attack.

245
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,340
Target everything on the island of archaeology, Ohara.

246
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,470
The research done by Ohara's scholars has exceeded our expectations.

247
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,760
That knowledge could be passed on.

248
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,010
We must not let the exposure be anywhere but on this island.

249
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,350
Completely obliterate the demons living on Ohara.

250
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,390
In the name of Justice!

251
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,020
Shit! What the hell!?

252
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,240
We still haven't left the island!

253
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,650
Do they want to kill us?

254
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,030
The Tree of Omniscience took a direct hit!

255
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,830
This must be the power of the Headquarters.

256
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,250
The government was planning to end it like this from the start, the fools.

257
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,080
Chief, that kid says she's an archaeologist.

258
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,590
Yeah, she indeed said that.

259
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,420
Though I don't know if it's true or not.

260
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,590
When we don't know, the safer solution is to erase the problem...

261
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,340
Remember her face well.

262
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,010
Be sure not to let her get off the island.

263
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,430
We're retreating!

264
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,850
Then, Olvia...

265
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,680
Enough!

266
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,850
It ain't the time for this, forget her!

267
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,230
If we stay here, we'll get blown up too!

268
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,230
Our first priority is my life!

269
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,730
All hands, retreat!

270
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,240
Return to the ship!

271
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,750
Do something about the library's fire!

272
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,460
Protect the Tree of Omniscience!

273
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,270
I've wanted to do this...

274
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,360
...for a long time.

275
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,070
Robin!

276
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,580
Mom!

277
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,500
It's my fault.

278
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,830
Robin...

279
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,790
Is it true that you can read the Poneglyphes?

280
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,550
If I had paid closer attention...

281
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,380
I'm sorry, I wanted to read them no matter what...

282
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,010
I'm really surprised that you managed...

283
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,520
...to accomplish something as great as this.

284
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,020
You did your best and studied a lot.

285
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,940
This isn't something anyone can do.

286
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,900
You're amazing, Robin!

287
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,830
Fortunately, the only ones who know about this
 are the officials who were here earlier.

288
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,410
We can't afford to lose any time here.

289
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,120
Olvia, take Robin and run away!

290
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,500
If you can manage to sneak on the evacuation ship
 with Robin, you two can escape from the island!

291
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,300
Robin!

292
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,800
So you were here? I've been searchin' for ya!

293
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,590
Saulo!

294
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,890
Ya met with Olvia too.

295
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,930
Saulo!

296
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,850
Why are you on this island?

297
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,560
This must be some kind of fate.

298
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,600
My ship sunk and I was saved on the beach by Robin.

299
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,230
More importantly, this situation is really bad!

300
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,940
Ya gotta leave the island quickly!

301
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,990
Take care of Robin.

302
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,200
Help my daughter escape from the island at all costs!

303
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,740
No! What about you, mom?

304
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,410
Won't you stay with me?

305
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,990
Olvia, you are...

306
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,830
I still have something to do here.

307
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Mom! I don't wanna be separated from you!

308
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
I just met you!

309
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,630
I'll stay here too!

310
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,460
Robin.

311
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,840
As a scholar of Ohara, you should know all of this too well.

312
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,970
History is the people's treasure.

313
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,430
It'll certainly illuminate the future you're about to live.

314
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,220
However, you must teach the next generation...

315
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,600
...the history you've inherited from the past, otherwise it'll disappear.

316
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,850
Put out the fire!

317
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,850
Protect the books!

318
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,070
Ohara didn't wish to reveal the history,

319
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,400
we only wanted to hear the voices of the past and protect them!

320
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,120
Our research ends here.

321
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,450
But even if Ohara is crushed,

322
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,500
we can't give up on the future you'll be living in!

323
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,710
I don't get it!

324
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,170
You'll understand someday.

325
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,010
Go now, Saulo!

326
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,310
Is this alright?

327
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,020
Yes.

328
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,730
No! I want to stay here too!

329
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:58,770
Mom!

330
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,190
Mom!!

331
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,110
I'm glad I was able to hear you call me by that name...

332
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,280
Thank you...

333
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,910
From now on, you have to take my share and...

334
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,740
LIVE, ROBIN!!

335
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,840
Vice Admiral!

336
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:31,850
Vice Admiral Kuzan!

337
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,890
What!?

338
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:33,970
On the island...

339
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,720
Yes, that's without a doubt...

340
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,770
So what is it!?

341
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,520
Get to the point!

342
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,400
That's the deserter,

343
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,110
Vice Admiral Saulo!!

344
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,860
Saulo! Go back, please!

345
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,030
Impossible, I can't do that!

346
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,200
Robin!

347
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,490
Be proud, Robin!

348
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,820
Yer mom is great!

349
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,450
Ohara is great!

350
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,210
Someday, ya'll have to pass on this island's history, Robin!

351
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,710
Ohara fought against the world!

352
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,000
Stop this!

353
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,760
Just capturing them is fine!

354
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,340
They're not rowdy pirates!

355
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,510
Are ya such weaklings that ya can't control them!?

356
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,560
We've caught a bunch of ships investigatin' history.

357
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,560
I don't get why they absolutely must die!

358
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,230
Vice Admiral Saulo!

359
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,060
We found a survivor!

360
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,820
How could you slay my nakama!?

361
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,110
Do ya really want the weapon?

362
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
You pitiful people...

363
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,950
You've been attacking us restlessly without any reason!

364
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,200
Hey, he's a Vice Admiral!

365
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,540
Never questioning the laws,

366
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,750
pretending you only want to stop the weapon's revival!

367
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,380
Aren't you just scared of the past you know nothing about!?

368
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,590
This is a top-secret mission.

369
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,710
The Buster Call?

370
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,600
Become one of the five Vice Admirals who'll command one of this great offensive's ten warships.

371
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,220
They are scholars!

372
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,930
Why do we have to go this far?

373
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,940
Of all the scholars we've captured thus far, my eyes only see people truly wanting to know the history!

374
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,190
If the research they're working on is dangerous, the government just has to help them!

375
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,280
We're the ones who're unnecessarily taking other people's lives away!

376
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,410
Give me some kind of proof that they're criminals.

377
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,200
Are you doubting the government?

378
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,740
Shut up and obey.

379
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,290
Let me hear your story...

380
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,250
...for just a little bit.

381
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,380
This is an emergency!

382
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,460
Vice Admiral Saulo took a criminal with him and fled!

383
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,930
He knows everything about our next mission.

384
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:36,760
Pursue them.

385
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,350
Catch Saulo and Olvia at all costs.

386
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,810
I don't care if you open fire on them.

387
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,690
I'll take care of the pursuers once they reach us.

388
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,110
Saulo, you won't ever be able to come back to the Marines.

389
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,230
It's alright.

390
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,940
I can't stay a Marine if I got this doubtful feeling inside.

391
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,370
They may be protecting the laws, but the mission this time is way too harsh.

392
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,620
I only abided by my own justice.

393
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,370
Alright, quickly go warn your homeland.

394
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,790
I won't thank you.

395
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,370
I'll pray for your good luck.

396
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,090
FIRE!

397
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,340
They came targeting me!

398
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,270
Saulo!!

399
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,100
Oh, it hit!

400
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,190
We're sorry!

401
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,350
Don't apologize!

402
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,560
He's an accomplice to the demons now!

403
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm sorry, Robin...

404
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,440
That must've startled you...

405
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,320
Wait here for a sec.

406
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,490
Firing from the shore...

407
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,450
What would they have done if they hurt Robin!?

408
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Vice Admiral, please stop this!

409
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,330
What are you planning to do!?

410
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,920
I've got no idea of what is right,

411
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,540
so I'll just protect my friend!

412
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,880
Stop it! Saulo!

413
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,800
Get ready!

414
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,760
You won't get off easily, having made me your enemy!

415
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,980
There's Still More!

416
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,080
Stop it! Saulo!

417
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,210
Get ready!

418
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,790
You won't get off easily, having made me your enemy!

419
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,310
What's happening!?

420
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,020
It's Vice Admiral Saulo!

421
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,860
Vice Admiral Saulo who escaped with Nico Olvia is attacking us!

422
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,730
Why is he here?

423
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,030
I don't know!

424
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,320
This island is done for!

425
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,950
Everything will be reduced to ashes!

426
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,330
Don't give up!

427
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,750
Don't leave any book behind!

428
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,750
We have to pass down the history!

429
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,500
Throw them in the lake from the window!

430
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,590
It's better than to have them burnt!

431
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,340
Hurry!

432
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,670
Now!

433
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,510
Saulo, stop it!

434
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,680
You'll die!

435
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,100
Throw the books outside the library!

436
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,390
Don't let any book,

437
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,980
don't even let a sentence, be lost!

438
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,980
So that the words of our ancestors from the last few thousand years...

439
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,860
...can reach the future!

440
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,280
Robin!

441
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,660
What are you doing?

442
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,160
Run to the evacuation ship while you still can!

443
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,830
You won't survive long if you stay on this island!

444
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,030
Mom!

445
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,170
This is a Present Announcement!

446
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,060
One Piece Theater! Various times!

447
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:57,870
We'll offer seven different sets of these to five of you as presents!

448
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,750
Write your address, complete name, age, phone
 number and opinion of the show,

449
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,000
and quickly send your completed form after the show!

450
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,780
We'll be waiting!

451
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,510
Shoot Saulo!

452
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,180
Robin! Run away quickly!

453
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,010
What was your mother's wish!?

454
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,720
LIVE, ROBIN!!

455
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,770
The evacuation ship is leaving!

456
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,190
Wait, someone is coming!

457
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,940
Isn't she...!?

458
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,110
Ain't that the monster?

459
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,240
It's true!

460
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,110
Go away, monster!

461
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,820
Hey, don't be stupid!

462
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
No... Wait...

463
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,160
That girl... Isn't she Olvia's, the woman who was in the newspaper...

464
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,210
Isn't that brat the criminal's daughter!?

465
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,710
That's right! If we let her aboard the ship, we could be targeted too!

466
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,460
Don't be foolish!

467
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,710
She's just a kid, hurry and pull her in!

468
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,420
Evacuation ship, don't let that runt get aboard!

469
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,550
Even if she's a kid, she's an archaeologist!

470
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,930
She's one of this offensive's targets!

471
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,350
Chief Spandine!

472
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,180
Is that true?

473
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,100
Look! With this, we are in danger too!

474
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,480
Robin!

475
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,860
The CP9, huh?

476
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,940
How foolish...

477
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,400
Chief! Vice Admiral Saulo is heading towards us!

478
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,570
For real!?

479
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,320
We didn't even have to make him spit out Olvia's whereabouts!

480
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,410
Fire, fire!

481
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,450
Attack him!

482
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,750
Saulo!

483
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,510
Kuzan-san!

484
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,600
Kuzan...

485
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
My, my, my...

486
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,480
If the Buster Call was somehow hindered by a former Marine,

487
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,020
wouldn't we look quite ridiculous?

488
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,650
Kuzan...

489
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,780
Do you hold pride in this bombardment?

490
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,490
Get back to ya senses!

491
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,120
This is weird!

492
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,370
You should have realized it too, that all of this is nothing but an example!

493
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,450
Just for that, they're going to annihilate Ohara!

494
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,750
If this is for the betterment of the world, it can't be helped.

495
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,170
Aren't the scholars breaking the law?

496
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,970
What's called 'justice' changes shape depending on where you stand.

497
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,880
That's why I won't blame your justice.

498
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,600
However, if you're going to get in our way...

499
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,520
I won't just ignore it.

500
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,940
The evacuation ship was blown up!

501
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,610
W-Why?

502
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,740
It was a bombardment!

503
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,030
From a Marine ship...

504
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,120
It's from Vice Admiral Sakazuki's ship!

505
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,580
That fool...

506
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,330
If we're doing this, better do it thoroughly.

507
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,540
If by any chance, even a single scholar was hiding on that ship,

508
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,250
every single sacrifice made today would have been wasted.

509
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,670
Evil must be completely eradicated!

510
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,430
Is this justice's way of doing things!?

511
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,180
Can you still hold pride in it after this!?

512
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,850
I didn't plan to overdo it like that total idiot!

513
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,850
Get away, Robin!

514
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,440
His strength is abnormal!

515
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,270
Saulo just fled!

516
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,070
He's carrying a scholar!

517
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,370
Saulo, are you alright!?

518
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,960
Robin, run away.

519
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,010
Run as fast as you can!

520
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,470
If you stay on the island, your life is gone for sure!

521
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,720
Set out on the sea with my raft!

522
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,890
What about you?

523
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,260
This is the end for me...

524
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,600
I've been caught!

525
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,480
Go!

526
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,350
No! There's nobody at sea!

527
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,980
Listen well, Robin!

528
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,270
You might be alone at the moment,

529
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
but someday,

530
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,570
you'll definitely find nakama!

531
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,070
Nakama?

532
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,370
Yeah...

533
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,200
The sea is vast.

534
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,660
Someday, without any doubt,

535
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,040
nakama who will protect you will appear!

536
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,090
No one is born in this world being completely alone!

537
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,880
Run, Robin!

538
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,430
Without looking behind you!

539
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,760
When things are rough, do as I taught you!

540
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,930
Laugh like this!

541
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,180
Saulo, look out!

542
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,400
Saulo!

543
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,820
Go meet the nakama that are certainly waiting for you...

544
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,910
...somewhere on the sea!

545
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,870
Robin!

546
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,080
Live with them...

547
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,140
This is the end!

548
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,430
Is this the history chosen by mankind?

549
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,190
What fragile things humans are...

550
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,480
I'm sorry, Robin...

551
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,200
I couldn't even leave you...

552
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,870
...with words said as a mother.

553
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
The Tree of Omniscience...

554
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,540
It's falling!

555
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,460
Absolute Justice.

556
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,010
It's been known to sometimes drive a person into madness.

557
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,930
I've decided to let you escape from this island.

558
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,260
A seed that was protected by Saulo...

559
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,890
I wonder what it'll grow into.

560
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,350
It's your choice to hate whoever you want,

561
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,560
but consider yourself lucky to still have your life.

562
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,480
Try to live as plainly as you can...

563
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,940
I left a line of ice on the sea.

564
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,030
Travel straight ahead with this small boat,

565
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
and you'll reach land.

566
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,620
And then... Always remember.

567
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,410
I am not your ally.

568
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,670
If you do something,

569
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,960
I'll be the first enemy to come capture you.

570
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,380
My mom is on the island!

571
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,130
No one will be saved.

572
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,130
If it's so painful that you want to die,

573
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,470
you're free to do so.

574
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,100
This is the greatest library in the world.

575
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,770
Do you like books?

576
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,190
Today is Robin's birthday!

577
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,020
Congratulations, Robin!

578
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,860
Be proud, Robin!

579
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,780
Ohara is great!

580
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,400
We cannot give up...

581
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,240
...on the future you'll be living in!

582
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,530
Just laugh.

583
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,830
When you have a hard time, just laugh.

584
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,830
If I laugh while I'm in pain, I'll look like an idiot.

585
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,540
That's not true!

586
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,930
Go meet the nakama that are certainly waiting
 for you somewhere on the sea!

587
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,770
Robin!

588
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,040
Survivors?

589
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,880
There can't possibly be any.

590
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:42,460
Hey!

591
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,170
Look at this lake.

592
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,090
T-This is...!

593
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,270
There are enough books to fill the lake!

594
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,150
Is this a coincidence!?

595
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,520
Oh, it's her!

596
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,480
It's definitely her!

597
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,110
Where was she?

598
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,860
Did you capture her?

599
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,440
No!

600
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,660
Searching for a suspicious young girl as our only clue,

601
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,870
we spotted her on a passenger ship,

602
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,830
leaving from an island located far North-East of Ohara.

603
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,080
However, we lost sight of her right after that...

604
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,870
She's got the devil's luck...

605
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,880
Back then, I saw that brat...

606
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,720
She was escaping from the flame that engulfed Ohara, on a boat!

607
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,180
But when I tried to chase after her...

608
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,510
The helm suddenly wouldn't move, as if it was imprisoned in ice.

609
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,020
There's no doubt Saulo must have let her escape before dying!

610
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,100
Even though she's young, her existence is dangerous.

611
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,020
Especially since she can decipher the Poneglyph.

612
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,440
Don't hesitate about what method to use!

613
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,440
If you don't capture her in a very short amount of time,

614
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,030
all our efforts will be proven worthless.

615
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,790
$79,000,000!?

616
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,160
An eight year old girl has such a large bounty?

617
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,750
It seems she's a survivor of the famous Ohara criminals, who were scheming to destroy the world.

618
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,960
That Ohara!?

619
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,630
I don't know how she did it, but I heard she sank six Marine battleships.

620
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,430
That's why they put such a high bounty...

621
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,100
I heard the government and the Marine Headquarters are working directly on this!

622
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,480
The ideas of the executed scholars were passed onto her.

623
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,230
We can't have her run in the wild.

624
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,230
That brat can't be allowed to live, she's the child of the devil!

625
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,610
I'm always grateful to you for helping out.

626
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,530
No, thanks for letting me work.

627
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,580
By the way, today before dinner we'll be receiving some guests for you.

628
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:40,920
Don't let her escape!

629
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,380
Alright, give me my money!

630
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,000
I told you where she was, right!?

631
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,130
She works a lot even though she's small.

632
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,180
What is it?

633
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,510
You're still awake?

634
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,850
You'll have to get up early to run errands tomorrow.

635
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,140
Sleep quickly.

636
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:56,850
Yes.

637
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,930
She's a good girl...

638
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,140
But if she stays with us, we'll be in danger too!

639
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,980
Plus... Look at this bounty!

640
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
Dear! She's not in her room!

641
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,490
Shit! That runt heard what we said!

642
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm sorry.

643
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,830
I don't have any food.

644
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,460
I know about you, Nico Robin!

645
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,670
I'm a wanted man too.

646
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,590
I'll feed you if you do some little jobs for me.

647
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,390
Captain!

648
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,470
It's the Marine Headquarters!

649
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,890
Where's Robin!?

650
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,350
Let's hand her over!

651
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,390
Shit!

652
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,440
That pest is cursed!

653
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,780
Your sin is being alive!

654
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,450
What? Nico Robin is in this town!?

655
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,490
Find her!

656
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,160
Hand her over to the government!

657
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,960
I found it...

658
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,210
It's a Poneglyph.

659
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
Don't come in!

660
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,880
I've got nothing to sell you!

661
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,170
I'm sixteen.

662
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,090
I'll do anything.

663
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,380
Let me enter this organization.

664
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,090
You betrayed me!

665
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,550
Robin!

666
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,890
Nico Robin, I want to borrow your power.

667
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,100
It seems you can read the Poneglyph, am I right?

668
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,480
Right now, in this very place...

669
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,990
If you trigger the Buster Call,

670
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,030
Enies Lobby will be exterminated...

671
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,660
...and so will all of you.

672
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620
Wh-What kind of crap are you saying!?

673
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,380
As if we could be hurt by an ally attack!

674
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,250
What are you babbling about, you bitch!?

675
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,920
Twenty years ago...

676
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,380
It stole everything away from me,

677
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,590
while crushing a lot of people's lives.

678
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,140
With a single strike...

679
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,810
The Buster Call.

680
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,060
This attack has...

681
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,850
...finally shown up.

682
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,100
It's aimed at the nakama I love.

683
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,980
The more I wish to be at your sides,

684
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,320
the more my fate bares its fangs to you!

685
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,780
No matter how far I continue my journey on the sea,

686
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,280
there's still that gigantic enemy I can't shake off!

687
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,540
Because my enemy is...

688
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,330
...the world and its darkness!

689
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,920
With Ao Kiji and this time too,

690
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
I've involved you in this twice!

691
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:38,630
If this continues forever, no matter how kind you all are...

692
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,760
Someday you'll see me as a burden!

693
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,230
It's obvious that someday you'll betray me and throw me away!

694
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,190
That's what scares me the most!

695
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,270
That's why I didn't want you to come save me!

696
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,520
If it's a life I'll lose someday,

697
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,320
I want to die here and now!

698
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,780
Robin...

699
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,370
Robin-chan...

700
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,830
Robin...

701
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,000
So that's what it was.

702
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,590
I understand now!

703
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,250
That's right on the mark!

704
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,880
That's exactly it!

705
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,970
There's no one out there who would be stupid enough to not think you're a burden after traveling with you!

706
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,350
Look at this flag, pirate scum!

707
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,640
That mark!

708
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,350
It represents the unity of over 170 countries,

709
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,190
dotting the four seas and the Grand Line!

710
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,990
This is the world!

711
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,320
Do you even get how insignificant your existences are compared to this?

712
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,870
Do you get how powerful the organization after this woman is!?

713
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,670
I understand Robin's enemy very well...

714
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,590
Sogeking.

715
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,840
Make that flag...

716
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,800
...burst into flames.

717
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,180
Roger that.

718
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,390
My new weapon,

719
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,520
the Great Pachinko.

720
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,810
Going by the name of Kabuto!

721
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,940
Closely behold its immense power!

722
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,870
No way...

723
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,210
Done.

724
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,380
They... They did it!

725
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,260
Do these guys get the meaning of shooting a flag?

726
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,090
The pirates just...

727
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,640
They declared war on the World Government!

728
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,180
Are you out of your mind!?

729
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,770
Don't think you'll be able to survive having the world as your enemy!

730
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,400
YOU WANNA BET!?

731
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,660
Robin!

732
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,000
I still haven't heard it from your mouth!

733
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,550
SAY YOU WANT TO LIVE!!

734
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,430
Robin.

735
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,220
Robin!

736
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,690
Live...

737
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,820
You can't be allowed to live in this world, Robin.

738
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,150
Your existence itself is an unforgivable sin!

739
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:43,940
Robin!!

740
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,780
I thought wishing for it was forbidden...

741
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,460
Nobody would allow me that...

742
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,330
I WANT TO DIE!!

743
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,840
The sea is vast.

744
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,750
Someday, without any doubt,

745
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,920
nakama who will protect you will appear!

746
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,850
Believe in Luffy.

747
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,520
If...

748
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,520
If I'm allowed to declare my wish...

749
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,990
Then I...

750
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,490
I WANT TO LIVE!!

751
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,790
TAKE ME OUT TO THE SEA WITH YOU!!

752
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,810
I love you guys!

753
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,020
Damn it!

754
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,820
Let's go!

1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,620
GOMU GOMU NO PISTOL!

21
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,100
Impaled...

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,390
Buried alive...

23
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,110
Dried out...

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,430
You may have been able to come back from all that...

25
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,340
But you won't stand again after this one.

26
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,830
The fight is over.

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,480
The poison is already spreading through your body.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,680
You don't understand anything.

29
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,690
Hurry! Hurry!!

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,990
What's going on?

31
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,840
The Marines helped us find you!

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,490
Did you find the bombers?

33
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,330
We haven't seen them, but I know where they are!

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,640
We've been looking at it the whole time,

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,740
but it was obscured from us!

36
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,720
The bombers must be in there!

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,670
Nami-swan~! Vivi-chuwan~! 

38
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,490
WHY ARE YOU UP THERE!?

39
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,140
Yo! I've been looking for you guys!

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,990
ZORO! YOU'RE HERE TOO!?

41
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,890
What are you guys doing all the way over there?

42
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,410
Gero, gero, gero, gero, gero!

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:24,280
Great wings!
My name is guardian deity Pell of a country.

44
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,510
Baroque Work?

45
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,610
Never heard of them.

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,240
Where's your proof that such an organization even exists?

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,680
We are but humble citizens, Mr. Marine.

48
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,080
Would you harm us poor citizens in the confusion of the rebellion?

49
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,770
Sergeant Major Tashigi!

50
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,140
Why are you hesitating!?

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,750
If you just stand there waiting for proof, you can't prevent anything!

52
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,390
Identify your enemy with your own eyes!

53
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,690
Aye!

54
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,010
I apologize!

55
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,830
4:30...

56
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,820
We're almost out of time...

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,910
The clock?

58
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,400
Gero, gero, gero, gero!

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,510
Hey, listen to this, Mr. 7!

60
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,280
I think this is a pretty important job!

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,910
You would be exactly right to say that, Miss Fathersday!

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,050
And I think we just might get a HUGE position after this job!

63
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,650
Gero, gero!

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,620
That's about the size of it!

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,460
Isn't it great, isn't it great, Miss Fathersday?

66
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,530
I mean, all we're meant to do is take this huge cannon,

67
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,650
Aim it at the crowd, and then LAAAUUUNCH it~!

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,150
And that's the size of the plan!

69
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,750
Isn't it great?

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,280
Gero! It's time, Mr. 7!

71
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,670
Ready to ignite~!

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,550
I...

73
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,900
...don't understand what exactly?

74
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,520
GOMU GOMU NO GATLING GUN!

75
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,290
Don't you understand?

76
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,720
You're already dead!

77
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,020
The poison entered your wounds and is about to finish you off!

78
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,330
Your body's starting to go numb, isn't it?

79
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,470
No matter whether you win or lose this fight...

80
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,530
You're going to be buried within this underground sanctuary!

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,300
T-minus 15 secounds to launch!

82
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,230
Our target... the center of the Square!

83
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,140
Gero, gero!

84
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,500
IG-NITE~!

85
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,010
Oi, Nami!

86
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,700
What the hell are you planning!?

87
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,130
We don't have time for stunts like this!

88
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,110
If we screw up, we're dead!

89
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,080
OI!

90
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,850
I know that!

91
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,160
Just stay still!

92
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,420
I'm making some calculations!

93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,420
Stay still!? I don't even know why we're standing like this!

94
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,460
What the hell are you going to do!?

95
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,570
You'll see when I do it!

96
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,060
Here we go!

97
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,290
Gero, gero, gero, gero!

98
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,500
Hey, listen to this, Mr. 7!

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,940
I think we should do a countdown for a special occasion like this!

100
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,550
I'd size that up as a plan!

101
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,760
It's great! It's great! It's fun!

102
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,020
Warning for...

103
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,950
Typhoon!

104
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,820
T-MINUS 13 SECONDS!

105
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,910
CYCLONE TENPO!

106
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,850
Oi!

107
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,630
Cyclone Tenpo is just a boomerang game for parties!

108
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm aiming for the clock tower!

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,990
What?

110
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,540
They're flying up.

111
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,250
Chopper!

112
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,660
Jump up to Sanji-kun!

113
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,610
WHAT!?

114
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,050
Does that mean... the plan...

115
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,920
...is to keep flying the whole way up!?

116
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,530
Sanji-kun!

117
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,850
You know what to do, right!?

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,140
There's not much time!

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,360
I think I get the idea.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,110
Yosh! Nothing to do but give it a shot!

121
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,200
We don't have time to think about this!

122
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,750
Please, Tony-kun!

123
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,410
Yosh!

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,120
Hold on tight, Vivi!

125
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,180
I get it.

126
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,510
So that's the plan.

127
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,420
Chopper!

128
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,660
Jump onto my right leg!

129
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,370
Right!

130
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,010
12...

131
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,590
HERE THEY COME, ZORO!

132
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,300
Alright! Perfect!

133
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,900
I just need to get them up to the top, right?

134
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,590
10...

135
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,100
ZORO!

136
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,630
Yosh, leave it to me!

137
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,750
KATANA!?

138
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,010
Idiot, don't be scared!

139
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,040
I'm using the back of the blades!

140
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,320
Now get a good footing!

141
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,900
Right.

142
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,510
9...

143
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,530
Be carefull, Vivi!

144
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,710
There's some real wairdos up there!

145
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,270
Yes, I know them!

146
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,580
No...

147
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Miss Wednesday!

148
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,510
Gero, gero, gero! I remember her!

149
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,240
She betrayed the organization!

150
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,310
They saw them!

151
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,690
WHAT!?

152
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,780
Hold on!

153
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,360
We're in mid-air!

154
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,330
If they shoot at us...!

155
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,610
Your desire does not lie within this country!

156
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,880
Am I wrong?

157
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,650
You're fighting for someone else's desire!

158
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,590
Why would you die for that!?

159
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,050
Just one or two nakama...

160
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,520
If you abandoned them, they would never hold you back!

161
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,440
You're all such utter fools...

162
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,280
Like I said...

163
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,250
You don't understand anything.

164
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,440
Vivi...

165
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,870
She tells others not to die...

166
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,640
But she's the first one who throws her life away to save someone else.

167
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,140
If I abandones her, she'd die!

168
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,070
You'd kill her!

169
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't understand you!

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,790
That's why I'm saying you should just abandon such an annoying-

171
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,530
I DON'T WANT HER TO DIE!

172
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,160
WE'RE NAKAMA!

173
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,280
That's why, as long as she doesn't give up on her country...

174
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,310
We won't stop fighting!

175
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,270
Even if you die?

176
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,140
When I die...

177
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,430
That'll be that.

178
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,000
ADJUST! GERO GERO GUN!

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,650
Well this is an unexpected bonus!

180
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,300
ASJUST! YELLOW GUN!

181
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,410
It's great! It's great! They're as good as dead!

182
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,710
Bastarts! Pointing your guns at Vivi-cha-

183
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,200
We have to do something!

184
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,810
They're a sniper pair!

185
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,630
Chopper!

186
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm gonna launch you up there!

187
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,980
Do what you can after that!

188
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,290
Me!?

189
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,750
Seven seconds left!

190
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,240
Do something, dammit!

191
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:33,960
Ready!?

192
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,920
Let's do this, Chopper, Vivi!

193
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,360
Right!

194
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,320
Right!

195
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,740
LADY SMASH!

196
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,450
Hey, listen to this!

197
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,600
Our guns...

198
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,360
...are sized to explode when they collide!

199
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,750
Zoro!

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,400
That idiot!

201
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,710
He took a direct...!

202
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,960
Here we go, Vivi!

203
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,220
Give it all you've got, Tony-kun!

204
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,040
Gero, gero! Running away...

205
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,090
...is futile!

206
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,330
SMASH!

207
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:15,910
Who...?

208
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,990
Miss Wednesday is...

209
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,850
...sized where!?

210
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,320
PEACOCK STRING

211
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,440
She's above us?

212
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,480
GOOO!!

213
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,240
Your most valiant attempts at yelling...

214
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,190
...won't make your body listen.

215
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,010
A fine state you're in, Straw Hat.

216
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,260
STASBER

217
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,200
Gero, gero!

218
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,250
Too bad...

219
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,630
You missed!

220
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,950
RUNBACK!

221
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,600
YES!

222
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,490
VIVI!

223
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,400
HEY!

224
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,740
You over there!

225
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,040
You snuck in through that secret passage again, didn't you!?

226
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,160
Wah! A guard!

227
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:09,920
Run!

228
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,940
Chaka-sama, Pell-sama!

229
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,800
Please say something to those children!

230
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,330
Of course...

231
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,600
Vivi-sama, are you going out?

232
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,320
Yup, the secret base!

233
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,890
Alright, have fun.

234
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,980
Where did Vivi-sama go?

235
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,650
Sorry...

236
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,040
It's a secret.

237
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,240
To the clock tower, eh?

238
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,080
Did she stop it?

239
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,250
What?

240
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,640
You're still alive?

241
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,130
T-The explosion...?

242
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,130
What fell on me just now?

243
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,270
What happened?

244
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,860
Something funny's going on up there.

245
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,110
Vivi... hasn't come out...

246
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,580
HELP! EVERYONE!

247
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,390
Vivi!

248
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,020
The bomb has a timer!

249
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,910
IT'S STILL GOING TO EXPLODE!

250
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,020
WHAAAT!?

251
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
How evil...!

252
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,420
At least call it "being prepared", Mr. Cobra.

253
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,690
When executing an operation, one must always account for any accidents that may happen.

254
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,650
In case something should happen to the bombers before the appointed time,

255
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,900
I made sure the bomb would detonate automatically.

256
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh well, it will only make a few seconds difference.

257
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,330
Ideally, it would have detonated in the center of the Square.

258
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,520
But, given its proximity and massive size, it won't matter.

259
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,280
"If I do this, I can stop the rebellion."

260
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,710
"If I do that, I can stop the rebellion."

261
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,280
Your zealous idealism disgusts me.

262
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,930
I will tell you again:

263
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,680
You cannot save this country.

264
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,980
Shit! This can't be happening!

265
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,710
Even though we stopped the firing, the bomb...

266
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,770
...has a timer!

267
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,090
The blast's gonna be five kilometers wide...

268
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,430
The Square and the city are going to be completely destroyed!

269
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,960
WHAT'S GOING ON!?

270
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,430
You mean stopping the Square bombing...

271
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,970
...was impossible from the very beginning!?

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,850
You made us search for the cannon...!

273
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,700
You even told us when they were going to fire it...!

274
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,560
Just...

275
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,550
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE TO HUMILIATE ME BEFORE YOU'RE SATISFIED!?

276
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,410
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE TO SNEER AT ME UNTIL YOU'RE HAPPY!?

277
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,280
CROCODILE!

278
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,350
CROCODILE!

279
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,940
Was that...

280
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,700
The bird guy...

281
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,060
Pell!

282
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
This place brings back memories, doesn't it?

283
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,870
The Suna Suna Clan's secret base.

284
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,780
Honestly...

285
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,550
You caused me no small amount of headaches...

286
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,550
...with your unpredictable actions.

287
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,960
Pell, listen!

288
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,710
The bomb has a timer, and it's going to explode any second!

289
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,980
Vivi-sama!

290
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,350
What were you doing in the ammunition storeroom!?

291
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,120
Oi, what happened!?

292
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,630
What was that explosion about!?

293
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,490
Do we not repeatedly tell you to stay away from the ammunitions store!?

294
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,960
Pell!

295
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,280
Pell-sama!

296
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,110
I messed up trying to make some fireworks.

297
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,980
Remember, this is the anniversary of your joining the Royal Guard, right?

298
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,310
Hey! What are you-!?

299
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,210
How many times do I have to tell you not to come here!?

300
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,210
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN!?

301
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,810
Infidel!

302
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,450
Do you have any idea what you've just done!?

303
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,580
You're fired! Fired, damn it! Doing such a thing to the Princess...!

304
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,890
Wait, Igaram!

305
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,210
Oi, oi...

306
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,250
If you had been badly hurt...

307
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,840
What would I have done?

308
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,860
More Higher! I said higer!

309
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,580
V-Vivi-sama!

310
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,540
You must keep this a secret from His Majesty, okay?

311
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,830
His Majesty has specifically told me not to fly with you on my back!

312
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,310
You don't have to if you don't want to!

313
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,400
But otherwise, I'll never forgive you for today.

314
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,190
And you were the one who said you'd do whatever I wanted, Pell.

315
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,880
Hey, Pell.

316
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,280
Yes?

317
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,310
Why do you spend every day training?

318
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,540
Because I am a guard.

319
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,430
It is my duty to protect this country.

320
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,740
I must be strong.

321
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,070
Who are you going to fight?

322
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,950
I don't know.

323
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,360
It's more about protecting than fighting.

324
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,070
Are they different?

325
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,580
The goals are different.

326
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,690
Oh...

327
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,270
That's weird.

328
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,050
I...

329
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,530
Devoting my life to the service of the Nefertari Family...

330
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,930
...fills my heart with such everlasting pride.

331
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,040
I am a Guardian Spirit of Arabasta!

332
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,260
The Falcon!

333
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,840
One who destroys the enemies of the Royal Family!

334
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

335
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

336
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

337
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,290
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

338
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,210
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

339
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,470
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

340
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,890
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

341
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,150
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

342
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,360
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

343
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

344
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,080
Let's paint a story of the future

345
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,330
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

346
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

347
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

348
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,550
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

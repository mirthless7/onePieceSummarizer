1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,080
You gave up your companions of East Blue for your boat!

2
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,799
Why do you cry?

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,779
Baka!

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,649
One does not cry! Baka!

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,589
It is right which…

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,009
You split me the heart to be wanted to protect your all alone boat.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,729
We do not cry!

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,699
None us cries!

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,760
What do they have?

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,259
At all events, you include/understand or not?

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
We are not any more companions!

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,600
Then…

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,570
Such an amount of cruelty. I will sing this ballade:

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,490
Broken Friendship. Rupture of the Wind of North.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,839
Yay, Aniki!

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,170
You foutez yourselves of my mouth?!

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,270
Aniki!

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,220
Help us…

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,710
I will pass the hello to your Aniki.

20
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,180
We know where it is.

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,730
Allons-y.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,409
Onii-san, the tea is ready.

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,160
Made a pause.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,009
Ah, sorry for the disturbance.

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,330
I would take some after having finished that.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,800
Ca hurts!

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,470
Ohhh, have!

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,330
Then, Onii-chan.

29
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,550
Answer my question…

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,420
What will you make after having repaired the boat?

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,480
What?

32
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,829
One of course will set out again with the adventure

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,100
and perhaps to turn over in my village of East Blue.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,599
It will not be a voyage around the world…

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,949
But for a boat which surmounted Grand Line,

36
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,920
the return will be triumphing.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,509
The hand on the heart, I go…

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,980
Not, you cannot turn over on East Blue.

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,710
It is too much far.

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,480
Aniki.

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,900
I threw an eye on the boat when we brought back it.

42
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,280
He, stop you!

43
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,739
What you will make in Merry?!

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,959
Remove these cords! Put back the boat!

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,739
If you damage Merry, my 8000 men will not tolerate.

46
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,089
You listen to me, dumbs of désosseurs?!

47
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,689
You go morfler if you do not listen to me.

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,789
I am the Master of East Blue, the children are afraid…

49
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,500
By hearing my name, Captain Usopp!

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,980
You do too much noise.

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,569
Do not grip me, you…

52
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,020
The farm.

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,420
Ca hurts!

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,789
Afflicted, I excuse myself…

55
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,140
Forgive me…

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,860
Your boat is foutu.

57
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,420
The estimates of Galley were true for it.

58
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,670
As a desossor, I advise you to dismount it.

59
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,899
Get stuffed!

60
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,049
I will help you in the stages of disassembling.

61
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,330
What you tell?!

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,100
Wait, until you will make?

63
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,059
Stop!

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,340
Aniki!

65
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,249
I say to you just that I want to help you to dismount the boat.

66
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,810
Stop your conneries!

67
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,350
I will not let myself make!

68
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,189
Merry is MY boat!

69
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,770
Not, it is not…

70
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,770
Nothing more than one boat.

71
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,880
What?!

72
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,570
I presently asked you what you would do after having repaired the boat.

73
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,850
If you did not hope to risk your life on sea with this boat…

74
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,110
I would not have put the question.

75
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,110
But….

76
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,690
Since you say to want to turn over on East Blue with this boat…

77
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,659
I must stop you…

78
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,990
Onii-chan.

79
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,010
This boat will not even be able…

80
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,290
To reach the next shore.

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
Listen,

82
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,780
a boat…

83
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,690
Is born with the promise from…

84
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,000
“To sail from one bank to another.”

85
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,390
What means…

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,100
A boat which cannot reach other bank…

87
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,660
O-oi!

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,130
Stop!

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,150
A boat which cannot sail any more…

90
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,150
IS NOT ANY MORE ONE BOAT!

91
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,570
Aniki!

92
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,500
STOP!

93
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:39,140
The preferred man of the boat!
Tears of Usopp!

94
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,659
Species of dumb!

95
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,180
Do not touch in Merry!

96
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,730
Stupid jerk!

97
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,560
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO INCLUDE/UNDERSTAND…

98
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,820
NOTE YOUR OWN EYES!

99
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
Afflicted, Merry.

100
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,030
I will repair you immediately.

101
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,850
Immediately…

102
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,400
I will continue…

103
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,030
Still…

104
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,190
And still…

105
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,550
I will repair you!

106
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,950
Always!

107
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,440
Oi, drops, Length-Nose!

108
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,180
You saw the hold, not true?

109
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,450
The skittle is broken in the center!

110
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,380
The slats are detached, the frame is foutu too!

111
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,180
With this hull, all will yield to the first wave!

112
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,140
It is not a poor amateur as you who will arrange the things!

113
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,960
FIRM MT MOUTH!

114
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,550
I DO NOT WANT ANY MORE TO HEAR You!

115
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,500
STILL A WORD AND I YOU BOOT THE BOTTOM! DUMB!

116
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,070
Whore!

117
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,000
I knew it already…

118
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,790
Hein?

119
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,710
What you ace known as?

120
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,660
To be…

121
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,960
Honest…

122
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,130
To be honest, I knew all that!

123
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,450
I knew that…

124
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,940
MERRY WAS FOUTU!

125
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,130
I…

126
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,930
Knew.

127
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,790
When I heard the results of the examin…

128
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,650
I understood that what it had occurred this day was quite real.

129
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,170
Initially…

130
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,410
I believed that it was a dream.

131
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,630
I thought that such a stupidity could not take place.

132
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,990
But this night of full moon, in this misty forest…

133
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,260
I heard the hammering of a hammer out of wooden.

134
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,950
Ca came from the boat, and there was supposed over there not to be nobody.

135
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,120
I had noticed…

136
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,330
That the noise came from the boat.

137
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,070
The fog was thick…

138
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,070
But I am sure over there to have seen somebody…

139
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,390
Who hammered with a wood mateau.

140
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,630
And…

141
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,030
Without knowknowing which it was…

142
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,189
Incredible!

143
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,010
The boat had been badly repaired in the morning.

144
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,700
The torn off mast had also returned in its place.

145
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,980
But what I did not include/understand…

146
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,360
Was that which had done that,

147
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,630
knew the original configuration of Merry.

148
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,390
Despite everything the made modifications,

149
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,210
Merry had returned to its initial form.

150
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,220
It was a mystery…

151
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,820
But however, of the words trotaient me in the head.

152
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,500
I do not know if that came from me…

153
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,510
Or if it were him which had spoken.

154
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,580
You do not worry.

155
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,110
I will still hold out.

156
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,880
Ca can appear stupid…

157
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,280
But I think that it was…

158
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,540
Merry…

159
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,240
Its incarnation.

160
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,730
It is what I thought.

161
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,610
It probably knew that the boat had reached its limits…

162
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,070
And had appeared in this form for us to say it.

163
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,520
Here of what I thought by hearing the results of the examin.

164
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,530
You must take to me for insane.

165
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,060
You summers not obliged to believe me.

166
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,350
Aniki?

167
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,560
That I you croive or not…

168
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,070
It resembled a sailor with a wood hammer, hein?

169
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,890
Why…

170
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,700
How do you know it?

171
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,620
You know what, Onii-chan?

172
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,400
You saw Klabautermann.

173
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,750
Klabaru…

174
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,830
Klabautermann.

175
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,580
A legend which is transmitted from generation to generation in the sailors.

176
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,680
A spirit which lies only in the boats which are maintained carefully.

177
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,690
In fact, it is an incarnation of the boat.

178
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,080
It holds a wood hammer in its hand and carries one waxed of sailor.

179
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,369
When the boat is in danger,

180
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,510
it runs around the boat to inform everyone.

181
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,320
It is said that it sometimes saved sailors.

182
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,070
But it is the first time that I intend somebody to affirm to have seen one of them.

183
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,760
More the sailors deal with him,

184
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,980
more the boat is grateful.

185
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,820
This boat was to want to take you along towards the next island no matter what it arrives.

186
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,290
You think that this boat was happy…

187
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,860
To have met a crew which he wanted at all prices to transport…

188
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,400
And to appear under human form?

189
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Merry.

190
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,280
I include/understand.

191
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,570
Then it was you…

192
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:18,340
Who spoke this time to me.

193
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,540
Merry.

194
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,710
But that surprises me.

195
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,360
You fought with your companions in spite of the bad condition of the boat?

196
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,400
It is not so simple only that.

197
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,979
The men do not include/understand anything!

198
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,240
They are stupid!

199
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,520
It would seem that somebody arrives.

200
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,649
If there is somebody outside,

201
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,900
that can be only Zanbai and the others.

202
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,090
Why don't they pass the side sea?

203
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,650
It is true.

204
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,730
Usually, they use the entry top.

205
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,810
Perhaps they bring back Straw hat?

206
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,189
It is true,

207
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,340
I had forgotten that you were used to me as soft food to attract Straw hat!

208
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,250
They will not come. They are not any more my companions.

209
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,770
I said it to you.

210
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,260
Why they do not enter?

211
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,380
Ok, ok, we will open.

212
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,990
Ok, ok, made not such an amount of noise!

213
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,910
Onii-chan, turns over to see your companions.

214
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,500
I cannot.

215
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,839
I defied the captain.

216
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,860
And the problem of the boat is not regulated yet.

217
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,780
What do you understand by “regulated”?

218
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,970
All is regulated if the boat cannot sail any more.

219
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,469
Leave it to me and I will occupy myself some, you will not have with you to make some.

220
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:31,409
As I said, I think that best for you would be to dismount this boat.

221
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,400
Pas la pains to insist! It is my problem!

222
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,429
I want just to help you to regulate your problem, thanks me!

223
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,410
To thank you? You pleasant?

224
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,690
You do not include/understand?

225
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,369
It is also a problem for the boat!

226
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,899
The day when this boat, which will have loved you at the point to appear under human form…

227
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,820
Will run in the middle of the ocean while transporting you…

228
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,339
Oi! It will be able to never rest in peace!

229
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,400
It will never reach beyond.

230
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,880
Then, you would be able to let die a companion?!

231
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,829
Do not say that, that does not have anything to see!

232
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,729
Of course that not! It is similar!

233
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,240
Guy! You do not include/understand anything!

234
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,190
Mozu!

235
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,770
Kiwi!

236
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,400
But which it is?!

237
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,070
Excuse my intrusion.

238
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,440
These two women did not want to let to us enter.

239
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,360
Engineers of Galley it!

240
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,640
What you foutez there?!

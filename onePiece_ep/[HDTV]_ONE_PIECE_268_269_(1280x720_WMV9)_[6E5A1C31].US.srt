1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,040
One Piece Treasure Present! The first keyword is... this!

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,210
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,320
Franky and Robin were taken to the Judiciary Tower.

4
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,600
I couldn't feel better!

5
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,000
Good job on surviving that incident eight years ago,

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,340
Cutty Flam.

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,040
You can't achieve your goals without any sacrifice.

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,140
We are working the best we can to attain peace for all humanity!

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,400
This is pissing me off!

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,290
Tom-san threw his life away just to protect those plans!

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,160
Just because idiots like you exist!

12
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,680
Yoi!

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,200
At the same time, Luffy on Enies Lobby's Main Island was facing ten thousand soldiers.

14
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,900
Chief Spandam, I request an answer!

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,220
Give us your orders! Straw Hat Luffy won't stop!

16
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,290
On the other side, Zoro and the others who came in the Rocketman who were at the entrance...

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,820
...were waiting and preparing to break in.

18
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,580
This is bad! We're really gonna crash!

19
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,260
What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?

20
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,050
Dodge it, Kokoro-san!

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,910
No need to worry. There is a way.

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,640
They passed over the Main Gate and headed directly towards the Main Island Gate.

23
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,350
Wh-What are those two!?

24
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,600
Big Bazooka unit, advance!

25
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,890
If I don't hurry, Robin will...

26
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,480
Should I give it a go?

27
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,640
Give it up! Straw Hat!

28
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,690
Fire!!

29
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,880
Did we get him?

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,190
He fell in the waterfall!

31
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,650
Oi, look!

32
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,770
He's still clinging onto the cliff!

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,680
Straw Hat!

34
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,400
If you give up obediently, we may consider pulling you up...

35
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,390
As if I would!

36
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,600
What a stubborn one, just plummet into the waterfall!

37
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,600
Take this! Oi, everyone! Let go!

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,930
Oi, he went over there!

39
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,250
He's here, here!

40
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,450
Lucky!

41
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,470
It's the Straw Hat!

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,060
I ended up in such a crazy place.

43
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,920
Maa, I'll just have to take care of them all at once.

44
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,650
I guess I just have to aim for that great looking building.

45
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,850
Yosh!

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,420
He went there! Follow him!

47
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,940
It's heavy...

48
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,870
The ones on the bottom, try climbing on the middle ones...

49
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,490
Be careful... There...

50
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,700
Don't swing!

51
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,300
It's not me, the wind did 'fiuu' and...

52
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,860
Can the wind do such a thing!?

53
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Catch Up with Luffy! 
The Straw Hat Pirates' All-Out War

54
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,420
O-Oi! I know that swordsman!

55
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,140
He's the Straw Hat's underling, the Pirate Hunter Zoro!

56
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,730
You're an underling, they say.

57
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,490
Then aren't you lower than that? Pirate A.

58
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,370
Then B.

59
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,090
Bastard! When I get a bounty, yours will be insignifiant compared to mine!

60
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,050
Then C.

61
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,600
Listen to what people say!

62
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,810
Oi. Stop this, you two...

63
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,670
Sogeking, aren't you joining them?

64
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,850
This is part of my strategy too, Chopper-kun.

65
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,660
Ehh? So that's why...

66
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,380
They have nakama in the train!

67
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,480
We've been found out!

68
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,070
There should still be some inside! Blow them up before they come out!

69
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Oi, wait! Nami-san is still inside!

70
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,150
Fire!

71
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,610
That guy... I'll him three times over!

72
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,280
Hold on, Pirate A.

73
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,140
What? They're surely not dead.

74
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,900
It's because you don't know these kind of things that you're Pirate A.

75
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,990
You marimo...!

76
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Oh, that surpris-

77
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,440
Are you alright, Sogeking?

78
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm alright, Chopper-kun.

79
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,480
Cease fire!

80
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,130
What's wrong?

81
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,610
Look at this!

82
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,350
Oi!

83
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,360
Stop this, I'm just an old woman!

84
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,870
We're just a kid and a small animal! We're fragile!

85
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Being threatened by the Straw Hats, we were forced to pilot the train!

86
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
Pilot the train!

87
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,250
How could they have taken a drunk hostage!?

88
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,450
That was close... We were about to kill the hostages!

89
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,670
Plus, those cowardly pirates took an old woman, a kid, and a small animal as hostages...

90
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,630
What? It looks like some smoke is forming a cloud.

91
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,730
With cold balls...

92
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,420
and heat balls.

93
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,680
The moisture in the atmosphere condenses into clouds.

94
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,880
♥ Nami-swan! You were able to escape! ♥

95
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,610
Oi... The cloud is becoming bigger and bigger!

96
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,230
Baa-chan, baa-chan. The cloud is becoming big.

97
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,120
That cloud is a bit dangerous...

98
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,540
Chimney, Gonbe, come here.

99
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,600
As expected from the Perfect Clima Tact.

100
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,790
The cloud's length and speed is completely different from before!

101
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,910
I'll test it out!

102
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,700
The power of electricity!

103
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,890
What is she planning to do, that neechan?

104
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,290
It may be better to run away!

105
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,590
It's coming!

106
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,860
Baa-chan, baa-chan. This is great thunder, right?

107
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,980
She's something, that neechan.

108
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,140
Baa-chan, will we be alright just with this umbrella?

109
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,210
Trust baa-chan. We'll be okay if we stay here.

110
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,300
It's way too powerful! I'll die!

111
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,600
Waah! Sogeking!

112
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,030
Nami, why did you hit Sogeking!?

113
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,830
It's okay. I just felt like doing it.

114
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,980
It's not my fault! There's obviously something wrong with the way you used it!

115
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,650
Furthermore, Usopp-kun says he doesn't remember making it to be used that way!

116
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,100
But even so...

117
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,300
What power! It defeated most of them.

118
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,940
Damn you, Nami! What did you do that for!?

119
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,070
Apologize, Sogeking!

120
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,980
You apologize! Are you stupid!?

121
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,960
♥ Nami-san! It reminded me of the shock I felt when I first met you! ♥

122
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,100
What's wrong with that crew?

123
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,100
I thought that neechan was just there to support them, but it turns out that she's one of their main fighters!

124
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,710
Seems like it's over.

125
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,470
Pirate neechan, awesome, awesome!

126
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,960
Looks like baasan and the others are alright too!

127
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,280
That's because I've lived for so long!

128
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,970
By the way, where's that idiot who went in first?

129
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,010
I don't know...

130
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,840
This island is far from being small.

131
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,210
We'll have to search.

132
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,700
What?

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,080
He's definitely there!

134
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,180
And now...

135
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,200
Should we follow after him?

136
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,160
Those damn pirates are causing such a mess here!

137
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,150
Unforgivable!

138
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,590
He jumped on the top of the tree!

139
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,850
Those bastards... There's no end to this. I can't go on any further.

140
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,120
Oi, this way!

141
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,880
They're running in the opposite direction?

142
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,910
Send some of our men to the Main Island's Front Gate!

143
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,350
Pirates breached the gate and started invading! We must stop them!

144
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,340
They've arrived! That's great! Now we should have a lot of fun!

145
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,560
Yosh!

146
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,460
Too bad! You missed!

147
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,580
He's over there! Fire!

148
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,460
If I'm right, it was around there!

149
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,720
To let you go first is a bad idea!

150
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,630
Why's that!?

151
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,500
It's alright, we just have to go straight!

152
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,150
Geez, that idiot just rushed in there alone without thinking of the consequences.

153
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,490
Maa, we're quite the idiots too, since we decided to follow that moron.

154
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,020
Anyway, because of Luffy, the Marines seem to have dispersed.

155
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,920
For now, we just have to head directly to the Courthouse!

156
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,250
Ah, this won't do! My illness is returning!

157
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,010
If you want to die you can stay here!

158
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,940
I'm cured!

159
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,730
I prefer that!

160
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,510
What's wrong?

161
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,450
We have clients.

162
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,860
Given the duty of protecting the Front Gate, we're the Houbantai.

163
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,710
Nobody can break through this line!

164
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,040
Give up, you villains!

165
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,230
This time it's dog policemen?

166
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,920
Don't think it's just us, pirates!

167
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,760
We're completly surrounded.

168
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,100
If you look around, there are way too many enemies!

169
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,110
Saa, it's time to pay your debts, pirates.

170
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,560
What about it?

171
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,400
Talking so eminently...

172
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,660
Guys, atta-!

173
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,430
Grab it!

174
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,920
You could let us have some fun...

175
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,600
Idiot!

176
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't forget your main reason for coming here!

177
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,170
This isn't the place for you to fight!

178
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,090
It's true, that against such numbers we'd be there until the sun sets.

179
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,670
Aren't they full of energy?

180
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,110
Don't die!

181
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,440
Charge in!

182
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,940
Soldiers, get away!

183
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,580
They're Kingbulls from Water 7! Be careful when dealing with them!

184
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,400
Shit!

185
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,600
Eat this!

186
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,530
We're charging at you once again!

187
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,430
Houbantai, reform the line!

188
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,420
We won't let you! Our dogs' legs won't lose to those fish!

189
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,160
It's bad! They're catching up!

190
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,220
No way!

191
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,220
Can't we go any faster?

192
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,560
Oi, cook niichan.

193
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:46,890
There are too many!

194
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:50,930
What's wrong?

195
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,330
I leave the bridle to you.

196
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,090
You guys are...

197
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,430
If you meet...

198
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,860
...with those guys, give them this message.

199
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,570
You're fired.

200
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,520
Absolutely.

201
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,330
Jump on it!

202
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,690
We won't let you!

203
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,650
We'll leave this to you, Galley-La!

204
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,770
We're gonna skewer you!

205
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,240
The Houbantai were beaten!

206
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,850
Eh! Those fools let their guard down!

207
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,100
No ordinary human can keep up with our movements! Go!

208
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,870
Before they can even notice!

209
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,140
Impale them!

210
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,090
They were beaten again!

211
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,490
Wh-What are those guys?

212
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,870
They are so strong!

213
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,830
We'll take care of this place.

214
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,850
Take this!

215
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,140
Your temperament hasn't changed since that time, Cutty Flam.

216
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,740
If only I had known earlier that you were still alive and holding the blueprints...

217
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,270
I wouldn't have had to search and suffer.

218
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,750
In your case, to control you with your past sins

219
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,930
would have been extremly easy.

220
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,110
Right!?

221
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,790
On the other hand...

222
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,610
Your brother Iceberg was a lot of trouble.

223
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,270
As Tom's apprentice, he united the shipbuilding yards of Water 7 into just one,

224
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,780
and then put them into one major company.

225
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,740
He took the initiative to ally with the World Government he was supposed to hate.

226
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,480
Before too long, his company became a well established provider for the World Government.

227
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,160
He became president of the Galley-La shipbuilding company,

228
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,090
and then the mayor of the water capital, Water 7.

229
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,350
He became an indispensable person for the Government, that nobody would doubt.

230
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,740
This meant we couldn't do anything against him.

231
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,510
Bastard! Aren't you providing the World Government with ships!?

232
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,550
Don't joke with me! I will absolutely not forgive you!

233
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,100
That's why he made a deal with the Government.

234
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,880
That guy <i>was</i>  an intelligent man.

235
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,590
However, the wind started blowing my way!

236
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,710
It was when I was about to shake off my numbness and reinforce my plans that...

237
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,690
I received great news from Admiral Ao Kiji!

238
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:23,910
Saying that the infamous Nico Robin was boarding a pirate ship and heading for Water 7.

239
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,040
To calm myself a bit, I took a cup of coffee.

240
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,550
Including the permission to use the Buster Call, I added all the information to my plan.

241
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,690
Even if there were some changes in my scenario...

242
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:39,940
Look!

243
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,940
The triggers of the ancient weapons' revival

244
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,600
are both here at this moment!

245
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,160
Do you understand?

246
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,990
The whole world's winds are blowing in my direction at this moment!

247
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,920
If I so wished, the ability to rule any powerful country I want is now in my own control!

248
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,420
Why did Ao Kiji give you the power of the Buster Call?

249
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,680
Don't you dare question me!

250
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,330
You insolent bitch!

251
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:48,370
If it wasn't for me, the value of your existence would be nothing!

252
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,470
You should be thanking me!

253
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,160
As you hold the dirty blood of the land of evil, Ohara!

254
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,560
Nico Robin.

255
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:32,380
If it wasn't for me, the value of your existence would be nothing.

256
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,940
You should be thanking me.

257
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,050
As you hold the dirty blood of the land of evil, Ohara.

258
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,130
Nico Robin.

259
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:18,000
Robin was Betrayed! 
The Expectations of the World Government!"

260
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,830
Alright, listen well.

261
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,020
From now on, you'll suffer so much pain that you'll tell yourself countless times that you'd prefer death.

262
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,690
You better get ready.

263
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,030
I'll hurt you so much. I'll use you, and then I'll cast you out at sea!

264
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,280
Your existence is sinful to that extent!

265
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,020
Ah, speaking of which. We just got some news.

266
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,810
I received a report saying that the idiot who invaded this place because he wanted to get you back so bad is here...

267
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,010
Impossible...

268
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,490
It's no big deal! They should all have been captured by now.

269
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,910
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew.

270
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,210
What stubborn people they are...

271
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,290
They are like garbage in front of the ten thousand Marines of Enies Lobby.

272
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,370
Anyway, I was just about to send a ship to the prisons.

273
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,240
That's perfect for a souvenir.

274
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,970
I plan on sending them to Impel Down, as well as Cutty Flam.

275
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,480
Wait! Isn't that different to our arrangement!?

276
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,400
The condition in order for me to collaborate with you was to let them get away safely!

277
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,130
What are you standing up so vehemently for?

278
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,020
Lucci! Tell her the exact conditions we gave.

279
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,010
That the six Straw Hats excluding Nico Robin,

280
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,250
would be able to set out of Water 7 safely.

281
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,450
Yeah... That's how it is.

282
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,830
There's no error in that, right?

283
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,770
Didn't they set off from Water 7 safely, and then come here?

284
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,770
What did you say?

285
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,160
Don't tell me you're going to break our arrangement over such a technicality!?

286
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,910
This is desperately dirty.

287
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,640
They don't even have a fragment of humanity!

288
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,280
Ah? What did you say?

289
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,830
Shut up, you trash!

290
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,000
We don't even have the obligation to keep our promises with criminals like you!

291
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,380
Take this, take this, bastard!

292
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,660
You too!

293
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,450
Don't become so cocky!

294
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,770
To deceive pirates and capture them is naturally what the Marines do!

295
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,280
Coward...

296
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,630
To think you'd still be talking so impudently...

297
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,000
Rest assured that I'll choose an ideal death, for a woman who lived by betraying others until now.

298
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,680
All of you should get along well and then die.

299
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,840
In front of the great justice, resistance is futile.

300
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,450
Pursue him! Don't let them escape!

301
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,160
There's only one enemy, encircle him!

302
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,510
Stop!

303
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,270
Don't get in my way!

304
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
You bastards!

305
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,990
Commander, he's scary!

306
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,010
Don't falter, fools!

307
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,150
Go!

308
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,070
Commander!

309
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,060
Over there... It looks like a dead-end.

310
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,510
Don't be taken away yet...

311
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,330
ROBIN!!

312
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,230
Alright, guards. Lead those two by their chains and take them away.

313
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,070
Make sure that Nico Robin's sea stone ward doesn't loosen.

314
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,050
Cutty Flam goes to Impel Down.

315
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,880
Nico Robin goes to the Marine Headquarters.

316
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,870
As soon as the departure preparations are done

317
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,160
take them through the Gate of Justice.

318
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,100
Yes. Understood.

319
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,270
And...

320
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
I have something to tell you.

321
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,630
Cutty Flam is extremly vio-

322
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,170
Did the Straw Hat appear?

323
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,400
Help me, oi, Kalifa!

324
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
That's sexual harassment.

325
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,500
We've just gotten a report about this, chapapa.

326
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,790
The Chief got so distracted by the news that it was embarrassing.

327
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,390
But at that time, the report stated that only five people were down.

328
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,840
The receiver is off the hook.

329
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,440
Don't give us any trouble!

330
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,730
Start walking!

331
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,360
The CP9 can now return to their private rooms.

332
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,250
The credit we'll receive for this case will surely be enormous.

333
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,350
How about it? We could raise our glasses for our accomplishments on the ship.

334
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,720
I'm not in the mood for a toast.

335
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,590
Since we have no interest in social status nor political influence...

336
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,920
Our justice is to assassinate for the World Government.

337
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,110
As long as the government recognizes you as the CP9's commandant,

338
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,880
and until we complete this mission completely...

339
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,810
We don't have any obligation to approve your ideas.

340
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,370
That's a fair argument...

341
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,360
Then what are you guys searching for?

342
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,580
Blood.

343
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,300
But you see...

344
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,770
By being here, we get the legitimate rights to kill.

345
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,530
It gives me the chills...

346
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,260
This is truly the government's only assassin group.

347
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,740
My subordinates are such promising guys...

348
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,610
As long as they're here, I don't feel like I could lose to anyone!

349
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,040
Oi, what's happening over there?

350
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,730
Something is coming!

351
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,570
Yosh! Sodom, Gomorrah! Continue rushing forward!

352
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,050
Shit! So it's them!

353
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,260
They're the pirates who broke through the Main Island's Gate!

354
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,000
Fire! Shoot them down!

355
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,830
If you want your lives, open the way!

356
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,230
Try to get into formation again!

357
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,990
Pirate scum shouldn't get so cocky!

358
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,490
Get ready, pirate!

359
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,620
Go to hell!

360
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,230
He's our captain, his will is strong!

361
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,630
Get us to Luffy on the Main Island, Kingbull!

362
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,940
There are still so many. There's no end, damn it!

363
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,070
I'm cornered!

364
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,830
He's going to your side!

365
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,200
It's the Straw Hat! Capture him!

366
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,030
Don't let him go any further!

367
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,200
I've gotta search for Robin quickly!

368
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,890
But I can hardly move forward like this!

369
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,840
Catch him in a pincer attack!

370
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,070
He entered a side street. Pursue him!

371
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,410
Damn, he escaped to the roofs!

372
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,140
Wait!

373
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,140
They're persistent! There's no end to this.

374
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,900
Don't let him get away!

375
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,010
Just give up!

376
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,760
Yosh. I'll go there in one shot.

377
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,740
You won't get away!

378
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,490
Stop him!

379
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,810
See ya!

380
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,850
Shit! Damn pirate...

381
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,260
Don't let the pirates proceed any further!

382
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,350
Stop them!

383
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,450
Kill all of them!

384
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,770
Fire! Bring those Marines down!

385
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,810
You bastards!

386
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,160
I understand!

387
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,370
And then, just when they were about to die in the stomach of a gigantic Sea King,

388
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,680
the two brothers, Sodom and Gomorrha, were rescued by the Franky Family and told this:

389
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,230
"We're full now, so we won't eat you!"

390
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,920
From that time on, they swore loyalty to their savior Franky!

391
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,800
No, that's not it...

392
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:49,420
It's just a story about them being in the stomach of a Sea King the Franky Family just happened to be eating.

393
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,730
Probably.

394
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,640
Mah, it's okay...

395
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,730
Could you look in front of you? That's dangerous.

396
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,300
"I will follow Franky-aniki for the rest of my life!", he says.

397
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,200
He must be quite happy that you can understand what he says.

398
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,950
"By the way, the masked guy who was with you didn't come aboard, is that okay?", he says.

399
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,130
Sogeking is nowhere to be seen!

400
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,280
Why, why!?

401
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,800
That guy... Did he fall off?

402
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,820
No! Now that you mention it, he's not been here from the start!

403
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,180
Don't tell me he ran away...

404
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,860
You jerk! Don't stand in our way forever!

405
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,720
Stop this and let us pass!

406
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,140
If you want to pass, do it after beating me!

407
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,160
Move...

408
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,100
...from there!

409
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,080
It won't happen so easily!

410
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,310
Shit! Do something about those three!

411
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,230
You... You are strong when you fight, right?

412
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,170
Can you win against them?

413
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,140
I can win!

414
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,390
When hesitating, anybody can get weak!

415
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:00,960
From the moment they know it's okay to save her, their strength won't know any limit!

416
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,160
I'm gonna kick their asses!

417
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,240
And I have a technique I want to try!

418
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,350
If it's him, he'll surely...

419
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,860
Kill that rope bastard!

420
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,220
It won't go your way!

421
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,640
We're done for!

422
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,570
This is a dead-end.

423
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,230
Just give up.

424
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,380
M-Major! It's terrible!

425
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,000
What's wrong!?

426
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,750
Straw Hat Luffy...

427
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,630
We've lost sight of Straw Hat Luffy!

428
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,850
How could something so impossible happen!?

429
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,410
How many Marines do you think there are here!?

430
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,170
But... He's not anywhere!

431
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,010
Could it be... Maybe he's already inside the Courthouse?

432
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,390
No! We didn't even let a bug pass!

433
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,870
Search for him! We absolutely must track down the Straw Hat!

434
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,230
So this is the last building...

435
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,360
Yosh.

436
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,960
But there isn't even a bridge...

437
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,800
It's a bit far, but I can try flying there.

438
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,540
What?

439
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,300
Ah! You're the cow who was with the pigeon guy!

440
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,020
It seems there are some mistakes between the information and the actual situation.

441
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,100
Hey! How did you do that just now?

442
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,180
Awesome! Is there a trick?

443
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,990
I thought the information about the damage report being just five was wrong...

444
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,720
Ehh! Surprised me!

445
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,690
Since the beggining of the World Government, this is the first time this has happened.

446
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,190
To have a man sneak up to the entrance of the Government.

447
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,740
Move from there, cow.

448
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,890
Until when...

449
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,790
...do you plan on fighting?

450
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,100
Until I die.

451
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,430
I am a rubber man!

452
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,170
Gomu Gomu fruit user, Monkey D. Luffy.

453
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:05,360
First of all, let's get a look at what we are expecting to see, the many talented techniques Luffy uses by stretching himself!

454
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,270
Luffy-san!

455
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,410
Straw Hat!

456
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,340
Exchange!

457
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:06,960
And...

458
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,310
Yosh!

459
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,470
Oh, this is bad! I'm leaking water!

460
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,870
That brat... Is he serious?

461
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,090
I shouldn't drink so much water...

462
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,170
He got tremendrous power because of the Devil Fruit's ability.

463
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,790
But how did Luffy get that power?

464
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Stuffing it down, Luffy?

465
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,730
That's right!

466
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,190
What are you eating!?

467
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,100
Was it that box!? Did you eat what was inside that box!?

468
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,770
Throw up! Throw it up immediately! Everything you ate!

469
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,940
What are you doing, Shanks?

470
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,700
What was that? Just now...

471
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,420
What you just ate was the Gomu Gomu fruit!

472
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,730
The Gomu Gomu fruit is also called a Devil Fruit! After eating it, you'll become a rubber man!

473
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,170
And you'll have a body that can't swim for the rest of your life!

474
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,920
Help me!

475
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,920
Shanks!

476
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,040
Get lost.

477
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,540
Oi, don't cry. You're a man, right?

478
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,310
But, Shanks...

479
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,570
Your arm!

480
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,070
It's a cheap price to pay. It's only an arm.

481
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,450
I'm glad you're safe.

482
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,200
You're going, right?

483
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,550
Yeah. We docked here for a long time, but it's time to say farewell.

484
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,470
You'll miss us, right?

485
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,140
Yes, I guess I'll miss you.

486
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,370
But I won't ask you to take me with you anymore.

487
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,400
I decided to become one by myself. A pirate.

488
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,700
I wouldn't have taken you with me anyway!

489
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,380
As if someone like you could become a pirate!

490
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,230
I will!

491
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,440
Someday I'll gather nakama that won't lose to this crew, I'll find the best treasure in the world!

492
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,330
And I'll become it! The Pirate King!

493
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,690
Oh. So, you're going to surpass us.

494
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:30,920
Then...

495
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,570
I'll leave this hat in your care.

496
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,750
It's my important hat.

497
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,340
Take good care of it.

498
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,500
Someday... You must return it to me.

499
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,090
After becoming a great pirate.

500
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,930
It's a promise, Luffy.

501
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:21,040
Before long, Luffy grew up and set out to the sea with the straw hat of the promise.

502
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,600
And then, those he met during his journey were...

503
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,240
Zoro,

504
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,090
Nami,

505
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,230
Usopp,

506
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,600
and Sanji.

507
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,520
Leave the covering to me!

508
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,600
For Luffy, they are as important as his hat, they are his trustworthy nakama.

509
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,100
That's right. We have to talk about that.

510
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,440
Would you make a contract with me?

511
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,900
A contract?

512
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,490
Stop fighting!

513
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,330
Anyway, they were his trustworthy nakama!

514
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,390
The initial bounty will be of $30,000,000, which may prove to be a world record.

515
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,760
But I don't think it is too high.

516
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,770
It's better to take care of such evil quickly before they expand further.

517
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,910
Absolutely.

518
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,000
Wanted dead or alive... $30,000,000!?

519
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,630
$30,000,000 it says!

520
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:13,550
Look at this! The back of my head is known all across the world!

521
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,750
Luffy got a bounty soon after becoming a pirate.

522
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:22,820
Luffy aims for the one true treasure, One Piece, with Wealth, Fame and Power.

523
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,830
And he breaks into the great sea's Grand Line with his nakama.

524
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,910
This isn't the time to be taking it so easy in East Blue.

525
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,520
Look at that light!

526
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,000
Is it the lighthouse of an island?

527
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,420
This is the guiding light. Grand Line's entrance is waiting past this light.

528
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,010
Grand Line is just past there...

529
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:48,980
What do we do?

530
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,980
But is it really safe in the middle of such a storm?

531
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,690
Alright! But before setting our ship in the greatest sea, how about we have a launching ceremony?

532
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,530
Oi!

533
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,750
Yeah! That's good!

534
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,500
Let's do it!

535
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,530
I'm going there to find All Blue.

536
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,530
To become the Pirate King!

537
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,790
To become the greatest swordman!

538
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,330
To draw a map of the world.

539
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,160
I... I am...

540
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,710
It's to become a brave warrior of the sea!

541
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,310
Let's go! To the Grand Line!

542
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,230
Get out of my way.

543
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,160
What do you think invading the World Government mea-

544
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:21,780
MOVE!

545
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,200
Next time, One Piece: Give Robin Back!
Luffy vs Blueno!

546
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,170
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

547
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,160
Here's the way to get your present!

548
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:38,670
Write the four letters that appeared in the show, your address, your full name, your age,

549
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,240
your opinion of the show and you may win a lot of prizes!

550
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,510
This is the last keyword!

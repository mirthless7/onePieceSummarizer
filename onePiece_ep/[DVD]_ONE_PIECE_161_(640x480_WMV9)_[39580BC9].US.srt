1
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,660
He!

2
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,060
Ground here…

3
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,950
It is ground.

4
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,730
Oh, it is true. The celestial island east
manufactured starting from îlonimbus.

5
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,990
Then, why this
is island different?

6
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,910
I believe that is really worth
the sorrow to explore this place.

7
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,820
Your chances of survival in
the Lost Forest are of 10%.

8
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,270
Ordalie of the Bubbles!

9
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,120
Come now, if you made not quickly, your boat will be inserted very far in the Lost Forest!

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,610
H-He, it is necessary to catch up with it
boat or one will lose sight of the fact it!

11
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,939
I will give a lesson to the large heap!

12
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,249
Pay attention!

13
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,209
This type has odd capacities!

14
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,389
I will return as soon as
I will have the boat!

15
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,170
Ok!

16
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,769
GOMU GOMU NO…

17
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,520
GUN!!

18
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,529
GOMU GOMU NO…

19
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,030
MUCHI! [Muchi = Whip]

20
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,030
And still!

21
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,040
Shit! I cannot see it from here.

22
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,289
Make attention, Luffy!

23
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,509
These Priests are not ordinary!

24
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,000
It is necessary to find the boat and
to release from here as quickly as possible!

25
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:21,340
The danger of Ordalie of the Bubbles!
Fights died in the Drill Lost

26
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,960
Take your time for you
to release! Have fun!

27
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,470
Where are the two different ones now?

28
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,440
Nobody must escape.

29
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,700
In here one.

30
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,619
He!

31
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,220
You can see it, Usopp?!

32
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,779
I see it!

33
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,849
Say me moreover it!

34
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,189
It is right in front of you!

35
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,899
Climb on the second
tree after that one!

36
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,059
This branch will allow you
to reach the boat!

37
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,360
Ca rolls!

38
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,919
Here it is!

39
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,400
What goes it
to make?

40
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,880
Release!

41
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,739
ATTENTION, SANJI!

42
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,369
A bubble sinks right on you!

43
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,169
What?!

44
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,820
But what it fout, Luffy?!

45
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,460
Attacks Surprised Bubble!

46
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,060
Usopp!!

47
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,030
It IS ME WHOM IT AIMED?!!!

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,000
It will explode…

49
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,960
Ca wants to say what “Pon”?!

50
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,820
Failures, hein?

51
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,040
CRETIN!!!

52
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,190
SPECIES Of DUMB!

53
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,610
GOMU GOMU NO GATLING GUN!!!

54
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,100
DECREE, LUFFY!

55
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,520
Do not touch only one of these bubbles!

56
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,249
What?

57
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,829
What!? What?!

58
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,650
MEEERDE! It IS TOO LATE!

59
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,259
Pay to!

60
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,250
They rebound in all the directions!

61
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,340
What a band of clowns!

62
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,529
Lances!

63
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,350
A crab!

64
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,260
Four at the same time!

65
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,089
Hein?

66
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,789
Still failures?

67
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,810
Not, one would not say…

68
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,679
It is well that?!

69
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,549
What?

70
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,919
You want that I sing with you?

71
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,579
Ok, then be not astonished!

72
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,879
Me am called the Singing Pirate.

73
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,850
Well.

74
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,460
I did not sing yet!

75
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,549
HEAT!

86
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,059
Luffy!

87
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,609
Do not fall into this river!

88
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,280
It surely does not have basic!

89
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,250
Of accuracy!

90
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,120

[Note:Wagomu = elastic]

95
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,040
usopp hammer!

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,959
Oh yes! Ca gives me an idea!

97
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,210
It is the moment to test
the small last!

98
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,000
Would not have you an idea, Usopp?!

99
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,289
Of course that if!

100
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,390
Me am called the Large Inventive Pirate!

101
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,990
You will discover my
all new weapon!

102
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,860

103
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,959
It is what this trick?

104
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh, admires that!

105
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,939
Here it is!

106
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,010
It is on the river just opposite.

107
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,539
I can arrive there!

108
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,790
Set Up!

109
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,870
What does it make?

110
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,750
Perfect. Here is a way
direct towards the Small Corbel.

111
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,159
If it still moves away in
forest, it will be out of reach.

112
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,420
I am not entitled to the error!

113
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,569
It is not a bad idea!

114
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,189
But pay attention to the bubbles!

115
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,159
I am already with the current.

116
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,469
Call me the King of the Jungle!

117
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,009
I go there!

118
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,320
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

119
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,570
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

120
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,300
I go there!

121
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,909
Good!

122
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,070
It IS PARTIIIT!

123
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,549
Super! Perfect trajectory!

124
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,860
Now, goes up on
boat and cut the engine!

125
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,939
That there
it has?!

126
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,469
Go up quickly on the boat!

127
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,770
Not, it is…!

128
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,929
On this subject…!

129
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,309
I forgot…

130
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,140
The cord is fixed at my belt,
I cannot take down it!

131
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,440
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

132
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,800
Still a little! I can the attrap…

133
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,889
Yo, Usopp!

134
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,090
You ace air you to burst, you too!

135
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,960
'Is necessary that I speak to you, both.

136
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,469
Included/understood?

137
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,769
I will pass sponge on your stupid things.

138
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,679
But you will listen to me henceforth.

139
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,729
Excavated, décholé. (Yes, sorry.)

140
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,430
Boi auchi. (Me too.)

141
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,400
Let us forget the boat for the moment.

142
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,290
With us three, we owe it
to put K.O in only one blow.

143
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,569
I insane that it is one
Priest or anything.

144
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,090
If we attack together, it us
an opening will leave inevitably.

145
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,290
To put K.O to me. ?

146
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,550
Where did it pass?

147
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,110
Impact!

148
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,600
SANJI!!

149
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,700
The life is only suffering.

150
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,320
And now, more than two.

151
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,460
Thank you.

152
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,829
He, you did not see some
thing to move over there?

153
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,360
Not really.

154
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,530
Don't He, you have anything considering, Robin?

155
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
Not, I do not have anything considering.

156
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,979
It was probably one
monkey or a trick like that.

157
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,839
A monkey?

158
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Perhaps…

159
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,339
Good, must we check
on the other side of bank?

160
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,140
Not! And if one were still done
to attack by sharks?!

161
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,210
Whore, but is it what your problem?

162
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,600
I cannot reach it…

163
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,510
But I promised in Zoro
to try to repair the boat…

164
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,730
Go! I must better do my.

165
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,749
I hope that they do not see me.

166
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,089
Gently…

167
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,879
Gently…

168
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,780
Gently…

169
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,880
Gently…

170
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,429
I have it!

171
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,320
I can repair the boat now!

172
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,710
The whistle!

173
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,810
You will have only with
to blow extremely in it.

174
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,690
I will descend from the Paradise itself
to fly to your help.

175
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,959
In normal weather, I make pay my
interventions 5 Million Extols…

176
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,009
But exceptionally, I you
fact gift of a whistle.

177
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,799
Wait!

178
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,510
Tell us at least your name!

179
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,129
I am the Knight of the Sky, Gan Fall!

180
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,340
And here my companion, Pierre!

181
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,060
That the chance is with
you, courageous hearts!

182
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,609
How one will make to go up, then?

183
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,109
I know! I will call it
grandfather and to ask him!

184
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,999
ATT…

185
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,789
Have-HAVE-HAVE-HAve-await,
Luffy, stop!

186
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,189
It is only to require
of the assistance in the event of urgency!

187
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,570
And if the odd guy with
its mask was repointait?!

188
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,079
Listen to me!

189
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,770
I decided that I
will keep the whistle on me.

190
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,780
An objection?

191
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,279
Yes.

192
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,370
Yes! Yes! Yes!

193
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,219
How can you say that!?

194
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,919
I am a fragile little girl!

195
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,369
You?

196
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,759
I am the only one to whom it must return!

197
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,059
I want to call it…

198
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,760
Not question, Luffy! You want just
to blow in this foutu whistle!

199
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,759
Remain apart from that!

200
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,659
I want to call it
grandfather! He is cool!

201
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,009
Give it to me!

202
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,869
I am weakest!

203
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,079
Anything! It is me,
weakest of all!

204
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,380
Stop your conneries! Everyone
How I KNOW am weakest!

205
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,679
Not, I am weakest!

206
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,720
You ever noticed how much
I was magnificiently can with the combat?!

207
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,340
They need little of it to fight…

208
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,859
Very well, here it
that we will make.

209
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,319
In the middle of the boat.

210
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,120
I hang it on the mast. In the event of
danger, no matter who will be able to use it.

211
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,919
It is equitable like that.

212
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,619
Ok.

213
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,890
Of agreement.

214
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,129
Oh, and another thing.

215
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,169
None you has it
right to blow inside.

216
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,769
Bah, I want to call the grandfather…

217
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,869
Use it and I dispatch you with the other
boils of the world of a kick to the bottom!

218
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,730
Ok, one will remember it.

219
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,689
B-good.

220
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,549
I prefer to keep it on me.

221
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,440
Now, if I am in danger, it
Knight of the Sky will come to my help.

222
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,410
But… the whistle is
my last recourse.

223
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,189
PERFECT!

224
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,600
I will better do my
to occupy me of the boat!

225
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,350
It is what?

226
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,289
How?

227
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,300
You are the only sacrifice for
which I moved?

228
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,900
Stone slabs?

229
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,810
While continuing in this direction,
perhaps other indices will be found.

230
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,100
He, you do not have anything
heard at the moment?

231
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,890
If. Do not move any more.

232
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,640
YOU WILL STOP YOUR CONNERIES?!!

233
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,220
It is not your day of chance, hein?

234
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,430
Remain on your guards.

235
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,160
Thank you…

236
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,520
Usopp!

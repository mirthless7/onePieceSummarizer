1
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:58,555
And on my line…

2
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:02,354
Originating in East-Blue, it is the captain
of small but frightening crew…

3
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,287
Its head is worth 100 million berrys…

4
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:07,420
Called the Straw hat!

5
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:10,488
MONKEY D. LUFFY!!

6
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:19,621
And to crown the whole, Luffy covered
the Afro cut to enter on the scene!

7
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:22,488
Go ahead Luffy!

8
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,355
It is which him?

9
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,821
The gong sounded!

10
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,288
Here me is!

11
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,421
Y' has that my hand which is slowed down!

12
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,488
I would not do that in your place!

13
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:02,155
That one either.

14
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,688
I had warned you…

15
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:25,821
Luffy…

16
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,421
It is not possible…

17
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:39,580
NORO NORO BEAM WITH FULL THROTTLE
VS LUFFY the INVULNERABLE one

18
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,021
Oh! What a impressive explosion!

19
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:49,488
When it is thought that the boat is
become the battle field by chance…

20
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,821
And that these Foxy Face Bombs have
summer left there by sheer coincidence!

21
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:56,554
“By chance”? It is prohibited what they did!

22
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,555
Dirty cheaters!

23
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,687
Hey Luffy! How is what occurred?!

24
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:01,888
calm you…
Hey Luffy! How is what occurred?!

25
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,954
The bombs were judiciously
used by our Oyabin…

26
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,821
to trap Luffy with the Straw hat
in an enormous explosion!

27
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,755
Thin… Luffy is…

28
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:14,755
Would this be the end?

29
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,488
I do not see it any more…

30
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,888
Waaa… it was less one!

31
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,755
Yes, it was really a dangerous attack.

32
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:27,155
What you ace you? The farm!

33
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:31,688
One would say that Luffy to the Hat
of Straw is always in life!

34
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,287
Serious?

35
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,688
Frightening…

36
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:39,621
It had to escape right before the explosion!

37
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,220
What a incredible speed!

38
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:45,621
It is thus that, the force of a man of which
is the head worth 100 million berrys?

39
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:46,554
Of course how it is that!

40
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:48,288
Hurry to finish it!
Of course how it is that!

41
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:10,621
Wait! It would be said that Oyabin
prepare one second offensive!

42
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:19,688
That made cold in the back, the voice of Oyabin resounds
through the smoke of the explosion…

43
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:22,088
By where it will attack?

44
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,955
Which Foxy plan the Silver fox
it has scheme against its adversary?!

45
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,288
His shade is seen!

46
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,687
Then? You ace fear now hein?

47
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:41,288
You exploded yourself all alone?!

48
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,020
OF COURSE THAT NOT!

49
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:44,488
BA-KA!!

50
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:46,020
LIAR!!

51
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:49,821
Dumb! I will not let myself leave this alive boat!

52
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:57,355
I will break you the arm so that
you donot can use this ray any more!

53
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,755
It is turned over in this smoke…

54
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,821
Be to you thus there!!

55
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:08,488
It is what this trick?

56
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:22,954
Then? Where am I?

57
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:26,221
From where the ray will leave?

58
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,554
How I would know it?

59
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,421
They have all of the heads of morons!

60
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,221
Head of moron…

61
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:39,555
I found you!!

62
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:46,954
DUMB!!

63
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,954
You ACE NOT OF HEART OR WHAT?!

64
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,555
I will never forgive myself it! Look at up there!

65
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:00,087
Shit! A trap door!

66
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,488
You do not should have looked at elsewhere!

67
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,488
It IS YOU WHO Me ACE KNOWN AS TO LOOK IN TOP!

68
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,288
You would make better remain on your guards…

69
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:11,354
Hum? Hein? What…

70
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,621
Ah! But the ground moves!!

71
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,220
Hey, it is Luffy!

72
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,088
What does it make over there?

73
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,355
Oh not! If it falls to water it is foutu!

74
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:27,488
You do not believe nevertheless who I will fall so easily!

75
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:31,488
It was right!

76
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:36,220
The spectacle would have been wasted
if that had finished like that!

77
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,888
Go ahead thoroughly, Straw hat!

78
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:43,088
But it is what this boat?! Fact of shitting!

79
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,288
Where you hide, salts fox?!

80
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:54,155
Oh! While Luffy with the Straw hat
was not there, Foxy addressed an invitation to him!

81
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,154
It is there!

82
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:00,888
Oyabin will succeed in it cramming Luffy
with the Straw hat towards the interior?

83
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:03,087
Luffy, does not go there! It is surely a lure!

84
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:05,421
There are other traps inside!

85
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,955
What a dumb! I go him botter the bottom!

86
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:14,554
Luffy seems to accept the invitation.
They are now inside the boat!

87
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,954
I cannot return there, therefore we will not know
not what occurs! It is pure combat!

88
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:22,021
The true combat with death will be able to start!

89
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,954
Move! Move, Luffy!

90
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,355
Do not forget your intensive drives!

91
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,955
Close and sit down it, you see more anything.

92
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:31,954
The room of the guns?

93
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,620
It is really large…

94
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,821
Usopp would have liked to see that.

95
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:38,221
Where you cushy jobs?

96
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,555
Ah! Over there!

97
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,888
Yosh, they is good it will come…

98
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:53,221
It will insert the door at full speed…

99
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,488
And then, it will be cooked!!

100
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:01,155
It will be made transpierce in this room filled with peaks!

101
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:05,488
Then, you will come or N

102
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:18,621
Ah. You stays there.

103
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:21,354
It is what this room?

104
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:24,888
HEALTHY PEOPLE Of SPIRIT DO NOT DRAW
PAS AU CANON DANS UN BATEAU!!

105
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,155
Ah. It returns.

106
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,821
You will pay it expensive to me!

107
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:42,688
You will see of what a wood I heat yourself!

108
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,555
Ah! He flees!

109
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,488
Wait!!

110
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,955
Well, it will come here and I will be able to finish some!

111
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:56,921
Well… “Foxy Shichihenge”…
[Shichihenge:Disguise]

112
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,888
Wait, fox!

113
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:03,020
A lady?

114
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:04,888
Ma~! What is there?

115
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,888
You have some share badly?

116
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,888
Where do you have badly? With the head?

117
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,354
Does your head hurt you?

118
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,155
What… did you see somebody passing?

119
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:16,021
Not, not really. But more important…

120
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,021
Where do you have badly?

121
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:19,288
With the face?

122
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,487
Really odd… I was sure…

123
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:24,620
He, wait a little…

124
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:26,621
This lady resembled to him bloody!

125
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,221
Not possible!

126
00:10:33,355 --> 00:10:36,155
HE YOU!! TU SERAIS PAS SA SISTER?!!

127
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,221
Imbecile!!

128
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,421
But it is what that?!

129
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:50,687
It is super odd!

130
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:53,421
Then it had really entered this room…

131
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:56,088
He wants to fight or not!?

132
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:58,555
Oh! Kitchen!

133
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:03,621
Cut bienz the poiz-zon, cut it, cut to it bienz…

134
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:08,488
Make-Zen of the carpazzio… vinegar and zucre…
And eat morzeau by morzeau…

135
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:11,422
Huh? You zavez hunger?

136
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:15,688
You would not have seen large weak with
a head of puzzle by chance?

137
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:19,155
It is too for me…

138
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,555
It IS YOU!!

139
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,954
The nurse, it was me too!

140
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:25,888
PAS POSSIBLE!!

141
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,422
Et~ merde~!

142
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:41,155
Do not imagine that I made you come up to now without reason.

143
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:46,822
You know what there is in this room?

144
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,955
I you will show it… it is not alive, however.

145
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:53,622
It would be contrary with the rules, is not this step?

146
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:08,688
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

147
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:15,755
MUGIWARA-TEAM

148
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,437
When the effects of Noro Noro Beam stop…

149
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,172
the energy accumulated by my fists will create an explosion.

150
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:28,971
Go, go away.

151
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,905
It is here that your voyage is completed.

152
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,838
The 30 seconds are past.

153
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,838
It left…

154
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:58,305
If it is me whom you seek, I am just there!

155
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,372
Luffy.

156
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,905
It is what this odd behavior?

157
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,372
I am Foxy the pilot!

158
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,904
Let to me present itself…

159
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,704
“Gorilla Puncher N 13”.

160
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:29,905
This ultimate “Gorilla Puncher” is the result
of long series of improvements.

161
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,771
And it is you the mug of gorilla!?

162
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:37,105
ronche of gorilla L Mug of gorilla L
Mug of gorilla L

163
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:41,904
You had me!

164
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,372
The farm!

165
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:44,971
Deal with your business!

166
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:48,505
Ahead, “Gorilla Puncher N 13”!!

167
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:56,572
How it makes to advance this trick?

168
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,705
This machine is excellent!

169
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,905
It must sweat like an ox.

170
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,105
Buckle it!

171
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:10,038
You undoubtedly believe yourself able
to dodge its punches, not truth?

172
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,505
You aim who, there?

173
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,238
Look behind you!

174
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,304
The dumb! A mirror!

175
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,838
Eh yes! My rays are reflected in the mirrors!

176
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,238
I hold you!

177
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:38,037
I touched you? I touched you?!

178
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:41,437
I forgot to say to you that the fists
of this machine could ignite.

179
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:44,372
Even a monstre marin would be made cramer!

180
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:09,838
It was right a heating!

181
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:12,637
This time it left!

182
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:15,638
Admire Noro Noro Coach Training!

183
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:28,505
I see! It is like that the other
man-fish deviated the rays.

184
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:32,572
Fact of shitting… if I could approach me…

185
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:39,105
Always try to avoid it,
you will nevertheless finish flaring or crushed!

186
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:42,572
Yes!

187
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:50,238
I NEVER HAD THINK HAS THAT!!

188
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,172
WHAT?!

189
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,572
Species of imbecile!

190
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:43,654
It is the final combat of
return match of Davy Back Fight…

191
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:46,787
and we do not have any idea of
what occurs inside.

192
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:50,055
But it is certain that a duel without pity proceeds there!

193
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:56,787
The spectators encourage our Oyabin!

194
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,254
It cannot lose.

195
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:01,587
Obviously! Luffy carries a Afro cut…

196
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:05,388
Even all alone, Luffy can finish some with this asshole.

197
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:08,122
What does it have of so special, this Afro cut?

198
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:11,122
It returns it really more extremely?

199
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,922
That takes more time than usually.

200
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,854
It is because it is out of rubber.

201
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,388
It is out of rubber and with a Afro cut.

202
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:20,788
What does it have of so special this Afro cut?

203
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:25,654
Luffy will recover us, I am sure…

204
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:28,055
Cavity… It carries a Afro cut.

205
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,055
Even Robin…?

206
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:35,921
Oh! There is agitation on the bridge!

207
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,921
Where is the combat?

208
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:41,055
Is there already a winner?

209
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:44,188
I see two shades!

210
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,922
That of Oyabin is upright!

211
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:59,788
OYABIN!!

212
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:09,522
Straw hat on the other hand is burned with sharp.
It had to box serious punches.

213
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,588
Luffy!

214
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:14,722
Impossible…

215
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:16,921
How punches did can burn it?

216
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,122
What did it occur?

217
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:21,122
Luffy!

218
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:22,588
Look at…

219
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,788
Luffy with the Straw hat was raised!

220
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:38,055
Whereas everyone believed it K.O. !

221
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:47,188
You hold hardly upright, Straw hat.

222
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:54,321
Drunk Brother… A Afro truth…

223
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,188
Put it at the carpet, Oyabin!

224
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,721
Here my Noro Noro Beam Sword!

225
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:14,587
Now, you cannot any more
to move neither your arms nor your legs!

226
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,222
Thus try to see…

227
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,488
If you can it…

228
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:46,488
Thirty seconds…

229
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:54,487
This time it is finished…

230
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:56,155
Not, not yet!

231
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,155
Luffy!

232
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,555
Luffy with the straw hat is raised!

233
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,487
This type is incredible…

234
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:14,022
It is Afro! The capacity of Afro made it wild!

235
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:18,255
Which embarrassment…

236
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,588
Take that!

237
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:31,987
It is unjust! This ray should be prohibited!

238
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:32,855
Usopp…

239
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,455
This time…

240
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:54,122
It is tiring to strike like that, you know…

241
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,055
It is more one combat, it is torture!

242
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:03,922
Still?

243
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:06,922
Still…

244
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:12,388
Luffy!

245
00:21:18,455 --> 00:21:19,988
I…

246
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:23,988
will beat me…

247
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:27,255
for my companions…

248
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,522
UNTIL DEATH!!!

249
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,854
It is… It was still raised!

250
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,855
LUFFY WITH THE STRAW HAT!!

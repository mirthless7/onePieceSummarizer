1
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:21,440
The spirit of impostors!

2
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:21,440
The heart of the rebellious army, Kamyu!

3
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,990
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,730
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,700
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

6
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,720
Having left the green city of Erumalu, Luffy and its crew…

7
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,720
… move towards the oasis of Yuba, where the rebels are.

8
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,060
, They came across the pirates of sands, bound a new friendship, and recovered on the way.

9
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,580
Over there the village is which one calls Ido.

10
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,810
You will be able to find water there.

11
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,850
What?

12
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,460
You do not come with us?

13
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,740
We, the pirates of sands, will not go further.

14
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,420
Since generations, we lived, died, earned our living on this sand.

15
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,830
Did Ah ouais?

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,970
Ouais, the desert is a free ground.

17
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,730
However, there are those which cannot survive the difficult conditions of the desert.

18
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,420
The village is full people like that.

19
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,900
And now, that will you make?

20
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,550
One nothing will make!

21
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
Now and for always.

22
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,650
We will continue to live freely on this sea of sand.

23
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,480
It is like us!

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,940
Really? They is cool!

25
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,670
Hello, with the next one!

26
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,300
Hello, Umbrella-Ossan!

27
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,340
It was a sympathetic group…

28
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,220
With is the fact, by where your brother party?

29
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,820
I do not know.
But does not worry you for Ace.

30
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,750
It will be found early or late!

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,010
Really, you made the pair with your conneries!

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,520
Udon = Flat of Noodles Japanese

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,520
Finally in short, we dispatch outward journey at the village of Udon.

34
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,540
Ido.

35
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,720
Ido?

36
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,310
Ouais.

37
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,970
C-C' is the flag of the pirates of sands!

38
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,210
It is bad sign…

39
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,960
J I must warn Aniki!

40
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,960
Aniki appoints the Chief here, a brother (of weapon)

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,160
We are really honoured that the rebellious army remains in our village!

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,780
Since you arrived, Kamyu-Sama,

43
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,730
the attacks on the village ceased!

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,570
Ouais, whoever dares to defy us…

45
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,950
… must really be stupid.

46
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,980
Sonchou, let make us!

47
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,960
You are right completely!

48
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,510
But I heard that the hour of the confrontation enters the rebellious army and the royal army approaches.

49
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,010
Won't Ca pose problems to you to remain here?

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,820
One can eat all that one wants.
I would like to never leave from here.

51
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,320
Since it is like that.

52
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,710
Even if us are called “the rebellious army”,

53
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,830
we were not turned over yet against the King.

54
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,550
Yes, the inhabitants of this village also make confidence with the King completely.

55
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,620
We thought that we should treat the things as they come.

56
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,030
You do not worry about that.
We deal with all.

57
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,790
We did not think of anything else when we protected our village.

58
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,460
But exchanges some, do not forget to give us to drink and eat!

59
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,070
Yes! Of course, please, you do not worry that!

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,370
Good, eh well, excuse me,
now I leave you.

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,890
Kamyu-Aniki, if the army does rebel is turned over against the King, one will have to really join them?

62
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,620
You laugh!

63
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,620
This village will not be left as long as they will be useful for us.

64
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,590
Aniki! Problem!
There is a problem, Aniki!

65
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,390
What is there?
You cannot speak less extremely?!

66
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,800
We are eating here!

67
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,270
Pirates of sands!

68
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,010
The pirates of sands come by here!

69
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,520
You are sure? What do we have to make?

70
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,370
About what do speak you? It is impossible that one can fight against them!

71
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,690
And we cannot take our legs with our neck in front of the villagers either…

72
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,410
Does He, Aniki what one make?

73
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,910
Well, we will take our legs with our neck, foutre the camp from here.

74
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,420
You flee!?

75
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,540
But what will one make after being himself flee?

76
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,040
Will one take again our lives of famished?

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,150
Species of moron!

78
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,950
It is more important to remain in life!

79
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,720
There is full with other villages like that one to find!

80
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,640
Go, one goes there.

81
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,640
It rightly.

82
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,950
Who are to you you?

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,780
You have really courage to make you pass for the rebellious army with this attitude of coward.

84
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,080
Four strapping fellows as you will make a so small thing.

85
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,450
Who are you? Deal with your business!

86
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,420
When did you arrive here?

87
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,600
Robber of food!

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,770
Another, please!

89
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes!!

90
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
Please, excuse to us our impertinence.

91
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,320
Food is good, here.

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,660
Yes! Thank you, Mister!

93
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
I ask you to forgive us!

94
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,530
I know now that you are not somebody usually!

95
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,830
How you can see it, we do not make the weight against the pirates of sands!

96
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,010
We need you to fight them!

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,280
Please, lend to us your force!

98
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,860
Eh well I think that I can help you…

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,560
With a condition.

100
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
Of course, which?

101
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,300
He!

102
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,170
He!

103
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,950
Ace!

104
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,670
It is there.

105
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,810
What is it that this trick?

106
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,990
Well, well. They said that the pirates of sands arrived, but they are only you, the guy.

107
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,770
Hein? About what you do speak?

108
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,540
If you sought the pirates of sands, they left there does not have a long time.

109
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,170
Oh. It is true?

110
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,160
It does not matter.

111
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,350
At all events, Luffy be useful yourself!

112
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,680
I brought back for you a supply of water and food!

113
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,530
He, thank you very much!

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,550
It would be said that one will not have any more problems of food before one moment.

115
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,460
You are fantastic, Ace.

116
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,530
It is to it him at least!
Not as a little brother whom one knows.

117
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,740
Ca goes, I included/understood.

118
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,130
I have the very dry mouth.

119
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,040
Oh, wood then!

120
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,390
Me too!

121
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,540
Um… Ace-San?

122
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,840
I did not think that you had enough money to pay you all that…

123
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,180
Please, do not say to me that you stole all that to this village…

124
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,480
Of course that not, I had all that on behalf of the rebellious army.

125
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,280
Does the army rebel!?

126
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,800
Even if that appeared obvious that they did not form part of it.

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,720
What do you want to say by “did not form part of it”?

128
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,520
I say that they are made pass for soldiers of the rebellious army, and play the part of bodyguards for this village.

129
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,300
The villagers were so grateful, that they did not think of it of twice.

130
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,260
They are simply wandering brigands.

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,580
But why be bodyguards?

132
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,670
Won't they be uncovered?

133
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,090
It would seem that the robbers, by hearing the name “armed rebel”, flee at once without fighting.

134
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,870
It is rather practical, since the villagers are enthusiastic to offer food and glory to them.

135
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,970
The rebellious army is not a band of brigands, or a decorative symbol which one exposes…

136
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,160
Vivi-Chan, do we have to show with these types some tricks?

137
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,920
Well, by using the villagers like preys,

138
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,120
these robbers and this false army rebels are not quite different.

139
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,330
But the village saw in peace since they are there.

140
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,060
You want to always do something?

141
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,430
But Ace, tries to include/understand what Vivi-Chan feels.

142
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,700
Wouldn't you want of the tabasser?

143
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,510
, Made well what you want.

144
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,260
I said right what I thought.

145
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,340
I do not want to hear your excuses!

146
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,460
Right in the middle of the desert, I waited, only!

147
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,590
You do not need to take party for these merdeux.

148
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,920
I do not take party.

149
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,560
I thought that it was simplest considering you are in a hurry.

150
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,510
The country is not in state currently to have the eye on each village.

151
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,960
The best thing to be made for each village is to maintain peace by their own means.

152
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,330
Then…

153
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,190
Not, I want to test them initially.

154
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,530
To test?

155
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,250
Yes.

156
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,370
If these false rebels feel responsible for the protection of the village,

157
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,470
then I do not think only the name that they are given is important.

158
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,370
Thus you want to test their heart?

159
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,170
Yes.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
I do not like to ask you that,

161
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,490
but there is something which I would like that you make.

162
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,660
All the pleasure is for me, Vivi-Chan!

163
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,890
Yosha!

164
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,810
Ca will become interesting!

165
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,560
Will Ca be funny?

166
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,690
Wait, Luffy!

167
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,290
We there will not play, included/understood?

168
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,940
I know!

169
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,310
All that one must do, it is to beat isn't these false rebels?

170
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,320
Cretin! Listen to it initially.

171
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,280
He takes his time well…

172
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,970
He said that he occupied himself some, but that made already two hours!

173
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,430
With its force, it is certainly lathing the pirates of sands.

174
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,990
Yes but vis-a-vis them, it is perhaps being made lath.

175
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,350
If it were the case, would we be the next ones?

176
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,440
I can about it more!

177
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,940
Even if it is damage to leave such a place…

178
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,490
it is more important to remain in life!

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,000
It rightly.

180
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,880
Kamyu! One counts on you!

181
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,920
Will do them to you!

182
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,350
For Kamyu, hurrah!

183
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,550
Kamyu-Sama!

184
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,050
Kamyu, banzaï!

185
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,680
Will do them to you!

186
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,650
One counts on you!

187
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,820
Kamyu-Sama!

188
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,470
Kamyu-Sama, one put on you!

189
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,120
Frankly, we were going to call you, but…

190
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,640
we did not expect any less, Kamyu-Sama!

191
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,930
It seems that you knew already that the pirates are there.

192
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,680
Pirates!?

193
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,200
They is not the pirates of sands!?

194
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,720
Yes, they are pirate truths.

195
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,760
And they are much wilder than the pirates of sands!

196
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,190
And this blow, they are special!

197
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,490
The premium on them is of 30.000.000!

198
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,930
Everyone is so excited by learning that you will put them of pieces!

199
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,360
We expect an exquisite spectacle!

200
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,160
Give all that you have!

201
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,950
Them will make you, Onii-Chan!

202
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,980
Do not lose against these pirates, hein?

203
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,470
I will be as strong as you, Onii-Chan!

204
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,830
We leave!

205
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,000
Are A-Aniki, serious for you?

206
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,900
Pinhead, it is impossible that Aniki is serious!

207
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,470
Close it.

208
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,980
Once apart from the village, we will run in the direction opposed to the pirates.

209
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,780
It does not have there an other possibility if we want to remain in life, isn't this?

210
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,630
It rightly!

211
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,400
Shit!

212
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,020
They follow us!

213
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,340
These people are so carefree…

214
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,490
Listen maintaining me.
We will have only a few seconds.

215
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,860
As soon as we know where the pirates are, we will run like nutcases on the other hand!

216
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:23,900
Included/understood?

217
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,700
We included/understood well.

218
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,670
It left!

219
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,350
One!

220
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,080
Two!

221
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,780
Three!

222
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,420
Shit…

223
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,670
Attack them, Rebels-Samas!

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,830
Ca is enough now, morons!

225
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,500
Who devil are you?
He said rebellious?

226
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,420
He! Sure B-Bien that not!

227
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,540
We were right of passage.

228
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,640
Listen, rot of pirates!

229
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,350
The army rebels here present goes you écrabouiller in sand!

230
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
You would make better prepare you!

231
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,450
Can these idiots remain apart from that!?

232
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,060
Forgive me for my insolence.

233
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,890
Please, continue, Kamyu-Sama!

234
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,230
Whatever the vision which one has of them, they seem to be a band of cowards.

235
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,110
They do not have the air highly reliable.

236
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,160
Yes…

237
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,750
You are sure?

238
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,180
It would be better for the village if they removed rust from them immediately.

239
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,010
Good luck!

240
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,620
Still a little… Let us wait still a little.

241
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,520
Do not lose!

242
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,440
Go ahead, Kamyu-Sama!

243
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,850
Kamyu-Sama!

244
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,860
Will do them to you!

245
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,050
He!

246
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,230
Thus you are rebels!

247
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,900
C- It is not what you believe…

248
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,360
Q-Q-that do make we, Aniki?

249
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,070
There is no chance to escape.

250
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,250
He, the guy!

251
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,480
Ace-Sama…?

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,970
Please, save us…

253
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,440
It is your combat.

254
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,470
Try to arrive there by yourselves.

255
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,560
But it is impossible, we are impostors…

256
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,500
If you are a man, launches out!

257
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,530
For how long still will you act as cowards?

258
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,890
What do we have to make, Aniki?

259
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,000
Does what one have to make?

260
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,690
We owe bluffer as impostors who we are.

261
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
As impostors who we are?

262
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,940
Species of fucked up the ass, guess what!

263
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,080
We are not the only rebels here!

264
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,310
Here in this village…

265
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,070
… 100.000 of our companions are!!

266
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,930
He, He. Even a child would have found a better lie.

267
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,340
You can speak.

268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,920
WHAT!? 100.000!?

269
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,130
Who could believe that!?

270
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,120
It is obvious that it bluffe!

271
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,590
What!? It is a lie!?

272
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,250
Of course!

273
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh, it was only one lie…

274
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,420
He!

275
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,000
He you!

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,130
How you dared to trap me?!

277
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,590
Shit, they did not believe there!

278
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,940
You thought seriously that they went gober that?

279
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,340
What was it that!?

280
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,300
It is the capacity of a fruit of the demon!

281
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,760
It was made carry!

282
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,770
Even the rebellious army does not make the weight vis-a-vis that!

283
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,040
Luffy, dreadful idiot, if you beat them, it is the end!

284
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,780
What do you have at the head?

285
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,030
Kamyu-Oniichan!

286
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,760
Do not give up!

287
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,540
The pirate arrives!

288
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,950
Continue to test!

289
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,530
Onii-Chan!!

290
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,870
It is true.

291
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,030
When I was small, I admired the warriors of Arabasta.

292
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,780
I always wanted to be as strong as them one day.

293
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,130
Not… I am always the same one.

294
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,860
I want to always be as these powerful warriors whom I saw, child.

295
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,450
One day…

296
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,140
For how long still will you act as cowards?

297
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,610
Aniki!

298
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,990
We are perhaps a band of impostors,

299
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,470
but I want to become as strong as the heroes as I saw this day.

300
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,680
I am only one hooligan today…

301
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,830
But…

302
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,320
Even if my dream cannot become reality,

303
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,330
I cannot remove the dreams of these children over there.

304
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,080
Even if I cannot beat to you now, these children do it one day!

305
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,850
And in their interest, I will fight!

306
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,290
If one remembers ego like useless hooligan,

307
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,270
I prefer to become a hero now and to die!

308
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,310
Aniki!

309
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,870
This dumb…

310
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,050
You think of being with the height?

311
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,680
I will fight too!

312
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,700
The dream of Aniki is my dream!

313
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,260
It is sure, I made only unimportant things since I am small.

314
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,830
But Aniki always defended the weak ones!

315
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,210
I I will follow you, Aniki!
Where that you go!

316
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,070
I will be a hero with Aniki!

317
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,110
This guy…

318
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,940
He rightly, even if that is not used for nothing, I will fight.

319
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,760
I will show you the power of my will!

320
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,810
It is true!

321
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,440
We could not flee even if we want it!

322
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,410
The guy…

323
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,480
The atmosphere changed, it seems to me.

324
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,830
Although it seems more than they are desperate after being made drive back.

325
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,590
Yes.

326
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,760
But if you do not have anything invaluable at the bottom of your heart,

327
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,700
you will be unable to change like that.

328
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,470
Therefore, they make the deal?

329
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,360
Yes, allons-y.

330
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,890
I leave this task between their hands for the moment.

331
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
He, we will beat a retreat! Reprocess.

332
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,580
Pirates, who that you are! You bring!

333
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,900
I will not let any among you pose a foot in the village!

334
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,640
It is the spirit!

335
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,310
Now, I am of mood to going to explode Crocodile!

336
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,630
Ca made of the good, that made of the good!

337
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,200
Stop jacasser and allons-y!

338
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,350
Imbeciles! Be cursed, armed rebel!

339
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,220
I never saw of all my life of the rebels who appeared also strong!

340
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,950
I… am not able to say it…

341
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,800
Await me!

342
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,650
That… What doesn't go on their premises?

343
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,580
Kamyu-Sama!

344
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,900
You ace be brilliant!

345
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,270
Cheer!

346
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,980
Really impressive, Rebel-Sama!

347
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,430
You succeeded!

348
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Thank you!

349
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,840
You succeeded!

350
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,490
Yo, Luffy!

351
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,240
Oh, Ace!

352
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,030
You intend to run for how long still?

353
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,220
Is the number finished, not true?

354
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,380
You know, people who throw their life as that is alarming!

355
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,550
I see.

356
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,990
Protect it until death! The Sandy ones!

357
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,600
So long, Vivi.

358
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,650
Become a large Princess!

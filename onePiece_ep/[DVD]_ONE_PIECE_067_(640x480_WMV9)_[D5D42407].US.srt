1
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:17,430
To deliver princess Vivi!

2
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:17,430
Pirates of Luffy on the departure

3
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,770
Bandage the bastard ones!

4
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,710
It was which them?

5
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,190
It is…

6
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,870
What a force!

7
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,820
Incredible.

8
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,980
Now,

9
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,540
our combat is continued!

10
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,380
Yes!

11
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,230
Stop!!

12
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,660
I do not believe in it!

13
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,220
What you made, brothel?

14
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,400
You have chance that the girl is unscathed!

15
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,260
You know that you failed to cost me 1 billion Berrys?

16
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,900
You include/understand?

17
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,110
You there…

18
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,080
About what do speak you?

19
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,310
Why did you save me?

20
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,070
Ah yes.
We must speak about it.

21
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,410
What would you say to negotiate a contract with me?

22
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,110
A contract?

23
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,840
Stop beating you!

24
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,630
Crowned Zoro!

25
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,240
Why you did not say it to me?

26
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,030
I believed that you had become insane and that you all had killed them

27
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,670
just because they had not made you your favorite dish!

28
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,300
Is species of cretin, it what you would have done?

29
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,190
Eh well, does not worry you any more for that!

30
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,340
You two, the farm!

31
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,790
Therefore, here is our offer.

32
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,710
We want 1 billion Berrys to escort you in full safety over there.

33
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,900
You how these guys are strong, isn't this saw?

34
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,120
It is a good deal, you do not believe?

35
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Impossible.

36
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,990
You have my gratitude to have saved me the life.

37
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,510
Thank you!

38
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,170
Why not?

39
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,390
Is not this is to you a Princess?

40
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,060
It is right a small billion…

41
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,380
You know the country named Arabasta?

42
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,730
Not.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,660
It was a large pillar of civilization.

44
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,000
A ground of peace.

45
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,500
It was a long time ago.

46
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,390
A long time?

47
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,550
And now?

48
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
A civil war is preparing.

49
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,660
These last years, a call to the revolution was launched.

50
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,180
Citizens began from the acts of insurrection

51
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,060
involving the country towards chaos.

52
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,750
But one day, I heard the name of a secret organization:

53
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,700
Works baroque!

54
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,640
I discovered that they were responsible for the incentive to the rebellion.

55
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,940
Moreover, beside that,

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,700
I could not get any information to me.

57
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,600
Then, I spoke in Igaram, which deals with me since my childhood.

58
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,230
The old man with the hair chikuwa?

59
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,220
Chikuwa = Kind of fish roller

60
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,400
Chiku? yes, it is him.

61
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,750
I decided to infiltrate Baroque Works.

62
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,280
I thought that by doing it, I would learn some more on

63
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,510
those which draw the strings and which were their plans.

64
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,780
You ace of the testicles for a Princess.

65
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,230
And? you discovered their intentions?

66
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,900
The assertion of an ideal nation.

67
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,380
Igaram-San already said it to me.

68
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
It could be…

69
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,520
Yes.

70
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,010
They tell that a “ideal Nation” is their goal.

71
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,500
But it is a lie.

72
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,110
Their real intention is to go up on the throne of Arabasta!

73
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,340
I must turn over in my country to say the truth to the people,

74
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,950
and to prevent them from joining the rebellion!

75
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,390
If that continues…

76
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,290
If that continues…

77
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,340
I include/understand.

78
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,540
Then here what occurs.

79
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,000
All has a direction finally.

80
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,760
If a civil war is close,

81
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,860
the money must be rare.

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,410
Then which is the thinking head?

83
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,750
True identity of the Boss?

84
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,560
Do not ask it to me!

85
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,930
But you know it, not?

86
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,970
Do not ask!
I cannot say it to you!

87
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,580
If I say it to you, they will track you too!

88
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,520
Indeed, that is not wanted.

89
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,030
And of course, to try to capture a whole nation…

90
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,960
Isn't Ca must be a super guy extremely?

91
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,110
Yes!

92
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,670
Whatever your force, it is not possible to believe that you will be able to touch it.

93
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,750
One of Shichibukai…

94
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,750
Shichibukai = one of the Captains Corsairs

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,360
Crocodile!

96
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,080
It is which?

97
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,000
You have just said it?

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,250
Is He, it what this otter and this vulture?

99
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,160
Afflicted! Afflicted! Afflicted! I am sorry!!!

100
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,690
One of Shichibukai will continue to us now!

101
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,220
She said “Shichibukai”!

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,060
Not badly!

103
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,170
What will arrive to us?

104
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,690
I am sorry!
Ca slipped out of my mouth!

105
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,990
To be sorry will not change anything for us maintaining!

106
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,020
Now, you mingled us with all that!!

107
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,810
We arrive just on Grand Line and us here are tracked at died by Shichibukai…

108
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,340
Why me?

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,410
There is bowl, one will fight one of them soon.

110
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,460
Does I wonder what it resemble?

111
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,660
Your mouths you two!

112
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,520
Even if that were not long, very glad to have made your knowledge with all!

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Where you go?

114
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,270
They did not see me yet, therefore I release!

115
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,940
Hahaha! You are gifted!

116
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,590
Not! Now, I cannot even flee?

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,830
I am really sorry!

118
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,240
These guy are enough cools.

119
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,300
In any event, where would we be flee?

120
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,940
In any case, three among us were added with the list of died of Works Baroque.

121
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,520
It is if exciting!

122
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,830
I have economies… Approximately 500.000 Berrys…

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,770
You do not worry!

124
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,180
Do not fear…

125
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,940
Do not fear anything!
I have a plan!

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,880
Igaram!

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
It is for what to make this clothing?

128
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,960
Old man, you would mislead no matter whom while carrying that!

129
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,640
My God! I am surrounded cretins!

130
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,740
Vivi-Sama, listen to me attentively.

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,490
The information network of Works Baroque will receive soon this report/ratio.

132
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,380
Once they will know that we are those who know the true identity of the Boss,

133
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,850
you what will arrive, isn't this knows?

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,160
A thousand of hunters will be after us.

135
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,980
Therefore I got dressed like a Princess.

136
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,970
I will leave with these three factitious headstocks

137
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,720
and I will make course directly on Arabasta.

138
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,550
It is us that?

139
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,460
Lures.

140
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,230
Once they will have started to continue me,

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,660
Vivi-Sama and yourselves will be able to leave in full safety for Arabasta.

142
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,000
Wait one minute!

143
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,610
Who said that we would take along the Princess some share?

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,110
We still do not have a contract.

145
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,060
To take along the Princess?

146
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,380
What does that want to say?

147
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,140
You did not listen to them?

148
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,730
The old man wants that one brings back it to it.

149
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,840
Is Oh, it of that they speak?

150
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,740
Ok!

151
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,490
Crocodile will try to kill us!!

152
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,210
This Crocodile, it is really so strong that?

153
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,640
It is one of Shichibukai.

154
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,510
Therefore, as a pirate elected by the government,

155
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,950
it is not any more on their list of settings at price.

156
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,390
But before this decision, its head was worth 80 million Berrys.

157
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,120
80 Million?
They is four times the price of Arlong!

158
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,610
Stop it!

159
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,000
Will you accept?

160
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,440
Ouais!

161
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,390
Ca seems funny.

162
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,700
You have my deeper gratitude.

163
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,390
Well, now, me Vivi, I will leave…

164
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,610
The old man, you are like it!

165
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,670
Like which?

166
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,640
Now Princess, give me Eternal Pose.

167
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,420
Does Eternal Pose?

168
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,330
You never intended some to speak?

169
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,600
I will explain you:it is a version solidified for the eternity of the Log Poses.

170
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,600
The Log Poses guides you from one island to another,

171
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,570
But Eternal Pose never forgets the magnetic field of the island on which it was regulated.

172
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,640
It should eternally point towards this island.

173
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,180
And this one points on Arabasta.

174
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,570
With that you will arrive at Arabasta.

175
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,460
Vivi-Sama, after having marked some pauses,

176
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,220
you direct quickly towards Arabasta.

177
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,450
I never did it myself,

178
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,250
but I am certain that you can follow the Log two or three times to arrive there.

179
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,380
And now, I leave the Princess to your care.

180
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,170
Of course!

181
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,960
Igaram.

182
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,140
I think that the tour will be dangerous.

183
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,100
Please, made attention on the way.

184
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:55,660
Iga…

185
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,700
You too.

186
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,470
We should re-examine us on our premises.

187
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,230
The safety of our country is between your hands.

188
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,650
Well, it left.

189
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,380
It was a sympathetic old man, not?

190
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,480
Yes, we can count on him.

191
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,940
Impossible!

192
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,090
It is not possible!

193
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,770
They are already there?

194
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,250
It was a man well!!

195
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,010
Nami, the Log!

196
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,280
They is good! It is already regulated!

197
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,910
It catches!

198
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:20,930
Go to the boat!

199
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,230
Vivi! Vivi!

200
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,260
Quickly!

201
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,390
If they see us here, all that will have been used for nothing, not?

202
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,110
Ca will go!

203
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,460
One will bring back for you at home!

204
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,520
You see these guy?

205
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,370
They do not have the air like that of it…

206
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,010
Oi Luffy! Take the two others!

207
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,020
But they saved any East Blue!

208
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,590
I will seek the boat!

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,550
Just with them four!

210
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
Ok! I go there!

211
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,160
What does Baroque Works represent for them?

212
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,050
And Crocodile?

213
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,870
Shichibukai does not have any chance!

214
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,730
One goes there!

215
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,270
What you insane brothel, Luffy? He!

216
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,580
You will break me the nose!

217
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Release to me brothel!!

218
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,760
What you insane?

219
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,820
Hurry Vivi!

220
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,690
Karu is not there…

221
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,320
What a idiotic!

222
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,450
To make the lure.

223
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,860
He, I have them!

224
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,270
Go up, one is ready to leave!

225
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,330
Hein?

226
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,590
The guy you still sleep…

227
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,210
We do not have time to seek it for the moment!

228
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,250
But I cannot leave it all alone here!

229
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,130
But, you know…

230
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,940
He! What is there?

231
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,190
She says that its duck asshole is not there!

232
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,170
She said that it should have come when she whistled it but it did not come!

233
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,220
That one?

234
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,310
You were all this time there?

235
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,580
It was already on board when I arrived.

236
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,790
If we sail on the river, we will lead to the sea.

237
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,690
We will be able to get under way more quickly.

238
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,420
Allons-y!!

239
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
Mr. Bushido!

240
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,670
About how much hunters do speak we with the Juste?

241
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,450
I do not know!

242
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,230
Baroque Works has approximately 2000 employees.

243
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,140
And I intended to say that there are other cities like this one in the surroundings.

244
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,980
Good blood, 2000 people?

245
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,390
Does He… the boat move?

246
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,930
You are finally debouts?

247
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,400
Wait! Let us remain another night!

248
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,160
Yes!

249
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,450
One had fun so and the girls were so nice!!

250
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,690
When will we find a city also brilliant?

251
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,040
Slow down brothel!

252
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,750
We are to pir…

253
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,540
It is not even yet the morning!

254
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,700
They still do not know what occurs…

255
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,400
He! Explain to them…

256
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,510
Oh… It is done!

257
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,600
It was fast…

258
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,160
Yes, I jumped the tedious details!

259
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,980
We soon will leave the island.

260
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,130
Cool! Fog!

261
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,740
It will make soon day.

262
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,310
Eh well, it is a good thing to have escaped with your prosecutors!

263
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,560
It is sure!

264
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,570
Made attention with the hollows not to burst the hull.

265
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,280
You can count on me!

266
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
Was Euh, it you Luffy?

267
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,960
Pretty boat.

268
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,420
Who it is?

269
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,810
You! You are…

270
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,360
I saw Mr. 8 it does not have there a long time,

271
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,240
Wednesday miss.

272
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,640
You killed Igaram!

273
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,560
Even if it is you,

274
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,960
what you insane on my boat?

275
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,080
Who are you?

276
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,440
What you made here?

277
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,120
Miss All Sunday!

278
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,550
Miss All Sunday?

279
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,830
It of which number is the partner this time?

280
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,700
That of Mr. 0.

281
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,780
The partner of the Boss.

282
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,940
That of Crocodile?

283
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Then it is malicious?

284
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,470
It is only authorized to know the true identity of the Boss…

285
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,940
We followed it to know who it was really.

286
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,290
Or to be more precise,

287
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,390
I let to you follow me.

288
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,090
Oh, it is nice.

289
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,630
I knew it!

290
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,000
And thus, that which informed the Boss that its identity was uncovered,

291
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,050
it, isn't this was you?

292
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,370
Correct.

293
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,060
Then, it is malicious!

294
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
Remain apart from that.

295
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,550
Which are your intentions with the Juste?

296
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,850
Who knows?

297
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,170
But you were so serious in connection with that,

298
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,180
I just had to cooperate.

299
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,230
A Princess who thinks that it can become the enemy one of Works Baroque and save her country.

300
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,360
It is so ridiculous…

301
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,110
Close it!!

302
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,420
He, Sanji.

303
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,350
An idea what does without?

304
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,810
Not! Not exactly…

305
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,850
But it would be said that the adorable one
Miss Wednesday is in danger.

306
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,810
Could you not point these dangerous things on me?

307
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:14,750
Impossible!

308
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,820
Oh!

309
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,630
A Fruit…

310
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,110
A Fruit of the Demon?

311
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,030
What?

312
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,510
Which kind of capacity is this thus?

313
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,870
Ouah, seen from here, it is a splendid woman!

314
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,890
Really, do not be so in a hurry.

315
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,170
I do not have any order in this moment,
thus I do not have any reason to fight with you.

316
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,780
Then, you are thus famous Capitaine with the straw hat?

317
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,110
Monkey D. Luffy.

318
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,380
He! Return to me this hat!

319
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,360
You want to fight?

320
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,900
You are not the welcome here,
then releases from our boat, pétasse!

321
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,230
Which bad luck…

322
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,170
You them pirate collecting a Princess that Baroque Works wants dead.

323
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,800
And this Princess is protected by if small number of pirates…

324
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,400
But your greater bad luck

325
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,560
is the road towards which the Log carries out you Poses.

326
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,190
The name of the next island is…

327
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,440
Little Garden.

328
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,150
My expensive small,

329
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,430
you will not arrive whole at Arabasta even if we do not do anything.

330
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,850
You will be destroyed.

331
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,350
I of insane!
Return to me this hat!

332
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,210
Yes bouffonne!!!!!

333
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,280
Be to you a kid or what?

334
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,100
To move so quickly towards its tomb,

335
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,500
doesn't that seem to you so horrible, band the insane ones?

336
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,320
Eternal Poses…

337
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,160
With this, you can avoid Little Garden.

338
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,040
This needle indicates Nanimonaishi very close to Arabasta.

339
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,890
As none of our members knows this road,

340
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,210
you will not be followed.

341
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,610
What?

342
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,600
It helps us?

343
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,030
Why do you do that?

344
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,780
It is obviously a trap.

345
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,460
I wonder.

346
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,620
What do I make?

347
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,640
I do not want to accept something of this kind of it…

348
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,680
But, if I must sail on this boat,

349
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,680
then to take the surest road would be best.

350
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,750
It is what still this trap?

351
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,390
Cretin!

352
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,430
Es you completely idiot?

353
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,750
It has just said to us that it was the best way!!

354
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,580
And if it tried to help us? Then what?

355
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,370
You do not decide a road of the boat!

356
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,190
Oh, as they is unhappy.

357
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
It exploded the old man chikuwa,
I hate it!

358
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,510
Eh well, I do not hate those which have a great mind.

359
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,040
If you survive,

360
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,440
we will be re-examined.

361
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,110
Not!

362
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,930
One goes there Banchi!

363
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,510
What is it that?

364
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,170
It is still a monstre marin?

365
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,690
Not, it is…

366
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,450
It is a tortoise!!

367
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,360
It is an enormous tortoise!

368
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,990
This woman…

369
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,520
I do not include/understand what she wants to do!

370
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,640
To try to include/understand is a waste of time.

371
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,080
Yes, we have already people like that on board.

372
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,220
He! Can somebody explain me all that?

373
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,680
I do not know what occurs!

374
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,950
Oh Miss Wednesday, you belonged to the crew now?

375
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,510
He! Does somebody explain me?

376
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,600
We have an ostrich now?

377
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,200
He… What does it occur?

378
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,220
Would you like to eat something?

379
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,390
That somebody explains me all that!!

380
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,780
I see.

381
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,370
I did something of inexcusable but I must always show my capacities.

382
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,280
Ca will go!

383
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,600
Your deadened knight awoke,

384
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,610
and I will make my duty to ensure your safety.

385
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,300
Whore… I am glad to have slept!

386
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,550
Are Nami-San, you jealous?

387
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,300
At all.

388
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,660
I wonder

389
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,970
if all will occur well for me on board your boat.

390
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,880
I do not want to be a ball.

391
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,410
What do you tell?

392
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,980
Thanks to you, we all are put at price.

393
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,990
If you did not want to be a ball, it did not have to be said initially to us.

394
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,650
I am sorry.

395
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,500
Hein, Luffy?

396
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,870
Oh, I am hungry!

397
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,300
I do not believe that he is concerned with it…

398
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,400
In any case, we know our next stop.

399
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,640
Little Garden!

400
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,040
Is well there to be?

401
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,920
Who occupies himself some?

402
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,280
Allons-y, partners!

403
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,720
Yes!!

404
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,060
Yes.

405
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,370
We keep in mind…

406
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,230
Little Garden.

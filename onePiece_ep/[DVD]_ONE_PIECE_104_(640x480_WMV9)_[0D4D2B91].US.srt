1
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:36,070
Luffy against Vivi!

2
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:36,070
The desire for crying of the companions

3
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,340
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,010
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,230
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,650
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,450
In the hope to stop the rebellion, Princess Vivi goes to the oasis of Yuba.

8
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,660
But they discover that the rebellious army for a long time left the city.

9
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,230
During this time, the Agents Officers of Baroque Works remainders started to move.

10
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,580
It would seem that the final confrontation between the royal army and the army rebels became inevitable!

11
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Well, friends!

12
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,230
We had a hard day!

13
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,880
Let us take a little rest to take again forces for tomorrow.

14
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,940
Good night.

15
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,190
You slept all the time!

16
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,030
Moron…

17
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,520
Do not compare to me with you, you are monsters!

18
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,220
It is like that.

19
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,060
Moreover, today the price of laziness should return to you, Nose-Blue!

20
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,150
But I cannot support heat!

21
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,910
Sanji-San, it is my…

22
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,900
Yes, I thought that you would feel less only this night.

23
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,530
Do Eh, what you believe being making?

24
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,980
It would be said that somebody wants to die.

25
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,930
Which of you has just launched me that?

26
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,830
Do you include/understand the significance of the word “To sleep”?

27
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,490
You died!

28
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,740
Take that!

29
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,500
Why you attack me me!?

30
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,010
Eh, Ossan…
There is no water which leaves.

31
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,700
My throat is very dry.

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,630
It is rather hard to live outside like that.

33
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,380
Water will come.

34
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,010
The oasis of Yuba is always in life.

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,500
Yuba will never be overcome by a little sand.

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,840
I will continue to dig, it does not matter the number of times that I must start again.

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,510
It is the invaluable ground which the King entrusted to me.

38
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,160
Hein?

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,360
Well of agreement! I will dig too!

40
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,150
Eh, of the calm one!

41
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,720
Do not send sand in the hole where I dig!

42
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,350
Try you to stop the hole or what!?

43
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,140
Not, I dig the hole.

44
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,300
It is not what I want to say! You send all sand in my hole.

45
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,190
Whereas I was the first to start to dig a hole, you see?

46
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,490
Ah.

47
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,360
Oh, then it is a magic hole!

48
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,410
But at all!

49
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,620
But I think of it… That makes a small moment that I did not receive from sand.

50
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,570
How did it can dig such a large hole also quickly?

51
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,510
It must be tired by its long voyage.

52
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,890
You rest this night well.

53
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,350
Meat…

54
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,400
Good night.

55
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,110
STOP JOKING!

56
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,910
How long it still will make us wait!?

57
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,700
Give me Poulpa.

58
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,480
I will dance.

59
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,500
I will do it, you know!

60
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,220
I am a swan!

61
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,830
A swan!

62
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,980
I will turn!

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,850
Mr. 2, please, remain calm.

64
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,290
Ouais, really. Imbecile!

65
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,030
Your cries hurt me with the hips!

66
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,290
You also, Miss Merry Christmas.

67
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,690
It would seem that you do not like to wait.

68
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,030
Well, it does not matter in fact.

69
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,900
Miss All Sunday.

70
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,720
Thank you to have made all this way to come.

71
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,820
I am content that you could all come.

72
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,340
In the city where people dream to become rich while gaining with the plays.

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,780
The city of the dreams, Rainbase.

74
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,670
And it is in the largest casino of the city, Rain Dinners, that I wish you the welcome.

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,280
Let us pass the formalities and go directly to essence, Miss All Sunday.

76
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,400
As you want.
I will continue the briefing.

77
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,350
Ouais, go ahead.

78
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,310
Start immediately!

79
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,690
Start now!

80
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,250
Continue now!

81
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,530
HOY! HOY! HOY! HOY! HOY!

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,700
But front, I must present to you…

83
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,250
… the Boss of our organization, that of which you never saw the face.

84
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,720
Until now, I acted like his representative…

85
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,940
… and I transmitted his orders to you.

86
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,620
But it will not be soon necessary any more.

87
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,090
You, isn't this includes/understands?

88
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,530
In other words, the moment came…

89
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,630
… for the Utopia Operation.

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,110
Crocodile…

91
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,360
The final objective of Works Baroque.

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,800
As envisaged, you seem to know it.

93
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,260
Its face all at least.

94
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,080
Of course that we know it!

95
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,950
But what does Shichibukai make here?

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,830
This guy is rather a large size!

97
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,810
Does that mean that we worked for a pirate all this time!?

98
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,200
Thus it is you the Boss?

99
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,830
Objections?

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,170
I do not have an objection, but…

101
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,910
Shichibukai is a pirate who has the permission of the government and which can plunder what he wants.

102
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,420
Why did you need to create this organization?

103
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,750
What I want, it is not money…

104
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,530
… or a social status.

105
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,280
It is a military capacity.

106
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
A military capacity?

107
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Let us discuss each thing one by one.

108
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,260
In first my objectives, then details of the Final Operation of Works Baroque…

109
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,330
Does such a thing really exist in this country?

110
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,880
Or do you hope to seize all the country?

111
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,500
I am so excited!

112
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,050
Approximately, our last orders…

113
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,400
… are to carry out the various facets of the final plan?

114
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,050
It is exact.

115
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,420
Each action that you carried out since the creation of the organization was part of this plan.

116
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,820
And these are the last orders that I will give you.

117
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,740
Time came for the kingdom from Arabasta to disappear.

118
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,300
Once you will have supplemented your last tasks,

119
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,870
the kingdom of Arabasta will crumble itself.

120
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,590
The rebellious army and people, plugged by the rage…

121
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,940
… will fall tragically into the hands from Works Baroque.

122
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,140
In only one night, this country will become our Utopia.

123
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,480
It is most important and the final plan of Works Baroque:Utopia operation.

124
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,310
The failure is unacceptable.

125
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,730
We will start tomorrow at 7 a.m.

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,780
OK!                     OK!

127
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,650
Let us request to be lucky.

128
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,740
I ask that the Utopia Operation be deferred.

129
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,590
Mr. 3, how did you find this base secret?

130
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,520
Mr. 3! Under which stone you had thus taken refuge!?

131
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,880
I conform to the orders, I thus will kill you!

132
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,140
Wait, Mr. 2.

133
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,200
“To be dissimulated”? As you are désobligeant.

134
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,430
I simply took the shuttle on the way since Spiders Café.

135
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,910
With the back of the body of Banchi, obviously.

136
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,000
Enchanted, Boss.

137
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,050
I came to ask for a second chance.

138
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:28,290
As I did not achieve the orders,
you, Mr. 2, of course received the order to eliminate me.

139
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,930
For this reason, I modified a little bit my way and I went to the point of appointment of the Agents:Spiders Coffee.

140
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,650
You did not achieve the orders?

141
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,520
About what do speak you?

142
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,350
I speak owing to the fact that I left Straw hat and Princess Vivi to escape…

143
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,000
You let them leave!?

144
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,850
Summers you saying to me that they are always alive?

145
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,520
Den Den Mushi = Snail Phon

146
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,520
What do you have says me to Den Den Mushi?

147
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,440
Hadn't you said me that you had dealt with each one of them, Princesse included/understood?

148
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,090
Den Den Mushi?

149
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,850
About what do speak you?

150
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,360
I am sure not to be to me served as my Den Den Mushi when I was in Little Garden…

151
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,640
How!?

152
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,310
Hey, thank you for your call.
It is the Restaurant of Shit.

153
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,410
Which is your order?

154
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,020
That could pose problem.

155
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,250
Now I know why Unluckies did not return yet from the island.

156
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,150
Well? You at least one or two out of them, isn't this killed?

157
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,490
Eh well, you see…

158
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,340
There was an error in information!

159
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,280
There were in fact 4 pirates with it!

160
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,630
A nose… There was one with a long nose of them…

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,020
Dumb…

162
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,890
Zéro-Chan! Can you explain us what it speaks!?

163
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,880
I do not include/understand anything the whole!

164
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,270
I…

165
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,100
I met these guy!

166
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,800
On my way, I met them!

167
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,540
How?

168
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,390
This guy!

169
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,900
And that one!

170
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,360
And it!

171
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,940
And him!

172
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
And he also, isn't this?

173
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,280
Moreover, it was Miss Wednesday and Princess Vivi!?

174
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,920
And you me known as that these guy are my enemies!?

175
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,540
Yes, they know my identity.

176
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,350
If I do not pay attention, they will interfere with my plan.

177
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:47,980
And as Mr. 3 has just said it, there was another person with them. As well as an animal.

178
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,900
If the animal is forgotten, they form a group of 5.

179
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,500
We can suppose that they already arrived at Arabasta.

180
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,600
Mr. 2, take some photographs by taking again their faces.

181
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,540
M- But, Boss!

182
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,130
I will exterminate Vivi as well as the group of the pirates if you give me…

183
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,150
Silence, you are really only one good with nothing!

184
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,350
Mr. 3…

185
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,230
Mr. 3!

186
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,750
Do you know why I gave you this title!?

187
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,830
In capacities of combat, you are lower than Mr. 4.

188
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,640
Mr. 3!

189
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:33,280
I believed that you had tenacity necessary to carry out the orders by employing the most underhand methods!

190
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,660
And I am very disappointed.

191
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,300
What is it!?

192
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,910
He is desiccating itself!

193
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,870
Water…

194
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,110
Water!

195
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,100
Wood all the water which you wish.

196
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,270
It is the hour of the meal.

197
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,640
Which is this place?

198
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,960
Am I under water?

199
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,120
Ca resembles an aquarium…

200
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,790
Bananawani!

201
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,790
Bananawani = Bananacroco

202
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,890
This moron had what it deserves.

203
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,280
Even its death is not enough for me!

204
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,550
Listen to me, the pawns.

205
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,270
Engrave these 5 faces in your brains.

206
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,520
Their goal is to stop the rebellious army.

207
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,030
If they are not continued, it will show themselves.

208
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,180
But, Zéro-Chan…

209
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,940
Even if it is the princess, it can still stop the rebellious army?

210
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,970
They would be annoying.

211
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,100
The leader of the rebellious army, Kohza and the Princess Nefertari Vivi…

212
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,660
… are amis d'enfance, according to our sources.

213
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,260
It is a movement of 700.000 people.
Even if it cannot stop them,

214
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,450
she can certainly make them hesitate.

215
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,460
I already set up several Billions in the rows of the rebellious army.

216
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,720
I do not have for the moment received any news of their share,

217
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,790
what means that they did not have to act up to now.

218
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,900
We cannot let Vivi come into contact with the rebellious army.

219
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,650
Miss All Sunday.

220
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,390
Yes.

221
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,720
Considering the circumstances, you are authorized to use Den Den Mushi if need be.

222
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:46,180
Order with the Billions in place to eliminate these five people if they meet them.

223
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,630
Let neither the Vivi nor pirates enter Katorea!

224
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,430
Vivi and Kohza should not meet!

225
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,800
Yes, I go there.

226
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,120
You all can leave.

227
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,470
You will be late for the festival.

228
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,620
Our Utopia is held in front of our eyes.

229
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,840
I trust you so that there are not other problems.

230
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,390
Let make us, Boss.

231
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,310
Yes, let make us!

232
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,170
Have fun.

233
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,930
I am afflicted, Vivi-Chan. You do not should have seen that.

234
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,580
Not, at all!

235
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,710
We will leave now, Ojisan.

236
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,990
Ah, Luffy-Kun. Hold, takes that with you.

237
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,480
Wow! Water!

238
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,910
Water!

239
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,670
It left the ground?

240
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,210
Just after you would have fallen asleep by digging last night.

241
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,490
We reached the level of water.

242
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,170
I drew a little water and I distilled it.

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,280
Ca seems a little complicated, but thank you!

244
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,020
The genuine water of Yuba.

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,800
Afflicted, but it is all that I can give you.

246
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,260
I will drink it by paying to!

247
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,790
Do Eh Luffy, what you make!?

248
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,580
Luffy?

249
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,870
What doesn't go, Luffy-San?

250
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,740
I give up.

251
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,930
To give up?

252
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,360
Do Luffy-San, what you want to say?

253
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,520
Go, Luffy. We do not have time to yield to your whims.

254
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,700
Rise!

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,630
One sets out again.

256
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,030
One must advance!

257
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,460
One must remake all the way towards Katorea and stop the rebellious army.

258
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,150
If a million people fight, it will be the end, you include/understand!?

259
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,450
It is for Vivi-Chan.

260
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,240
Go, come, one sets out again.

261
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,930
I don't care.

262
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,020
But what are you making!?

263
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:10,980
Vivi.

264
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,280
What?

265
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,880
I want to beat this refuse of Crocodile!

266
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,520
If we stop the rebellious army, that will stop Crocodile?

267
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,890
Even if we reach Katorea, there is not only we can make.

268
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,800
We are pirates.

269
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,980
You would make better go there without us.

270
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,000
Sometimes, this idiot without brain uses his head.

271
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,330
Lu… ffy can surprise us sometimes.

272
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,100
It… It is not…

273
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,420
All that you want, it is that nobody dies in this combat.

274
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,140
No inhabitant of this country.

275
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,790
None among us.

276
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,730
You speak about Shichibukai and a million people who are ready to fight.

277
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,250
And what you want, it is that nobody is wounded.

278
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,170
Is it a joke?

279
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,470
Await Luffy, cannot you try to include/understand the feelings of Vivi?

280
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,740
Nami-San, wait…

281
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,760
But…

282
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,830
What bell for you?

283
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,570
Which evil is there to want that nobody dies?

284
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,440
People die.

285
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,210
Stop speaking like that!

286
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,890
I will not let myself say that one second time!

287
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,650
It is exactly what we try to avoid!

288
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,100
The army of the rebels, the royal army…

289
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,750
Inhabitants of this country…
It is not their fault!

290
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,040
Then why should somebody die?

291
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,330
All that it is the fault of Crocodile!

292
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,120
Then why would you you risk your life?

293
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,770
He Luffy, you go too far!

294
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,800
Dumb, Luffy!

295
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,440
When you look at this country, what you see the urgent one to regulate…

296
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,030
Take that!

297
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,160
It is however clear… for me!

298
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,340
Yuba will never be overcome by a little sand.

299
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,000
You believe that to risk your own life, that will be enough!?

300
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,640
And then, what am I supposed to risk?

301
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,180
I will never forgive with this man!

302
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,080
What am I…?

303
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,510
I do not have anything else to bring into play…

304
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,820
Nothing…

305
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,940
Try to risk our lives at the same time as holds it!

306
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,030
We are your companions!

307
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,450
We are your companions!

308
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,700
What? One would say…

309
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,740
… that you cry.

310
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,060
I will stop the rebellion.

311
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,340
You are that which suffers more, and you want to fight it more than whoever.

312
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,780
Now say to me.

313
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,250
Where is Crocodile?!

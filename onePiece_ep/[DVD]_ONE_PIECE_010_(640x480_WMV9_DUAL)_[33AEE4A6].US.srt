1
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,068
What's that?

2
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,206
Yahoo!

3
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:03,084
Are you ok?

4
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:04,720
I am fine!

5
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:08,424
They all come here to see
what I have achieved.

6
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:11,123
The new members of
Usopp's pirate crew.

7
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:13,996
We are not.

8
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,631
I need you to do me a favor.

9
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:17,299
A favor? Me?

10
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,034
Yes! We need a big ship...
- Hey you!

11
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,971
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,376
Klahadore.

13
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:32,712
What is the meaning of this?

14
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:37,368
How can you break in like this?

15
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,316
Who are you?

19
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:10,519
Uh...
Pardon me, Klahadore...

20
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,260
These people are...
- Be quiet.

21
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:17,793
I will let you know later.

22
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,795
Please leave now.

23
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:22,531
Or do you have business here?

24
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:25,334
We want a ship.

25
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,176
I can't help you.

26
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,505
Usopp!

27
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:30,439
Damn!

28
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,108
We heard about you a lot.

29
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,568
You are quite famous here.

30
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,580
Really?

31
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,616
They said you had been
to different countries.

32
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,585
Very impressive for your age.

33
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:45,788
You can call me
"Captain Usopp".

34
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,023
That's my nickname.

35
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:50,449
Captain.

36
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:53,896
I heard about your father too.

37
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:55,526
What?

38
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,600
Klahadore, stop it.

39
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:01,529
You are nothing more than
a filthy pirate's son.

40
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:04,807
So I am not surprised
of whatever you do.

41
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:09,508
But you stay away from
Mistress Kaya!

42
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:12,715
How dare you say I am low...

43
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:16,485
You and Kaya live in
completely different worlds.

44
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:18,854
Are you here for money?
How much do you want?

45
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,689
You've gone too far, Klahadore!

46
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,992
Apologize to Usopp now!

47
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,793
Watch out, Kaya.

48
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:29,722
I am not going to apologize
to this savage, lady.

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,958
I am just telling the truth.

50
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:35,804
I am sorry for you, Usopp.

51
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,306
You must hate his guts.

52
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:39,508
You must hate you irresponsible
and selfish father --

53
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,778
-- who values money
more than you!

54
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,080
Klahadore!

55
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,253
Stop saying bad things
about my father!

56
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,645
Usopp!

57
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:02,031
Why are you so worked up?

58
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:05,568
Why not tell me some lies
about your father?

59
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,604
Like your father is a merchant...

60
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:11,473
...or that he's not your
real father, perhaps.

61
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:13,273
Shut up!

62
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:24,177
Captain!

63
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:26,889
Look at him.

64
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,557
His first instinct is violence.

65
00:05:28,558 --> 00:05:31,226
He's merely an animal.
Like father, like son.

66
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:32,889
Shut up!

67
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:36,932
I'm proud that my
father as a pirate!

68
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:40,569
I am proud of his
courage on the sea!

69
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,672
You are right.
I love to make stories.

70
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:48,877
But I am proud of
being a pirate's son!

71
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:51,254
I am a pirate's son!

72
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:57,191
Captain.

73
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:02,257
Your pirate is a
brave fighter on the sea?

74
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:05,388
That is a deceitful way
to tell the truth.

75
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,532
Your behavior is iron-clad
proof of your ruffian heritage.

76
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,968
Lie all you want...

77
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,870
...but when in trouble,
your first recourse
is violence.

78
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:18,607
The most damnable thing is
to get close to Kaya
only for money.

79
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,309
What did you say? I am...

80
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,678
I am on to your scheme!

81
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:26,315
You're trash!
Just like your pirate father!

82
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:27,683
That's enough!

83
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,367
Stop it, Usopp!

84
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,588
No more violence!

85
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:37,992
Klahadore isn't a bad guy.

86
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:44,430
He just concerned about me.
He didn't mean to do that.

87
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:51,407
Leave the grounds.

88
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,777
And don't ever come back!

89
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,579
You win.

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,471
You don't need to
tell me to leave.

91
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,697
I won't be coming back
ever again!

92
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,346
Usopp.

93
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,093
Damn, that man!

94
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:13,228
Captain isn't that kind of person!

95
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,863
Yeah, you idiot!

96
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,165
Idiot!

97
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,966
Idiot!!!

98
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,316
Why is it your concern?

99
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:26,542
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

100
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:28,535
Stupid jerk!

101
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:36,081
Get off this property at once!

102
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,863
It's meal time, my lady.

103
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,338
I don't want it.

104
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,229
I don't want to eat.

105
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,946
The chef will be upset
if he heard what you said.

106
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:11,885
He cooked really hard for you.
He made alot of healthy food for you.

107
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,923
Why did you say that?

108
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:22,290
Of course, I know I shouldn't
hide it from you.

109
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,601
I was wrong to talk to Usopp.

110
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:29,631
But you don't have
to make them leave.

111
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,268
May I sit down?
- Please.

112
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:47,284
It's going to be 3 years...

113
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:50,943
...since the first day
I got here.

114
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:55,072
I will never forget that day.

115
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:22,591
I got kicked off the ship
I worked on...

116
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:25,194
<i>...because I made a
tiny mistake.</i>

117
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:27,296
<i>No job and no money.</i>

118
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:30,499
<i>I almost died on the street.</i>

119
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,268
- Hey! Don't come near here!
- Get up!

120
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,534
This place isn't for
a person like you!

121
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,102
Sir? But...

122
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:54,521
I got it.
I'll let him in now.

123
00:09:56,025 --> 00:10:01,167
To me, your parents
were my saviors.

124
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:06,575
<i>You are my saviors' daughter.</i>

125
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:12,040
I know I don't have the right...

126
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,519
...to tell you who you can
make friends with.

127
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:18,180
But that young man Usopp...

128
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,416
...can't even do well greeting.
What can we expect from him?

129
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:26,021
If anything bad happens to you,

130
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:29,992
I'll have failed you
and your father!

131
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,961
I went too far.

132
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,963
Do you hate me?

133
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:37,266
I don't hate you.

134
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:39,968
I am grateful to you.

135
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:42,471
But please don't take this wrong.

136
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:45,207
Usopp is a good man.

137
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,945
It doesn't matter.
- Klahadore!

138
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,780
I really don't know
how to make you understand!

139
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,490
Right -- I don't.

140
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,219
Hey, where is Luffy?

141
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,236
I don't know.

142
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:17,072
He might have gone
to find the "Captain".

143
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:18,707
I know where the Captain went!

144
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,442
Yeah!
The beach!

145
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:23,971
He goes there often.

146
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,214
Wanna see?

147
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,383
No thanks.

148
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:31,887
Are you missing someone?

149
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,789
You mean Onion?

150
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,625
He disappears all the time.

151
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:39,708
Then he'll come back screaming.

152
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:43,732
We're doomed!

153
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:44,900
See?

154
00:11:44,901 --> 00:11:47,703
There is a man walking backwards!

155
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,149
There is a strange guy
walking backwards!

156
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,731
Liar!
- It's true!

157
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:55,735
Look!

158
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:06,906
Hey, who called me strange?

159
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,847
I am not strange.

160
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:15,030
You are strange.

161
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,298
Don't be silly.

162
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,034
I am just a travelling hypnotist.

163
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,636
Hypnotist? Cool!

164
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:23,605
Can you show us your trick?

165
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,440
Show us!

166
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:26,714
What?

167
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:29,511
Don't be silly.

168
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:34,044
Why should I show you my ability
to someone I don't know?

169
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:36,530
Ok. Look at the ring.

170
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:38,332
Why didn't he say so?

171
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:41,957
When I say
"One Two Django",
you will fall asleep.

172
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,490
Ready?

173
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:47,282
One... Two... Django!

174
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,065
Why are YOU sleeping too?

175
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,648
Hey!

176
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,987
Here you are!

177
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,476
What in the...
Can't you say "hi" normally?

178
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,320
What?
Anything happened?

179
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,642
Nothing.

180
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:30,405
That bastard!

181
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:32,607
He insulted my dad.

182
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:35,010
I hate that guy,too.

183
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,927
No matter what,
Yasopp is a great pirate.

184
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:39,653
Tell me!

185
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,652
He sticked to his dream
of becoming a pirate.

186
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:47,522
I'm really proud of my father.

187
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:51,193
That guy insulted my father
I am so proud of.

188
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:53,095
I will never forgive him.

189
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,874
You will never see that
lady again, will you?

190
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,168
I don't know.

191
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:04,172
If that butler comes and beg me,
MAYBE I'll see her.

192
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,875
THAT butler?
- Yes.

193
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,026
That butler.

194
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:11,076
That butler?
Why is he here now?

195
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:14,649
Hey, Django.

196
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,153
Didn't I tell you to
lay low in this village?

197
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:20,046
You were sleeping
on the street.

198
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:24,652
Don't be silly.
I'm not standing out.
And it's not strange at all.

199
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,130
There's a strange guy with him.

200
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,557
I haven't seen that man before.
Who is he?

201
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:35,203
So, is the plan all set?

202
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:36,777
Of course.

203
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:42,056
I'm ready anytime...

204
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,124
...to murder that
mansion's owner!

205
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:51,820
He said "murder"?

206
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:16,578
Don't use that term, Django.

207
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,203
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to.

208
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,719
Hey, what are they talking about?

209
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,001
Who knows.
I was gonna ask you.

210
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:31,826
I don't want to just kill Kaya.

211
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:35,764
We have to make it
look like an accident.

212
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,996
Got that?

213
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:42,070
We will wait for you signal
and attack the village.

214
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,639
And take her life, right?

215
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,009
Then you will inherit her money.

216
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,779
Stupid!
You are so stupid!

217
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,349
I can't inherit her money as
an outsider.

218
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,318
You need a plan.

219
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,887
It's not that easy.

220
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:01,856
Listen, this is very imporant.

221
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:06,161
You have to hypnotize her and
make her write the will.

222
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:10,834
Make her write down:
"I will leave all my money
to Klahadore."

223
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:18,406
Then I will be able
to inherit the money.

224
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:21,621
Very naturally.

225
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:27,015
It took me three years
to earn everyone's trust.

226
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:31,753
I'll make it look like an accident
and nobody will suspect me.

227
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:35,090
That's why you were butling
for three years.

228
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:39,594
("Kuro": Japanese for
"black" or "dark".)

229
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:43,710
Three years ago when you
suddenly said you quit,

230
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,469
<i>you found someone at
random to replace you.</i>

231
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,102
<i>And told them you were executed.</i>

232
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:05,654
Now I know it's the beginning
of the whole plan.

233
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:07,989
You are worth being called a genius.

234
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,058
Stop calling me a genius.

235
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,494
I gave up the title
three years ago.

236
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:17,132
I hope to get the money without
being chased by the government.

237
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:19,899
I am a pacifist.

238
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,938
What kind of pacifist are you?

239
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,877
For your own peace, you went and
killed the girl's family.

240
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:32,280
Hold on -- her father died
from natural causes.

241
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,182
That wasn't expected.

242
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,818
So what?
That doesn't matter.

243
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:39,421
Give us a sign when you're ready.

244
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:44,885
We've been anchored offshore
for about a week.

245
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,262
They are thirsty for blood.

246
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:56,664
<i>Something big happened.</i>

247
00:17:56,872 --> 00:18:00,070
<i>You are not going to believe this.</i>

248
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:04,212
Hey, what's up?
It sounds like an emergency.

249
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,047
Weren't you listening?

250
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,082
It's horrible!

251
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,917
They are serious!

252
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:10,552
That butler is Captain Kuro.

253
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,854
He is the smartest of all pirates.

254
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:15,807
Also the cruelest one.

255
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,528
I heard that he was arrested
by the navy and was executed.

256
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:22,997
I can't believe
Captain Kuro is still alive.

257
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,633
And became a butler.

258
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,902
He had it all planned.

259
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:31,542
For the last three years,
he plotted trying to get the money.

260
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,602
They're gonna attack the village!

261
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:40,113
<i>And kill Kaya!</i>

262
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:47,284
We're doomed!

263
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:55,808
Hey, don't stand up --
they'll see you!

264
00:18:57,032 --> 00:19:00,308
Hey you!
Don't kill Kaya!

265
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:03,238
Who was that?

266
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,007
Idiot!
They saw us!

267
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:08,288
We better run and hide
or we're dead!

268
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:09,644
Well...

269
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:12,436
Isn't it Usopp?

270
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:15,554
They found me too!

271
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:19,354
Heard anything interesting?

272
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,190
No, no, no!
What are you talking about?

273
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:25,059
I just got here and
didn't hear a thing!

274
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,669
We heard everything!

275
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,634
There is no way to avoid this.

276
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,072
Hey, kid!

277
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,409
Look at the ring.

278
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,244
What?

279
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:46,107
It's a weapon!
Let's go!

280
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:50,418
When I say
"One Two Django",
you will fall asleep.

281
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,986
OK?

282
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:54,789
One, Two...

283
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,358
Django!

284
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,564
Hey!
Get up, Django!

285
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:04,865
You never changed.

286
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:09,588
What're doing?
You're gonna fall!

287
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:16,811
He fell on his head.

288
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:19,514
I didn't want to kill him.

289
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:21,879
From that height,
he is dead for sure.

290
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,082
Damn them!

291
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,354
He's dead!
Damn them!

292
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:32,093
There is one more.
Should I kill him?

293
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,661
No need.

294
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:36,650
Nobody will believe him.

295
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:41,202
Let's do it tomorrow morning, Django.

296
00:20:41,203 --> 00:20:43,505
Attack when the day breaks.

297
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:47,775
Destroy some houses to
make it look like an accident.

298
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:50,174
And kill Miss Kaya!

299
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:52,780
Tomorrow?

300
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,250
You heard that, Usopp?

301
00:20:55,251 --> 00:21:00,247
No matter what you heard,
no one can stop my plan.

302
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,762
There isn't gonna be any problems, right?
- Of course not.

303
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,710
My plan won't be changed.

304
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:15,403
<i>Oh my God!
We're doomed!</i>

305
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:18,306
<i>Everyone in the village
will be killed!</i>

306
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:20,675
<i>Kaya is going to be killed!</i>

307
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:24,568
<i>And everyone I love!</i>

308
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,459
Who are you?

309
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,128
I am Usopp.

310
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:41,818
I am a brave fighter.

311
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,233
I heard you weren't feeling well.

312
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:47,802
Let me tell you a story to cheer you up.

313
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,704
It's none of your business!

314
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:53,165
Please leave, or I will call for help.

315
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:58,446
Then what?
What's next?

316
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:01,349
Of course,
I fought him like a soldier.

317
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,379
I first used the cat stick to
take the huge cat down.

318
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,862
BASTARDS!

319
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:13,114
Usopp's running.
His face looks angry.
What happened?

320
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,749
The butler is a pirate.

321
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,984
He had his men attack the village.

322
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:19,220
It's good to know
that in advance.

323
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,955
Let's slip away, don't worry.

324
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:21,956
Hey!
- What's going on?

325
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:24,792
I have to buy some meat, or
the boss will be gone.

326
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:26,694
What are you thinking?

327
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,129
Next "One Piece":

328
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,699
"Revealing the Conspiracy!
The Pirate Caretaker, Captain Kuro"

329
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,248
I want to be the king of the pirates!

1
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:13,660
Bong blood, you then. Ones like the others.

2
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:17,508
Why are you if limited
when they are your comrades?

3
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:19,797
This is not there…

4
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:28,499
A single chance to escape to you?!

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,107
Wait!

6
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,187
I do not seek to flee!

7
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,221
Wait, Robin-chan…

8
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:45,892
Why you continuous say that?

9
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:50,347
We had just saved with full knowledge of the facts.

10
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:54,092
We will find something
for Buster Call of the government,

11
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:57,461
thus Robin-chan, you do not have any more any reason
to want to remain with them!

12
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:06,233
Buster Call… is precisely the problem.

13
00:01:13,564 --> 00:01:14,667
** TECHNICAL ** Rankyaku

14
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,867
Sanji!

15
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,950
It is what this type…

16
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:33,297
It left null leaves!!

17
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,264
They is not good… I must do something…

18
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:47,892
Stop!

19
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:48,455
Is Que'?

20
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:49,641
Let make!

21
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,224
He you, I am your H!

22
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,498
Left! When it has…

23
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,000
Where did it go? Where it is?!

24
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:18,515
The legal island!
The portrait of Enies Lobby!

25
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,944
Did Blueno disappear?

26
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,114
It did not disappear.

27
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,169
It is the capacity of its fruit of the demon.

28
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,582
With truth capacity of the fruit doa-doa, Air-Door,

29
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:39,505
It created a door in the atmosphere even.

30
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,746
It is impossible to escape to us.

31
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,384
To in no case.

32
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,004
Leave Robin…

33
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,113
… by!

34
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:05,752
** TECHNICAL ** Shigan

35
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,211
Usopp!

** TECHNICAL ** Tekkai

37
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,006
You did not hear me presently?

38
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,143
Your kicks are weak.

39
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,861
You are persistent…

40
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:40,800
Stop!

41
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:45,826
I do not hope to flee…

42
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,597
That should suffir you.

43
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,098
It is them which came to me.

44
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:53,012
I did not have the choice.

45
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:56,450
In this case let us leave from here immediately.

46
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:01,614
Wait!

47
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:08,459
All is well.

48
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:09,821
Robin…

49
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,165
All well will occur.

50
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,435
You…

51
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,394
we still hide something.

52
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,777
That does not have… not importance.

53
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,268
Only, one pirate…

54
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:35,691
cannot leave…

55
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,272
the crew without the agreement…

56
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,209
of the Captain.

57
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:46,279
Then…

58
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:47,735
you…

59
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:51,293
must believe in Luffy.

60
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:43,846
Wait, Robin-chan!

61
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,220
Useless.

62
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:47,615
Nico Robin will not romprera his promise.

63
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,590
Why you say that?

64
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:53,793
A long time ago, an island was destroyed.

65
00:07:55,317 --> 00:08:00,143
This island, on which was launched Buster Call of the navy,

66
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:02,503
was entirely reduced in ash.

67
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,565
The only surviving one of then was…

68
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,204
a young girl still in low age:Nico Robin.

69
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:09,980
What do you say?

70
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:14,280
Five vice-admirals and ten men-of-war.

71
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:18,947
For this woman, who had to face this insurmountable power,

72
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:22,548
Buster Call represents a demon which it cannot flee.

73
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:26,106
This terror which it traumatize since its childhood…

74
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,292
… is now turned against his companions.

75
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:32,099
It lost the will to be opposed to us.

76
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:36,561
Me known as step… knowing all that…

77
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:39,537
It is obvious.

78
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,713
Bandage refuse…

79
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,400
Where your rot stops?!

80
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,258
It is for the good of justice!

81
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:56,027
I test a deep compassion for it.

82
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,430
Insane steps of me!

83
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:22,048
MAKE CHIEEER ~!

84
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:27,770
You!

85
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,390
Dépèche you and will sit you, Nico Robin.

86
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,619
We will arrive at Enies Lobby soon.

87
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,364
Wait one second! I wait said!

88
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:55,461
Is this reasonable? To leave these two there together…

89
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:58,029
I entrust them to you until one arrives.

90
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,536
Before that, which could occur?

91
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:03,660
They do not have any more the possibility of fleeing.

92
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,471
Soon, criminals vis-a-vis their death…

93
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:10,628
will not be able that to deplore their fate.

94
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:31,541
A liking…

95
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:32,458
A liking…

96
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:35,710
One…

97
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,959
A frog!!

98
00:10:40,347 --> 00:10:43,415
Y has of “Gero” which holds, idiotic!

99
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:47,557
Because of your surprised attack, one east left the rails!!

100
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:51,354
Release! Move! One will strike you!

101
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:56,705
Whereas one was on the point of
to catch up with Sanji and others!

102
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,313
Why you ace does that?!

103
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,855
Dumb, I will puff out you!!

104
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:15,102
What occurs at the end, with this Umi Ressha?

105
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,096
Is everyone well?

106
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,133
More or less…

107
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,375
My… My kidneys…

108
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,943
It is what this bins?

109
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:33,479
King bulldozers disappeared!!

110
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,309
They are there?

111
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:38,857
Not, it is we who disappeared.

112
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,050
One probably ran off the line.

113
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,774
It is still worse!!

114
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,042
What will one make?

115
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:48,628
It does not matter what one tries, one can nothing make!

116
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:51,434
Zoro?

117
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,393
You want to laugh, there?

118
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:03,130
Semi… Miracle!

119
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:10,772
And here.

120
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:14,048
Bong blood, crowned Yokozuna.

121
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,464
In here are in the manners.

122
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,002
Does Ca go?

123
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,221
Yes, about…

124
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,511
This dirty Yokozuna!

125
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,301
Good, it would be said that all is well.

126
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,986
You are well?

127
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:36,403
I hope that one can always reach Enies Lobby!

128
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,622
Close it a little!

129
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:40,181
Wait one second!

130
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,048
It is easy to say.

131
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,725
It would be said that one is taken in an odd current…

132
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,614
What this master key?

133
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,647
Kokoro-san?

134
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:50,641
You know the direction of the island?

135
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:57,918
Yes, Umi Resha contains Eternal Poses
from each island where there is a station.

136
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,494
Then all is well.

137
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,631
I will look at the ocean, I leave you with the operation!

138
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:03,968
You are…?

139
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,281
Me?

140
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:07,969
Navigatrice.

141
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,867
I see. It is promising.

142
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:16,577
But initially…

143
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:20,605
Yokozuna! Bring back yourself two minutes here!

144
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,392
It jumped!

145
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:39,005
How that you is content that I do not have anything! Good blood!

146
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:42,269
I was not kidnapped.

147
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:43,895
Do not draw from hasty conclusions!

148
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,790
Baa-chan speaks with Yokozuna

149
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,483
You made what the guy?

150
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,947
The frog of presently speaks with the old woman.

151
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,750
Then is the old woman a frog?

152
00:14:02,797 --> 00:14:05,568
It is true that it resembles more one frog than with human…

153
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,299
When that is finished it will knock you…

154
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,121
It is clear.

155
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,704
Mugiwara-san! Rocket Man!

156
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:14,761
You find them?

157
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,164
Not, nowhere.

158
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,369
Shit. This large frog…

159
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,951
Where did it send Straw hat and the others?

160
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,933
The guy!! It is not the moment for that!!

161
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:28,643
One took the sea to go to save Franky-aniki!

162
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:32,222
It is true! We must believe that Rocket Man will return…

163
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,544
and to direct us towards Enie Lobby!

164
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:38,502
Put the package Sodom, Gomura!

165
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:45,896
Look in front!

166
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:49,971
There are still coaches detached on the rails!

167
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,073
Friends or enemies, it is not known!

168
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:54,185
Everyone, you with the combat prepare!

169
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:00,666
Who is inside?

170
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,392
We are Franky Family!

171
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,290
You show!

172
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,307
Somebody left!

173
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,427
It is… twisted eyebrow?

174
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,435
Here the chef de gare of Enies Lobby.

175
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,642
Is the situation normal?

176
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:19,928
Yes.

177
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,572
Without delay,

178
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,463
We bring two prisionners.

179
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,138
We can see the island, therefore we will arrive soon.

180
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:30,977
Included/understood. We will be ready to receive you.

181
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,898
I missed it.

182
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,026
Not astonishing after being parties five years.

183
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,627
The island without night:Enies Lobby.

184
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:46,191
It is alive?

185
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,972
Really? It is true?

186
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:51,551
Yes.

187
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,005
It is what he said to me.

188
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:56,551
I see.

189
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,616
I see…

190
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:01,741
I am happy.

191
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,517
Imbecile of bakaberg. I really believed that he had died…

192
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,539
I see.

193
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,218
I am relieved.

194
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:12,066
Didn't the CP9 want to kill it?

195
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,638
It would be preferable that you do not speak about it.

196
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:18,852
It would not be…

197
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:21,505
what one calls kindness?

198
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:31,075
This being,

199
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,957
The government has the plans now
old weapon, by me;

200
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,773
and can awake the weapons which still exist, with you.

201
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:45,223
What wants to say that it has skilfully
put the hand on the two keys.

202
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:51,406
Once such a capacity will be of return in the world…

203
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:56,009
The government will put an end to the era pirates.

204
00:16:56,241 --> 00:17:00,785
This unverifiable military power will unbalance
the world and will cause its destruction…

205
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:02,603
Old weapons…

206
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,963
are such threats.

207
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:06,731
Our Master…

208
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,819
its life sacrificed to protect the plans.

209
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,565
By for a future also merdic.

210
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,260
Consequently,

211
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:20,009
even if I can flee, only that does not have any direction.

212
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:23,837
In one way or another, you must turn over
near Straw hat.

213
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,152
Impossible.

214
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:29,588
The only fact of being at their sides would wound them.

215
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:38,101
At the moment when it came in the world,
its existence even became a crime.

216
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:45,334
But it is not you who will wound them, hein?

217
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:51,942
People of the government have beautiful
to regard your existence as a crime,

218
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:54,445
some is the plague which one carries in oneself,

219
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,780
the fact of being there cannot be a crime.

220
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,056
Whatever the ship…

221
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:08,044
What you build is neither good nor bad.

222
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:09,832
This is why…

223
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,683
Its existence even is a crime.

224
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,033
Forgery!

225
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:19,513
The fact of existing cannot be a crime.

226
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:30,912
Frankly…

227
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,037
what you ace made with your body?

228
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,010
You are covered with scars!

229
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:36,588
You…

230
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,953
since 8 years, this famous day…

231
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:43,663
where Tom-san was taken along, since this business…

232
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,563
day after day,

233
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,341
you face Umi Resha without répis.

234
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,139
You wanted to become stronger, not true?

235
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:09,494
More never not to lose a expensive being,

236
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:13,487
to protect those which are expensive to you…

237
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:16,707
Yokozuna!

238
00:19:17,106 --> 00:19:21,259
It is the moment to show the result of this drive.

239
00:19:24,794 --> 00:19:27,297
Your dear Franky…

240
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,807
was taken along in the same way that Tom-san.

241
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:35,563
In this moment this train moves towards him.

242
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:39,206
You want to come with us?

243
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:48,031
Mugiwara! We have a new ally!

244
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:50,038
Ouais, I included/understood!

245
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,678
Impressive, the old woman-monster.

246
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:56,227
Not, it would not be the old woman-frog?

247
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,294
Which is this?

248
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,342
Ca does not have any importance!

249
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:04,539
Kokoro-san!

250
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:07,111
I found a good running at eight hours!

251
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,297
Go.

252
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,680
We lost much,

253
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,592
then all let us recover!

254
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:17,457
Allons-y, frog!

255
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,671
The CP9 arrived! Dépéchez you!

256
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,630
Beautiful work for this long mission!

257
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,539
Seek the prisoners! They are in the first car!

258
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:36,060
Dumb!

259
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:38,796
Take better care of me, poor idiot!!

260
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:41,447
Who you think that I am brothel?!

261
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:43,772
Does not approach!

262
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:45,687
Ridges attention!! It bites!!

263
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,648
You understand anything my word?!

264
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:50,207
Go ahead molo! Morons!

265
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:50,420
Which noisy man.

266
00:20:57,486 --> 00:20:59,153
It is well the CP9…

267
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,903
Which impressive imposing presence.

268
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,955
He, it is well Cutty Flam?

269
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,372
Then, this woman would be…

270
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,333
Nico Robin.

271
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,106
What a beautée!

272
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,454
Open the Main door.

273
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:35,658
It is what this place?!

274
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:48,211
It is… a cascade…

275
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,411
It is what this island good blood?!

1
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:24,590
The resolution of Dalton!

2
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:24,590
The army of Wapol Unloads.

3
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,580
It is a snow-covered island!

4
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,490
These mountains are Drum Rockies.

5
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,620
Located on the most peak, in the center of the mountains,

6
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,340
a woman saw whom people call

7
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,070
“witch”, the single doctor of the country,

8
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,890
Dr. Kureha.

9
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:12,860
He Nami.

10
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,480
Cling!

11
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,680
One goes there!

12
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,270
Take guard in Laphan.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,980
It is a voracious rabbit race.

14
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,840
If you meet them, it is assured death.

15
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,460
They have the speed of rabbit, and bear forces it.

16
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,420
They generally attack in group.

17
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,510
We break!

18
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,730
What do they make?

19
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,110
These foutus rabbits! It is not true!

20
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,120
Do Oh He, Sanji, what occur?

21
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,120
What does it occur?

22
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Let us leave, Luffy!

23
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,090
To flee? But where?

24
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,610
Anywhere! Also far you can!

25
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,940
Too much late!
THEY HAVE CAUSES AN AVALANCHE!

26
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,530
These Rabbit whores!

27
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,240
They will pay it!

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,110
What does one make?
How one draws from there, Sanji?

29
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,120
I do not know!

30
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,410
But in any case, the 1st priority, it is Nami!

31
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,030
2nd:Nami-San!

32
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,770
3rd:Nami-San!

33
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,610
4th:Nami-San!

34
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,380
5th:Nami-San!

35
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,790
You ace measuring rod?

36
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,960
Manage to save it!

37
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,370
Included/understood!

38
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,840
But how?

39
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,340
There! This rock!

40
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,470
A rock?

41
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,140
Course!

42
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,260
We must put ourselves in height!

43
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,230
It arrives!

44
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,790
Ouf! It was less one!

45
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh not!

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,210
It is not high enough!

47
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,210
It is Wapol!

48
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,740
Wapol returned!

49
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,880
What?

50
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,720
Dalton moves towards Bighorn!

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,440
That all those which can fight,
take the weapons in direction of Bighorn!

52
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,930
Quickly! That those which are ready to fight,
on the way for Bighorn!

53
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,980
All at the sides of Dalton-San!

54
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,190
All at the sides of Dalton-San!
Wapol is of return!

55
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,780
With the weapons everyone!

56
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,150
Let us protect our country!

57
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,360
With the weapons!
On the way for Bighorn!

58
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,620
YES!

59
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,500
He, Vivi. Be sure for you that one is on the good way

60
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,370
is Gyasta village where this witch?

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,750
Now that you say it, I am more very sure…

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,090
If are not sure for you, one in one is crowned kneader!

63
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,680
Imagine that Luffy and the others arrive at the castle and that they see that there is no doctor.

64
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,510
They will set out again by wondering where it passed!

65
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,260
If we do not find the doctor quickly
to say to him to turn over to the castle…

66
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,020
I know that, but…

67
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,980
If you know, then do something.
Be to you a Princess, not true?

68
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,810
Ca does not have anything to see!

69
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,690
I am not a witch, I am a Princess.

70
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,570
Ouais, ouais…

71
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,740
Then why you would not look at the chart, Usopp-San?

72
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,570
Would not be idiot!

73
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,160
All is covered with snow… One can nothing make some even with a good chart.

74
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,890
Then, you do not know either where one moves?

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,540
Not!

76
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,450
I have any idea absolutely of it!!!

77
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,210
You should not be about it to trust.

78
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,960
At all events. Some share along this way, one would have
normally to have a panel for Gyasta.

79
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,460
One should not miss it.

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,490
Well! You can count on me!

81
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,970
You can trust me! No problemo!

82
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,860
He, you listenings what I do say?

83
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,560
DELICIOUS!

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,920
, You listen others!

85
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,900
All in this country

86
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,240
is my snack!

87
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,390
I am…

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,390
VERY POWERFUL!

89
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
And why…

90
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,270
Kuromarimo!

91
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,200
Say to them!

92
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,790
Naturally!

93
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,120
It is because you are the King!
Your Glorious Highness.

94
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,540
It is exact!

95
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,630
Exactly!

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,670
This is why, I must have my cooked houses at point!

97
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,670
Wapol-Sama.
I have new information to report to you.

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,430
Which?

99
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,890
If I then to allow me…

100
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,560
We received information

101
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,430
that the pirate with the straw hat and them his
would move in direction of your castle.

102
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,500
What?

103
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,390
Why?

104
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,060
They transport a sick woman
over there to consult a doctor.

105
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,730
These morons!

106
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,030
There is no doctor in my castle!

107
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,740
There is nobody any more over there!

108
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,070
Moreover, of the same report/ratio,

109
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,740
It would seem that Dr.Kureha

110
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,930
currently lives in your castle.

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,250
WHAT?

112
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,540
Is this old witch in my castle?

113
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,300
Until where she will humiliate me?

114
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,550
Listen!

115
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,360
I will foutrai it outside.

116
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,430
And I will puff out it, it and this snotty-nosed kid with the straw hat!

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,580
My brave men.

118
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,220
We will turn over to the castle!

119
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,810
OUAIS!

120
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,930
Ca is enough!

121
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,850
Who dared…

122
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,530
Ahh! It cut me!

123
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,820
I will die!

124
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,400
Dalton-San!

125
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,070
I came to kill you.

126
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,910
Your death is only justice!

127
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,410
Dalton, salts bastard!

128
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,040
Then be to you always in life?

129
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,620
You dared to raise the hand on Wapol-sama…

130
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,500
Alas, not sufficiently.

131
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,960
You qualified doctors de Drum,

132
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,630
eminent doctors of the country.

133
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
Just.

134
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,510
Isshi-20, Surgical Team!

135
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,510
It is with you!

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,010
Loan for the operation.

137
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,890
Loan for the operation.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
Loan for the operation.

139
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,720
Loan for the operation.

140
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
Loan for the operation.

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,560
Loan for the operation.

142
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
Loan for the operation.

143
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,350
Scalpel.

144
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,810
Fasten.

145
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,520
Plates.

146
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,020
Hammer.

147
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,110
Wow. I believed that I was going to remain there!!

148
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,370
Thinking only of your person, you prohibited

149
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,360
with people of this country right to consult doctors.

150
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,780
They had of another choice to only suffer from their diseases.

151
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,030
Wapol!

152
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:44,990
Wapol?

153
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,830
It is Wapol-Sama!

154
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,620
Dalton, my vassal.

155
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,130
It is true!

156
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,370
You do not have the right to address to you to him this manner.

157
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,320
Formerly, you were like us two,
advisers of Wapol-Sama.

158
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,010
Aren't we its honest servants?

159
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,040
It is true that while
you inflicted these sufferings with the people,

160
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,120
all that I did as vassal

161
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,260
was to observe and let make.

162
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,980
I assume the responsibility for it.

163
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,070
Wapol.

164
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
Let us leave this island.

165
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,100
We do not have any more our place here.

166
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,280
Dalton-San! You did not do anything of evil!

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,440
It is true!

168
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,110
You are the only member of the government

169
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,910
who fought for us, to defend our country!

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,370
Even with the danger of your life!

171
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,930
He!

172
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,830
It would have better done to die as
Captain of the Guard of Royaune de Drum.

173
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,340
I am, in any case, surprised that you have
survived in a country without any doctor.

174
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,460
The other countries consider that the kingdom of Drum
is very advanced in the medical field.

175
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,570
But what they are unaware of,

176
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,980
it is that only 20 “doctors of elite”
work in the laboratories of the castle,

177
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,350
while all other doctors
were condemned to the exile!

178
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,640
Of course!

179
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,770
Thus, those which fall sick must beg me for their life!

180
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,860
It is according to my mood, it is not like
if I did not want to let to you see Isshi-20.

181
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,070
If you do not want to die, then you must venerate me.

182
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,700
How a king!

183
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,060
What makes my capacity absolute.

184
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,500
It is my way of controlling!

185
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,250
Do THESE METHODS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH the POLICY?

186
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,290
Ca is there you finished.

187
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,700
Cut down it!

188
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,840
Kill your former chief!

189
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,130
I knew that you would not include/understand
even if I said it opposite to you.

190
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,310
I always studded myself with the hope
that the son of the advised sovereign that I was useful

191
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,020
would end up opening the eyes, but it is without hope!

192
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,320
Ushi = Bull

193
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,320
Caution! The fruit Ushi Ushi!

194
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,780
Model:Bison!

195
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,200
Do not hesitate!

196
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,160
Fire!

197
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,780
I am not able to touch it!

198
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,830
He dodges all the balls!

199
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,580
Old subordinate clauses or not, I will be without pity!

200
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,270
He is too strong! Which power…

201
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,970
Zoan:(Zoanthrope) human able to metamorphose itself in animal.

202
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,830
It is the Fruit of the Demon of the Zoan family!

203
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,970
The force in a wild state!

204
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,310
I do not test any more any pity for you!

205
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,270
A country whose King escapes with the first sign of danger

206
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,570
do not deserve to exist!

207
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,850
You do not have any chance vis-a-vis us two.

208
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,070
Give up.

209
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,110
Dalton-San!

210
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,120
Dalton-San!

211
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,650
One came to help you!

212
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,080
One came to fight!

213
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
One came to save our country of tyranny!

214
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Your problem, it is that we are of old knowledge.

215
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,970
Damage for you!

216
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,180
Stop!

217
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,930
I know your weakness…

218
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,940
Why?

219
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,320
It protected us!

220
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,990
Dalton-San!

221
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,070
Dalton-San!

222
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,700
Dalton-San…

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,200
Here it is your weak point!

224
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,830
You are too nice Dalton-Kun.

225
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,330
Here is a death worthy of you!

226
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,880
It is what that?

227
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,630
It is what? A seism?

228
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,220
It is bad that!
Snow is so thick that one cannot advance any more.

229
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,600
One took the wrong road,
one was inserted too much in the mountain.

230
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,380
It is what this tremor?

231
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,770
Ussop-San?

232
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,530
You believe that it is…

233
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,360
An avalanche!

234
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,700
25.631!

235
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,530
25.632!

236
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,700
25.633!

237
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,660
Hein? It is what that?

238
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,580
It is bloody noisy!

239
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,220
25.634…

240
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,320
Oh not! It is not high enough!

241
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,830
What could I make?

242
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,090
Ah, I know!

243
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,340
SANJI!

244
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,800
Catches!

245
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,470
Saved!

246
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,890
Ouais, but…

247
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,060
Even if one is not absorbed by the avalanche,

248
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,480
one goes down again at any speed the way which we have just climbed!

249
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,650
WHAT?

250
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,650
You laugh!

251
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,650
One was nearly the foot of the mountain to be climbed.

252
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,890
One was with a step of the castle of the doctor!

253
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,240
Luffy! Find a means of stopping this trick!

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,330
Brothel! Rabbit filths!

255
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,190
The next time that they are seen, one transforms them into stew!

256
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,130
WHAT?

257
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,180
What does one make, Sanji?

258
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,370
There is only one thing to make…

259
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,140
TO FLEE!

260
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,060
It is what these insane furious?

261
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,570
ATTENTION, Luffy!

262
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,240
Look in front!

263
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,910
Ahh! A rock!

264
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,370
One will be caught it!

265
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,750
That should be avoided!

266
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,340
Do not forget only you carry Nami-San on your back!

267
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
You say that in vain, but…

268
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,810
ONE SE WILL TAKE IT!!

269
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,440
You must always treat Ladies…

270
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:32,710
Hein?

271
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,900
carefully!

272
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,070
Sanji!

273
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,210
Sanji!

274
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,250
I am inserted, shit!

275
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,320
Moron!

276
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,880
Remake a similar trick never again!

277
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,310
SANJI!

278
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,720
SANJI!

279
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,810
SANJI!

280
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,820
It arrives!

281
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,950
It does not stop!

282
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,990
The whole city will be buried!

283
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,570
Save which can!

284
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,040
Let us flee!

285
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,540
Chess! Kuromarimo!

286
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,040
Go up!

287
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,040
Robson!

288
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,570
Robson!

289
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,790
Passes in mode “serious things”!

290
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,130
Wapol-Sama!

291
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,840
Take us along too!

292
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,130
The farm!

293
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,140
You clear up all alone!

294
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,010
More quickly, Robson!

295
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,760
It is already there!

296
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,400
All… All… All will be well!

297
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,270
No panic Vivi!

298
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,780
Even if you are made take by the avalanche, I should save you!!

299
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,530
He, Luffy-San and others…

300
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,910
Luffy-San and the others are perhaps
taken with the trap in this avalanche?

301
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,040
Wapol-Sama!

302
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,220
Are Nami, you cold?

303
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,990
Hold out still a little.

304
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,390
Listen, keeps to me that and await me here.

305
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,740
What, it is you the guy?

306
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,870
I wondered what gave this unpleasant syrup taste.

307
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,540
It is still them, I bet.

308
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,000
Which want you to speak?

309
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,290
Bah! It was THEM!

310
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,170
Who that “them”?

311
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,170
Pirates of Straw hat.

312
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,320
You said that they move towards my castle, not true?

313
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,050
And here what arrives!

314
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,260
These small rancorous wants
to be avenged for what one did to them!

315
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,770
They caused an avalanche in the mountain!

316
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,560
Ah! It is thus that which occurred!

317
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Then this avalanche belonged to their plan!

318
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,430
Allons-y!

319
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,940
Let us follow their traces in the mountain!

320
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,090
I will teach them what it is a true battle of snows!

321
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,810
I will take you along up there.

322
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,510
Especially, do not die.

323
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,210
Both.

324
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,340
I see them!

325
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,330
Look at, Wapol-Sama.

326
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,220
They are over there.

327
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,600
Wait, kid!

328
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,510
You dared to carry reached to my person on several occasions!

329
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,390
You will pay it to me!

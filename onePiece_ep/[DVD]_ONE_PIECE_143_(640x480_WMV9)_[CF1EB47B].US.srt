1
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:01,130
And then the Legend started!

2
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:01,130
Until the end of the Rainbow.

3
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,010
Father, that exceeds all our hopes.

4
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,530
Look at that. All the treasures present here are from now on with me.

5
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,800
Leave from here!

6
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,450
He the guy!

7
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,820
Of made not too much!

8
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,890
This is the property of Pumpkin Pirates.

9
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,670
As long as Lapanui will not have returned, we will defend this place!

10
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:38,770
Professor!

11
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,940
I am also a member of Pumpkin Pirates!

12
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,820
I will fight at your sides!

13
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,520
I will also help you, Ossan!

14
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,860
Professor!

15
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,590
I was touched!

16
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,160
Bandage imbeciles. How can you let these kids walk you on the feet!?

17
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,810
Whetton!

18
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,050
It did not change since the last time!

19
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,960
Not, in fact, I am the grandson of Whetton, Reik.

20
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,100
One resembles oneself this point?

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Ouais, almost identical!

22
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,020
Is Oh, it true?

23
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,930
Then Grand-père was as beautiful as that.

24
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,640
What does it have?

25
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,790
Which strange character…

26
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,210
Give us the treasure immediately!

27
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,970
Or I will use this electric combination to reduce to you in ashes!

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,590
Take guard! This type uses electricity!

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,770
Electricity, hein?

30
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,400
I was held there, waiting patiently until you attack me.

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,700
If electricity is your only weapon, I will use my katanas…

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,630
and to cut it into two!

33
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,140
Hum, one cannot do that with electricity…

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,060
Ca with the funny air.

35
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,240
Thus test!

36
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,150
I awaited that impatiently!

37
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,070
It is calm, you do not find?

38
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,290
Ouais, too calm.

39
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,910
I wonder whether everyone is well…

40
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,020
Who knows.

41
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,020
“Which knows”?! How can you say a similar thing!?

42
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,440
Aren't you anxious for the others?

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,630
One does not have to be done some for them.

44
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,260
The question is more to know if this moron of Mayor will return or not.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,640
If Luffy puts a beating to him,

46
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,430
We will not have to pay these taxes.

47
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,200
Ouais, you are right.

48
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,780
One goes there?

49
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,880
Ouais, it left.

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,110
GOMU GOMU NO!

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,300
ROCKET!

52
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,600
What is it that?

53
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,110
One stopped.

54
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,670
C-captain!

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
V you, dumbs!

56
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,150
How you dared to penetrate in my Rainbow of the Fogs!

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,460
Pay maintaining to me a tax of 50 million Berrys to be entered there!

58
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,000
Not.

59
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,210
What you ace known as!?

60
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,310
Do you want to say that you will not obey the order of Whetton-sama!?

61
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,370
Whetton…

62
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,600
It is you!

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,360
Yes, I am the tall one and splendid Maire of Ruluka, Whetton!

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,840
What!? A pirate who proclaimed itself Maire!?

65
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,690
Does Ca pose a problem to you!?

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,100
C-captain! This kid, it is him which stole our ship!

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,870
What?

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,480
T you are… the horrible brat of the other time?

69
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Then was Ruluka set fire to and you became Maire?

70
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,730
I cannot accept that!

71
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,300
I will never accept that!

72
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,810
Your mouth!

73
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,530
Lapanui!

74
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,530
Kid, being Maire it is brilliant.

75
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,790
You remainders sitting with your office and you take the money which the citizens gained hard.

76
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,290
You drive out your enemies and you have never to worry about be stopped by the Navy.

77
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,590
Each day is like a paradise for me!

78
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,780
It is really an easy work.

79
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,000
Since you returned, you should try to obtain a capacity such as mine!

80
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,490
Compared with the statute of Mayor, to play pirate is a waste of time.

81
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,860
Captain!

82
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,880
Father!

83
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,630
Dumb, which are you…?

84
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,630
You do not know what is a true pirate.

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,600
What?

86
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,010
Luffy…

87
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,750
The capacity is useless.

88
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,030
We, the pirates, have a dream.

89
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,540
Does U-Un dream…?

90
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,960
My electric combination is invulnerable.

91
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,160
You will not escape to me!

92
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,040
To escape? Who would do that?

93
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,850
I said that I was going to cut your electricity!

94
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,480
Is explained, what you understands by “cutting” electricity?

95
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,760
We should cut it.

96
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,190
Take that!

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,300
Rolling Thunder!

98
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:00,980
Hein?

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,750
What occurs?

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,640
If the energy source is cut, that becomes useless, not?

101
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,560
Fact of shitting!

102
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
Why did you make a similar thing?

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,470
Give the current, small bitch!

104
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,490
Would be cursed!

105
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,780
It is cheating, whore…!

106
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,000
He, I need a knack!

107
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,280
I run! I run!

108
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,670
Save me, somebody?!

109
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,280
Close it!

110
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,840
A dream?

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,390
What does that want to say?

112
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,470
I would like to know what is this “dream” that you all have.

113
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,540
You want just gold and money, not?

114
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,680
With capacity, you can precisely fill the pockets.

115
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,990
The dream of a pirate…

116
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,560
Is to become more the great man on the sea.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,400
I am that which will become the Lord of the Pirates!

118
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,680
Luffy…

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,790
Fact of shitting!

120
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,920
None of those which fought against me survived!

121
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,510
Now you with being prepare put in parts!

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,920
Wait, Capitaine!

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,320
Father, I want to come too!

124
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,760
I of insane!

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,920
Captain!

126
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,580
It still occurs something!

127
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,220
The Tower of the Rainbow!

128
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,620
It is destroyed!

129
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,620
Whore…

130
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,130
What occurs?

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,710
It gave up us here…

132
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,880
Whetton, dumb!

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,310
It is not any more my captain!

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,660
Make shit!

135
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,530
Luffy!

136
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,920
Lapanui!

137
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,620
It is Lapanui!

138
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,990
It returned!

139
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,940
Thank you my god… Lapanui.

140
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,290
This time, I really was afraid for him.

141
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,350
Whore, this guy is really emmerdant.

142
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,920
Q - What is it that?

143
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,590
Would this be?

144
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,720
Professor?

145
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,150
The existence of Ape' S Concert rests on a very fragile balance.

146
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,530
Following this giant explosion,

147
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,810
One cannot know what it will occur!

148
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,100
It is what this brothel?

149
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,800
The distortion of space develops!

150
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,190
At this speed, one all will be aspired and killed!

151
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,360
What!?

152
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,250
I cannot believe in it…

153
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,720
The Tower of the Rainbow…

154
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,980
Completely buried.

155
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,750
Whore. I knew that it was not finished, but I did not think that it was going to disintegrate.

156
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,710
But good, that does not have any more importance.

157
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,590
Maintaining this pitiful band of morons will return never again.

158
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,000
The treasure is with me!

159
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,630
The sky falls…

160
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,890
We do not have much any more of time!

161
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,630
Surely less than one hour!

162
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,830
One is badly barred! One must leave from there!

163
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,720
But… how?

164
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,270
The author of this book wrote these pages apart from Ape' S Concert.

165
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,000
The means of leaving must be written in it.

166
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,010
Q - What is it?

167
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,490
“The continuation in last volume…”

168
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,440
Where is it?

169
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,860
YOU DO NOT HAVE It!?!?

170
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,700
Over there!

171
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,260
What is there?

172
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,090
Luffy, this light!

173
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,510
It is the sunlight!

174
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,710
The light of a sunset!

175
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,610
A sunset!?

176
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,790
There is a breach in space…

177
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,650
And the sunlight is engulfed inside!

178
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,920
Presently, we ran towards this light and we almost left!

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,000
V-Vraiment?

180
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,980
We dispatch!

181
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,630
This light can disappear constantly!

182
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,670
Hoist the sail!

183
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,860
Everyone! Take the oars and put all your forces there!

184
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,440
Ouais!

185
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,010
He, the guy, go up!

186
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,030
Lend to us strong hand!

187
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,140
One from goes away from here!

188
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,020
Ok…

189
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,420
But brothel, what you insane?

190
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,070
Be satisfied to row!

191
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,540
It is what I do whore!

192
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,520
Ah, they broke!

193
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,670
What do you foutez!?

194
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,750
Shit, one is badly barred!

195
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,090
He, look at, the light attenuates!

196
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,490
Is this the end…?

197
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,390
You them guy, go down and push!

198
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,260
Be sick for you!?

199
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,740
If you push all together, then perhaps…

200
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,880
CRETIN!

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,620
So only there was a powerful wind…

202
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,280
You require that the wind blows?

203
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,040
He! What do you make!?

204
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,910
I will explode our ship!

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,120
It is a ship of the Navy after all.

206
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,880
There is a large cargo of boulets de canon.

207
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,420
If I light them,

208
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,430
They will cause an enormous wind!

209
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,580
But…

210
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,900
Wait, Lapanui!

211
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,980
If you do that, then you will be…

212
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,970
What will it arrive to you!?

213
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,660
My treasure!

214
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,650
Mine!

215
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,640
Now I will be Maire for always!

216
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,120
He.

217
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,550
I think that our companions are inside this fog.

218
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,590
What doesn't go?

219
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,720
I hope that you will not say to me that you returned only?

220
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,290
Then?

221
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,820
He, remains there!

222
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,940
Lapanui!

223
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,090
He, where do you go? Return!

224
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,360
We are Pumpkin Pirates!

225
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,170
We swore always to remain together, with our companions, until death!

226
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,210
The guy…

227
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,950
Lapanui plunged to save you the guy!

228
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,730
Do not waste its bravery!

229
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,090
You will do nothing but die with him!

230
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,010
We will not die!

231
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,950
Henzo, we will return!

232
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,420
It does not matter how much years that will take, we will return in Ruluka!

233
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,530
Isoka…

234
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,820
Dirty waste!

235
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,530
Do not think that you can attack the Mayor and you to leave there also easily!

236
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,550
The militia of the city will make you pay 90 million Berrys!

237
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,200
You will regret it!

238
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,100
I have of it really anything with foutre them.

239
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,390
There is already boot to them the bottom.

240
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,460
What?

241
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,210
But it is the duty of the citizens to pay taxes!

242
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,140
Why the pirates should pay taxes?

243
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,940
B-Ben…

244
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,950
Sanji!

245
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,040
The Rainbow of the Fogs…

246
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,870
Disappears!

247
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,480
What?

248
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,080
Luffy and others…

249
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,580
What their did it arrive?

250
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,720
Now they will return never again!

251
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,170
Never!

252
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,960
No matter what you make,

253
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,690
There is no weakness with my capacity!

254
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,120
Up there!

255
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,530
What!?

256
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,540
What occurs!?

257
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,020
Merry!

258
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,700
Are they well?

259
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,380
My castle!

260
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,240
Ca carries all my richnesses!

261
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,950
Nami-san! Friends!

262
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,540
Not, how is this possible!?

263
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,490
Our ship…

264
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,090
Sanji, that made a long time!

265
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
Nami-swan-!

266
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,260
Why…!?

267
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,120
Hmm, I am irritated so much!

268
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,940
Why, Nami-san…?

269
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,710
All the treasures which we had on board are flown away.

270
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,080
I advise you to remain far from it during a small moment.

271
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,050
It of it is enough, pirate!

272
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,870
Navy?

273
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,200
In fact the types pursued us front!

274
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,990
Save us!

275
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,830
These gangsters try to steal the goods of the citizens!

276
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,050
This jewel was stolen by pirates 100 years ago and one believed it lost forever.

277
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
The Ring of the Illusia Queen.

278
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,570
Why is it in your possession?

279
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,290
Ben, you see…

280
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,260
I hope that you did not steal it.

281
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,620
Not! It is absurd!

282
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,800
This treasure was hidden in Ape' S Concert!

283
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,810
Yes! Yes!

284
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,660
We left it an old wreck!

285
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,490
I see.

286
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,480
Thus do I can consider that it does not belong to anybody?

287
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,490
What!?

288
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,430
Mayor!

289
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,110
We have to find a great quantity of treasures which could be saved

290
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,170
Very well.

291
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,300
The Navy all will confiscate them.

292
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,430
Stop!

293
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,960
I will not let to you touch with my treasures!

294
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,870
They are mine!

295
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,080
The treasures not having owners belong all to the World Government.

296
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,670
If you continue to act thus, you will be regarded as a pirate!

297
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,920
Ca is enough!

298
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,510
Before I was a pirate in any case.

299
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,760
I took all that I wanted by the force!

300
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,730
Take guard!

301
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,430
I now will have to act consequently of your acts.

302
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,620
I hope that does not disturb you, Pirate Whetton.

303
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,930
What!?

304
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,480
Would this be?

305
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,780
Summers you…?

306
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,950
Lapanui!

307
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,690
Not possible!

308
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,460
Hadn't I said you that we would return?

309
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,410
Isoka!

310
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,390
Stop Whetton and its gang!

311
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,240
Ok!

312
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,640
You all are in life the guy?

313
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,250
But how?

314
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,280
After the explosion we were propelled outside us too.

315
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,150
But it was in the world of 50 years ago.

316
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,270
As I thought it.

317
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,740
The Fog was able to modify the course of time completely.

318
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,300
Then, why didn't you say it earlier to me!?

319
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,080
To make fall Whetton with all the capacity which it had piled up, we needed a capacity even larger.

320
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,930
Yes, we needed the capacity of the Marines.

321
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,410
It is what we carried out.

322
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,130
But to obtain this capacity really took us much time.

323
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,950
I see.

324
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,410
But even if I carry this uniform of Navy,

325
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,280
Here and now, I am Pumpkin Pirate!

326
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,070
Henzo, your comrade.

327
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,920
Now and for always!

328
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,540
Lapanui…

329
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,710
And…

330
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,950
I forgot to specify that the pirates of Luffy are also in a state of arrest!

331
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,990
What!?

332
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,550
Species of monster without heart!

333
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,070
And in more I made you eat, morons!

334
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,600
The Navy swore to make owe them…

335
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,710
To make reign justice, and they will not accept that required people escape.

336
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,790
But…

337
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,420
What a brothel!

338
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,140
We must transport Whetton and his gang to the HQ of the Navy!

339
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,810
The Pirates of Luffy could escape right under our nose!

340
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,550
We are not numerous enough!

341
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,490
But during this time we can go to make a small round…

342
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,350
Ca could take one or two days before returning!

343
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,780
And if they are escaped during this time, one can nothing make there!

344
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,490
AH, I GIVE UP! I DONOT CAN WHAT MAKE!

345
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,450
You did it purposely…

346
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,650
Afflicted, we cannot repair it completely.

347
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,770
But these provisional repairs should avoid to him taking water.

348
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,680
I thank you, Luffy.

349
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,770
You and your companions.

350
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,870
Maintaining my years of research are finished.

351
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,120
One cannot say that.

352
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,220
One does not know when the Rainbow of the Fogs can return.

353
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,330
With this trick in the vicinity, one must always remain vigilant!

354
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,750
We need you to create something in order to counter the Rainbow of the Fogs.

355
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,550
I can do that.

356
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,710
The Rainbow of the Fogs is a lost Kingdom.

357
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,550
It has neither day, nor night.

358
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,600
And it, if it is not completely, is practically deprived of evil.

359
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,450
The sea gleams like emeralds.

360
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,220
The sky, easily confused with milk, wraps us deeply.

361
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,480
The unhappy ships which were victims of this kingdom there left an immense fortune.

362
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,630
It was really the last paradise on ground.

363
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,690
We were the kings of this Lost Kingdom.

364
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,610
As a combatant the pirates who wanted to invade it, we preserved the peace of this paradise.

365
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,380
We were Pumpkin Pirates!

366
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,180
I decided that our many adventures inside the Fog…

367
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,680
Beings had written here.

368
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,330
For the adventurers who will visit this Kingdom.

369
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,580
And these adventurers who guided us on the way of the return…

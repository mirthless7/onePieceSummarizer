1
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,739
You ace plus a radish.

2
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,679
And now…

3
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,970
You would not like to bet
your pants, frérot?

4
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,389
You ace of the vein, finally.

5
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,070
When one defies Roshio, it is necessary
to expect to be caught a beating.

6
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,070
Afflicted, my pal. I have you
plucked like a pigeon.

7
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,870
Drop.

8
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,870
It was an equitable part.

9
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,370
You cheated ace, hein?

10
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,770
Acknowledge!

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,770
How that?

12
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,899
When I would have…

13
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,170
Do not lie!

14
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,670
I know that cheated you.

15
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,770
Useless to try what
how it is, kid!

16
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,170
Sarquiss.

17
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,170
SARQUISS!

18
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,389
Hum?

19
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,330
What is there?

20
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,170
You ace well considering you too.

21
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,470
This guy cheated.

22
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,270
Cheated?

23
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,070
Oh!

24
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,889
Ouais!

25
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,570
Of course that he cheated.

26
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,640
I saw it my own eyes!

27
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Never considering a similar grugor!

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,140
CLOSE IT, BROTHEL!

29
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,740
YOU DO NOT KNOW HAS WHO YOU DEAL!

30
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:39,220
Stop dreaming!
Mock Town, the scorning city!

31
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,030
One arrives soon, Usopp?

32
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,330
Not, still not of ground at the horizon.

33
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,199
Jaya should not be any more
very far however, not?

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,230
Yes, time with the more stable air.

35
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,730
We are undoubtedly already
in the maritime zone of Jaya.

36
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,330
Then Jaya must be
a spring island.

37
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,130
It makes good, it is pleasant…

38
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,730
Which beautiful season that spring.

39
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,130
Even the gulls have the air happy.

40
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,010
THEY WERE CUT DOWN!

41
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,440
One will be able to be made yakitori!

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,989
They were cut down?

43
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,940
I did not hear shots.

44
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,160
Look at, a ball!

45
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,449
According to the direction towards
which they flew,

46
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,890
the balls come from
some share right in front of us!

47
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,990
But the island is still not in sight!

48
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,149
It is impossible, Chopper.

49
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,290
But I do not have them
left eyes however!

50
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,690
This type would have really the sharpened eye, a sophisticated ultra weapon and it would be a tireur d'élite of genius.

51
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,290
It had to draw randomly and these poor
gulls did not have a chance.

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,990
Sanji! Gulls, gulls!

53
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,300
The poor animals…

54
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,450
Ca must be painful…

55
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,180
… not to die on the blow.

56
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,480
Lastly, thus the destiny goes,
determined by our daily acts.

57
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,380
He, you!

58
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,580
You know who I am?!

59
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,380
How I would know it, cretin?!

60
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,920
Very well, I you will say it!

61
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,620
I am a champion of Wrestling!

62
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,019
Cool!

63
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,069
Ca with the sympathetic air like city!

64
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,829
It is me or one would say
a station balnéaire?!

65
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,099
Station balnéaire?!

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,589
More quickly, Merry!

67
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,499
It is true!

68
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,800
I want well to remain there
a little to release me.

69
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,800
Heu, on the other hand, it is me or all the ships
moored resemble pirate boats?

70
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, crowned Usopp!

71
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,400
As so pirate boats could throw
anchors it in a port to the eyes of everyone?

72
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,200
O… Yes, you are right!

73
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,109
THE HELP!! IT WILL KILL ME!

74
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,290
WHAT DOES NOT TURN
PAS ROND DANS CETTE VILLE?!

75
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,730
What a weakling!

76
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,379
He Ben!

77
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,180
Would have done you better
not to smash this type!

78
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,680
Look at this emblem!

79
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,680
It is one of the men of Roshio.

80
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,380
You never heard of Roshio,
the man to the 42 Million Berrys?

81
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,380
It is degenerate!

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,400
Pay to!

83
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,410
I do not believe in it.

84
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,910
There was not
cheating in this part.

85
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,410
But this guy has beautiful
and descended Roshio well.

86
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,470
You do not know who it is?

87
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,750
It is Bellamy!

88
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,050
He?! That of which the premium
rise to 55 Million Berrys…

89
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,720
Bellamy the Hyena?

90
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,160
Captain!

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,059
Who did that to you?

92
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,529
It does not matter, will find a doctor!

93
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,329
Quickly!

94
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,500
Captain, hold good!

95
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,299
Y' has animation by here.

96
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,650
This amusing city with the air.

97
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,690
They is not good.

98
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,440
One can be sure that these deux-là
troubles will create us!

99
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,060
Ouais, it is the perfect place for that. I do not see how the things could occur well…

100
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,259
You are right…

101
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,410
They are not good!

102
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,229
N-N-Nami
!

103
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,490
Wait! Luffy, Zoro!

104
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,600
It left.

105
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,759
All will be well if it
is with these deux-là.

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,299
What? If Nami-san there
goes, I accompany it!

107
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,409
AHH!!

108
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,110
NOT! REMAIN!

109
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,610
IF EVER THE BOAT EAST
A-A-ATTAQUE DURING YOUR ABSENCE…!

110
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,209
I You IN PRIIIIE, DO NOT LEAVE PAAAAS!

111
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,899
Ok, they is good!

112
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,710
Release maintaining me!

113
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,210
Well, I have only to do a little
tea for drinking in private conversation with…

114
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,269
Hein? Where is Robin-chan?

115
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,820
It is…

116
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,720
part.

117
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,819
Sanji-kun, of the tea?

118
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,920
Do it
yourself.

119
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,720
“As long as I would be in this
city, I swear not to slip by… “

120
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,520
“I swear not to beat me!”

121
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,920
“I swear not to beat me.”

122
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,249
Well. You swear it, both?

123
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:06,749
Ouais.

124
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,330
Ouais.

125
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,730
It is what this lack of enthusiasm?

126
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,460
You know, if you
sow the disorder here,

127
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,360
one will expel us out of this city!

128
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
And that, that would like to say
good-bye the celestial island, measuring rod?

129
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Eh…

130
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,060
Is Oh, it which that?

131
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,549
Look at. It fell.

132
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,960
Ouais. It fell stiff.

133
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,379
It with the air to suffer.

134
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,420
Ouaip, it suffers.

135
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,220
Hum, forgive me, Sirs.

136
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,079
Could you raise me?

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,020
You are sure of step better lengthened being?

138
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,609
Luffy, take this with dimensions.

139
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,259
Ok!

140
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,860
Hop!

141
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,160
Oh, thank you well.

142
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,360
Of return seals some.

143
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,760
I am of fragile constitution.

144
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,260
Go, on the way, Stronger.

145
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,260
THE HORSE TOO?!

146
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Whore, which parasite…

147
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,960
I am sorry
to cause such a gene.

148
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,849
I would like to reward you,
in pledge of my gratitude.

149
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,849
You want one of them?

150
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,819
Ca me with the air a little too equivocal.

151
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,479
One does not want any. Go, drops!

152
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,679
Oh! Apples! Thank you!

153
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,580
HE! HO!

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,319
It was what that?

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,819
What occurred?

156
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,659
They ate apples of the odd guy.

157
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,620
As soon as they bit inside,
they exploded all the five!

158
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,319
It is not true!

159
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,019
LUFFY!

160
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,819
RECRACHE CA!

161
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,819
RECRACHE THIS APPLE IMMEDIATELY!

162
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,319
Donot can, I already swallowed it!

163
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,120
Dumb, what
try to you to make?!

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,220
Not, it will be well.

165
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,929
I cannot believe it.

166
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,850
All is in ruin!

167
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,350
It was not charged. Without what,
he would have died in the first mouthful.

168
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,950
You are…

169
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,050
a lucky devil.

170
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,050
Is He… it what all that?

171
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,450
It is the last residence
of Roshio the Executor.

172
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,249
It would be said that there was
one crowned brawls here…

173
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,550
It does without things so much
terrible in this city…

174
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,310
Ouais, even witnesses of the scene
do not manage to believe what they saw!

175
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,110
All that one knows… it is that
Roshio fought with this Bellamy!

176
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,170
Bellamy the Hyena?

177
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,370
It has certainly
eaten a Fruit of the Demon.

178
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,250
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

179
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,800
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

180
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,650
In which town of nutcases
one still fell?!

181
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,550
Go, calms itself, Nami.

182
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,250
You realize that you came very close to death?

183
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,650
Ben, that arrives.

184
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,250
And they is cool, it is that?!

185
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,350
Here how that begins again to him!

186
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,450
Does Ca make how much victims already?

187
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,150
I ever heard of him,
there are no premiums on its head…

188
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,850
Where it leaves?

189
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,750
Bah, I do not even want the knowledge.

190
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,350
Better is worth to be held distant…

191
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,750
of this champion of Wrestling.

192
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,899
CHAMPION?

193
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,150
STOP! YOU PROMISED to Me!

194
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,960
I start to ask to me whether one will really finish
by finding information in this city!

195
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,430
What do you say of this corner?

196
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,830
Hum, it is not very animated.

197
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,530
Ca you can say it. This
place is splendid!

198
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,030
This city is true a cut-throat,
whereas here it is really the paradise.

199
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,230
There is a villa on the sea.

200
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,430
Y' does not have a rat on the other hand!

201
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,290
But that feels good food…

202
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,090
Oh, hello everyone!

203
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,890
You will attract each other troubles!

204
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,690
You would make better leave from here!

205
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,790
In this moment, the Tropical Hotel is entirely
occupied by the crew of Lord Bellamy!

206
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,870
This is why we are constrained
to refuse any other customer!

207
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,100
Oh, it is a hotel then…

208
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
If… if Bellamy-sama found you
here, it would be a catastrophe!

209
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,499
I thus regret of you
to ask to leave, please!

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,609
Oh go, one can nevertheless
to throw an eye inside.

211
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,310
And then it is which this Bellamy?

212
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,650
Does He, what occur?

213
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,409
Say to me from which leave these vermins?

214
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,889
SARQUISS-SAMA!

215
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,229
Be welcome!

216
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,129
You are healthy and except!

217
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,849
Nothing with foutre!
Insane them outside and quickly!

218
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,420
How much you believe that one pays you
to occupy you of this place?

219
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,829
It is true.

220
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,480
Go, breaks from there, p' tite shit.

221
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,189
He! I can smash the head to him?

222
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,180
NOT!

223
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,780
To smash me the head?

224
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,080
One fell on comic.

225
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,680
You really made pity the guy.

226
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,080
Hold!

227
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,480
Thus buy to you
correct behaviors with this money!

228
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,110
Sarquiss, you really waste
your tunes with similar good-for-nothings.

229
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,999
Undoubtedly I would have done better
to balance them in a ditch.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,080
Woa! It is for us?

231
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,830
One draws.

232
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,229
One ridicules oneself!

233
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,290
He, He, I can walk all alone!

234
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,530
Don't Ben what, you want any?

235
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,930
Sarquiss! Lily!
Release to them the bunch a little.

236
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,230
Oh, then you are you there.

237
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,030
It is not no matter who, looks at, they
are given evil to arrive up to now.

238
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,050
Hold!

239
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,250
But they are only microbes
compared with Bellamy or you.

240
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,709
Except that they manage
rather well for microbes.

241
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,230
Ouaip, but they will not hold a long time
with the arrival of the New Era.

242
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,109
But… 30 Million…

243
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,780
for this soft figure?

244
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
It is necessary that Bellamy sees that.

245
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,779
Brothel, I am in detonator!

246
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,910
Ah, I am sorry.

247
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,270
Mock Town became the paradise of the pirates
who spend their time running out their spoils.

248
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,000
The pitiful pirates are not
not welcome, not truth?

249
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,000
It would be said that I will not arrive
not to comfort you.

250
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,000
Hold! It is the house which offers it.

251
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,200
This city gathers
so much of rich people,

252
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,830
That brawls and them
murders are currency.

253
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,230
But they are not caught any almost
never with people of the city.

254
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,330
Here.

255
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,430
It is nevertheless a dirty place.

256
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,070
You know, I you
include/understand completely.

257
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,669
Afflicted to say that, but you will not find
no normal people in this city.

258
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,370
Bah, your Log will be reloaded
within four surroundings days.

259
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,970
You quiet by then hold, and raise
anchors it before having troubles, of agreement?

260
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,220
Four days.

261
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,030
Then only we are not needed
remained more than two days.

262
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,179
Forgiveness, but…

263
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,629
HE, PAPI!

264
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,030
Hmm? That there
does it have?

265
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,930
- This tart with cherries is REPUGNANT!
- This tart with cherries is DELICIOUS!

266
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,040
- It is what this PISS OF CAT?!
- This drink is EXELLENTE!

267
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,840
Dumb, your papillae
gustatory talk cock?

268
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,640
And, it is to you the brain, not?

269
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,360
He Ho, if you have reproaches
to make, you address to the cook.

270
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,060
He, papi! Put to me 50
pieces of meat to be carried.

271
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,660
Grandfather, I want 51
tarts with cherries to be carried.

272
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,669
I wanted to say 52 pieces!

273
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,660
One minute, I wanted 53 tarts.

274
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,269
Not, 54 meat ends!

275
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,469
55 tarts.

276
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,469
60 meat ends!

277
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,469
70 tarts!

278
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,169
80!

279
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,160
100!

280
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,969
YOU SEEK ME OR WHAT?!

281
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,260
CA RHYME HAS WHAT THIS BRAWL?!

282
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,960
Isn't Luffy, you promised?

283
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,769
In any event, we do not have
not enough of money for that!

284
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,960
One did not come to make the races!

285
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,860
Be to you a pirate?

286
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,760
Ouais, exact!

287
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,560
With how much does rise your premium?

288
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,660
30 Million!

289
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,710
30 Million?

290
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,010
You?

291
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,010
Te insane step of me?!

292
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,889
YOU LIE!

293
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,019
NOT! It IS the TRUTH!

294
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,810
Ca is enough!

295
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,150
The calm one! I do not want
brawls in my bar!

296
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,150
Take-that and insane the camp!

297
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,580
50 tarts with cherries.

298
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,300
Y' has it a pirate with
a straw hat here?

299
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,720
C… It is Bellamy!

300
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,300
Then it is you which am worth 30 Million
Berrys? Luffy with the Straw hat…

301
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,300
Hein?

302
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,700
It would be said that it is with
you that it causes, Luffy.

303
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,900
He, Bellamy, it is not the name of the type which
all the hotel where one held went?

304
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,800
You ace heard that? This kid
a premium of 30 Million would have!

305
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,100
He? Be sure for you?

306
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,500
I meet full
asparaguses today.

307
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,909
Give me your the best
twist-bowels, tavernier!

308
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,400
And serve what he wants with this kid!

309
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,640
Very well.

310
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,730
Hold. Y' has really world here.

311
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,330
It is what this hole with
rats? They is crasseux!

312
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,260
And one must be useful that bibine here.

313
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,460
Look at, they are them
guy of presently.

314
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,240
You could at least us
to release some seats.

315
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,340
What a wild!

316
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,400
It, isn't this is him?

317
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,240
It is Big Knife Sarquiss.

318
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,549
Does Ca feel the brawl, you do not believe?

319
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,570
Really?

320
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,000
The crew is complete.

321
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,330
If that is, they have
simply desire of glass, not?

322
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,770
Useless to interfere itself! Better
is worth to remain apart from that.

323
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,770
Bellamy is incorrigible.

324
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,270
You said it.

325
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,690
With holds.

326
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Oh, thank you.

327
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,330
Be really sympathetic for you, you.

328
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
Ca is there!

329
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,770
I did not expect that, Bellamy!

330
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,150
With what you cheeks, sailor?

331
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,360
It is rather with you of
to answer this question.

332
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,620
Zoro! Stop that!

333
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,329
There is none yet
information for the moment!

334
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,070
The farm!

335
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,070
This guy seeks the brawl
and I will give it to him!

336
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,390
Be able to you to be raised?

337
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,140
Ok, then…

338
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,280
I hope that are ready for you.

339
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh! They have the intention
to defy Bellamy!

340
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,080
Go! It left!

341
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,450
Ca will not be a brawl,
it will be right a test!

342
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,410
Go ahead! Show it
that you can make!

343
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,910
Luffy, wait!

344
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,910
Tavernier, we seek
information on the celestial island!

345
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,420
You know something?

346
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,090
What is this… that it has just said?

347
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,050
It is a joke, not true?

348
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,900
If ever you know
road towards the celestial island…

349
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,420
The celestial island?!

350
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
It is quite good!

351
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,220
Hein? But the Log Installation is
pointed right towards the sky!

352
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,530
Oh nooon, the Log Installation is
pointed towards the cieeeel!

353
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,770
The Log Installations talk cock
all the time, you know!

354
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,540
Let us go, go, of the calm one.

355
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,140
You really believe in this history to sleep
upright which speaks about an island in the sky?

356
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,900
The guy, in which
time do you live?

357
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,760
There is a whole heap of phenomena
strange on Large Line.

358
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,200
One of them carries it
name of “Knock Up Stream”.

359
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,300
I suppose that you in
ever intended to speak.

360
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,649
The ships which are
trapped in this current…

361
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,340
Are propelled high in the sky, for
finally to fall down and be crushed on the ocean.

362
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,840
Formerly, of the sailors ignoramuses saw these boats falling from the sky, and they believed that there was an island up there.

363
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,740
“A floating world in the skies!”

364
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,440
What cretins!

365
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,040
All these phenomena have
a rational explanation!

366
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,740
All the dreams can be explained!

367
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,640
I am disappointed.

368
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,740
If had made a success of you the test, I thought of enlisting you
in my crew to sail about the New Era.

369
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,940
But you are not worth the sorrow of it.

370
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,140
Listen well!

371
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,640
The time when pirates
dreams had is COMPLETED!

372
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,519
The Gold City? The Emerald City?

373
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,200
The large treasure, One Part?!

374
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,479
These idiots who dream
fabulous treasures…

375
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,370
all do not even notice
the richnesses which surround them!

376
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,870
All the largest pirates of the seas are
died by continuing this kind of dreams!

377
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,300
And what them
do people end up saying?

378
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,230
“He lived happy in
continuing its dreams! “

379
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,630
What a rengaine losers!

380
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,739
To look at a cretin of
dreamer in your kind…

381
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,730
Ca returns to me sick!

382
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,080
Luffy!

383
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:07,920
It is because of mops in your kind that
reputation of pirate truths as we is tarnished.

384
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,710
Bar you, band of larvae!

385
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,169
You waste the taste of my rum.

386
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,820
Bellamy rightly!

387
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,670
You draw, stunned!

388
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,410
You break this city!

389
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,310
Bellamy!

390
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,240
It would be said that they want spectacle!

391
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,380
They will not be disappointed.

392
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,830
Luffy! Zoro! One
forget this promise!

393
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,560
You can put one
beating with these types!

394
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,400
Zoro.

395
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,740
We will not beat we.

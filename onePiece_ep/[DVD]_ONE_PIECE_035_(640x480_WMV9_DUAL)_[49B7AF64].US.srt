1
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:51,711
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

2
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,378
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

3
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,087
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

4
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:53,421
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

5
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:54,005
There's no way Nami would kill Usopp!

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,799
We're friends!

7
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,292
Who's friends, Luffy?

8
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,095
Don't make me laugh.

9
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,973
You're more like a pathetic group of cooperators.

10
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,008
I see...

11
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,808
Of course she'd be upset.

12
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,695
Somebody actually came for her.

13
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:21,983
Friends, huh?

14
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,083
To her...

15
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,183
That's the most...

16
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,657
...difficult word of all.

17
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,747
Nami bluffed the ''killing me
off'' part so I could escape.

18
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:40,510
I think there's a reason for her
being with the mermen pirates.

19
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,330
Do us a favor. Don't meddle with this village's
affairs anymore than you already have.

20
00:02:44,472 --> 00:02:45,723
Leave Nami alone.

21
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,435
I'll tell you everything there is to know.

22
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,835
I'll pass.

23
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,835
H-Hey!

24
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,764
I'm not interested in her past

25
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,349
Where are you going? Luffy?!

26
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,108
A walk.

27
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,408
Who's he..?

28
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:06,077
THE HIDDEN PAST!
FEMALE FIGHTER BELLEMERE!

29
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:11,849
I was surprised...

30
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:16,788
To have someone report seeing a ship falling
from the sky, and it turning out to be true.

31
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:21,426
Looks like some abnormal human
has landed on this island.

32
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,845
Who exactly and for what purpose?

33
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,265
Look! That guy over there!

34
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,868
He's not someone from this island!

35
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,159
What?

36
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:39,903
So those are mermen?

37
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:06,888
Hey! Wait! Y-You!

38
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,340
Huh? Were you calling me?

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,201
Y-You... who are you?

40
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,094
What are you doing on this island?

41
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,846
What does it matter to you?

42
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,999
W-Well, you've got a point there...

43
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:19,484
Just like you said.

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,152
I'm Luffy.

45
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,037
I'm taking a walk.

46
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,156
''Taking a walk?''

47
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,076
Have a pleasant one!

48
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,824
Smartass, where are you headed?

49
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,832
How should I know?

50
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,419
Isn't he kind of amusing?

51
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:40,755
Just who is he?

52
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,591
He wasn't intimidated by us at all.

53
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,044
A rather mysterious character.

54
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,308
Bellemere?

55
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,978
Did that woman raise both, you and Nami?

56
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,579
Yes, that's right.

57
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:58,982
Where shall I begin?

58
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:01,934
Bellemere-san's story...

59
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,493
I dozed off...

60
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:11,494
Eh?

61
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,204
Nojiko?

62
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,658
Where could she have gone?

63
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,465
Just a bit more, Bellemere-san.

64
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:23,756
Just a bit more, Bellemere-san.

65
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:24,257
Just a bit more, Bellemere-san.

66
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,425
Just a bit more, Bellemere-san.

67
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,263
Just a bit more and we'll get everything back!

68
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:34,809
Cocoyashi Village, the orange
farm and my dream too!

69
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,819
l've endured for 8 years.

70
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,675
It's done!

71
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,875
IT'S DONE!!

72
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,186
Now if I could only take a look at that book.

73
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:21,699
Oh,

74
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:23,099
Na-chan!

75
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,784
What's the matter?

76
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:29,030
Nothing! Nothing at all!

77
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,275
HEY! NAMI!

78
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,375
NOT AGAIN!!

79
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,675
Ah, Nami again? Let me go!

80
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,384
Ah, Nami again? Let me go!

81
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:49,801
Ah, Nami again? Let me go!

82
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,210
No helping it, eh?

83
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,944
I'm not some cat!

84
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,097
Baka! How many times do I have
to tell you not to steal things?!

85
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:55,723
Baka! How many times do I have
to tell you not to steal things?!

86
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:56,599
Baka! How many times do I have
to tell you not to steal things?!

87
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,225
Baka! How many times do I have
to tell you not to steal things?!

88
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:57,675
Baka! How many times do I have
to tell you not to steal things?!

89
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,104
That's because we're poor at
my house! I can't help it!

90
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:01,679
That's because we're poor at
my house! I can't help it!

91
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:03,679
Stingy!

92
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,167
Bellemere!

93
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:07,610
Bellemere! Your stray cat has done it again!

94
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,989
Bellemere! Your stray cat has done it again!

95
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:11,056
Bellemere! Your stray cat has done it again!

96
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,452
What? Aren't you the noisy one...

97
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:16,686
What? Aren't you the noisy one...

98
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,456
Oh, welcome back Nami!

99
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:20,656
I'm home!

100
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,451
Look! How many times is this now?

101
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,086
The whole town's talking about her!

102
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:25,503
The whole town's talking about her!

103
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:28,003
So what?

104
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,010
You don't have to get so worked
up over it Gen-san. Right?

105
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,095
It's because you're too relaxed about it!!

106
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,221
Just kidding... I understand.

107
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,681
Just kidding... I understand.

108
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,476
Gen-san has paid for it, right?

109
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:40,576
Bellemere...

110
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,913
Thanks. I don't have any money right now.

111
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:45,388
I'll repay you next time...

112
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:48,685
with my b-o-d-y...

113
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,381
D-Don't say such a thing!

114
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,442
He turned all red, too!

115
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,709
Oh... why are you laughing?

116
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,298
If you do this again, your butt's gonna get it!

117
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:11,633
I'm sorry!

118
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,345
But I needed this book, no matter what!

119
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,932
If you wanted it, why didn't you ask me?

120
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,302
You wouldn't have bought it anyway...

121
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,939
I would've! We've got some money
from our last harvest.

122
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,107
But the people from the village were saying,

123
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:27,440
But the people from the village were saying,

124
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,024
But the people from the village were saying,

125
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:28,066
But the people from the village were saying,

126
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:32,403
''The weather's been really good recently, so all
the orange farms should be producing well.''

127
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:36,065
So, our oranges won't rise
in price or won't sell at all.

128
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:37,492
You're thinking too much.

129
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:39,911
Nami sure is clumsy!

130
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,289
If it was me, I would've stolen it perfectly!

131
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,709
Don't go stealing things!

132
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,671
I was just kidding! Really I was!

133
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,798
That hurt!

134
00:08:56,052 --> 00:09:01,558
But at least this is something to brag about...
Nami's maps are really amazing!

135
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:05,895
After learning how to make sea maps, I see
that you've also learnt to do the land.

136
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,624
This... this is a map of this island, right?

137
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:14,946
No one would believe that such
a small child made this.

138
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:19,868
I'm studying navigation right now!

139
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,744
Navigation too?

140
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:23,830
It's Nami's dream, right?

141
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:29,502
I'm going to sail around the world
using my navigation skills!

142
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:33,673
And then, I'll make a world map
of all the places I've seen!

143
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:39,429
So, this first Island map will mark the
first step to your dream, right?

144
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,808
World map, eh?

145
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,821
Nami, I'm sure that your dream
will come true someday!

146
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,101
Definitely!

147
00:09:58,782 --> 00:09:59,073
Hey, Bellemere-san.

148
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,283
Hey, Bellemere-san.

149
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:02,577
Why haven't you been eating lately?

150
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:02,869
Why haven't you been eating lately?

151
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,203
Why haven't you been eating lately?

152
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:03,486
Why haven't you been eating lately?

153
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,321
I'm eating oranges, aren't I?

154
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,373
I'm on a diet right now.

155
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,459
Then I don't want to eat either.

156
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,544
What's all this drama?

157
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,630
Kids have to eat well.

158
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,230
You're just lying!

159
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:19,435
It's because we don't have any money, that's
why Bellemere-san isn't eating, right?

160
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:20,261
Really?

161
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:22,222
You're enduring it by yourself, while giving us...

162
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:22,889
It's a DIET!
You're enduring it by yourself, while giving us...

163
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,408
It's a DIET!
You're enduring it by yourself, while giving us...

164
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:27,268
Now you two, you shouldn't underestimate
the beautifying powers of these oranges.

165
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:33,108
Even though I'm 30, this radiant
skin is all thanks to my oranges.

166
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:34,943
But your hands are yellow.

167
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,070
Shut up and eat!

168
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,824
Alright Nami, it's done!

169
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,660
The Bellemere-brand haute couture.

170
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,453
Another one of Nojiko's hand-me-downs...

171
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:46,079
Yeah yeah, but it suits you Nami!

172
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,665
Yeah yeah, but it suits you Nami!

173
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,334
This lion was a sunflower before!

174
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,211
Well, of course, Nami!

175
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,047
You're 2 years younger than me.

176
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,091
Age shouldn't matter!

177
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,301
I want new clothes too!

178
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,303
But mine are used too you know!

179
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:05,256
Since you're my younger sister, that's
why you get my used clothes.

180
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,726
But I'm not your real sister!

181
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,229
We're not of the same blood!

182
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:12,929
NAMI!

183
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,742
Bellemere-san?

184
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,442
What's that rubbish about not
having the same blood?!

185
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,306
That doesn't matter!

186
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,032
I don't ever want to hear that again!

187
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,510
So what...

188
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:46,598
Bellemere-san isn't our real mother either!

189
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,643
Wouldn't it be better if we weren't here?

190
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:56,941
Then you could actually eat! Buy the
clothes you like, and live carefree!

191
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:03,072
If I was gonna be taken care of, then
it should've been by a rich family!

192
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,115
R-Really?

193
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,035
Then do whatever you want.

194
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:20,123
If you really hate this house so much,
go and get lost wherever you want!

195
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,323
Stop it you two!

196
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:24,293
I'M LEAVING!

197
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:26,471
Nami!

198
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:28,473
NAMI!!

199
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:39,334
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

200
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,216
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

201
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:01,506
Bellemere-san...

202
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,926
The three of us are a family!

203
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,178
Nami thinks so too!

204
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,389
Just now... she was just...

205
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,689
You're the levelheaded one, Nojiko.

206
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,408
I wasn't very adult-like just now, was I?

207
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:23,294
Can you fetch Nami back?

208
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:26,706
I'll wait for you two while making
some delicious food.

209
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,591
So Ma'am, how about this much?

210
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,235
Eh? Can't you make it any lower?

211
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,263
Over here! Cheap! Cheap!

212
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,643
You won't find a better price for these,
no matter where you look!

213
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:07,126
So, coming from the outskirts into the
village is called leaving home, Eh?

214
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,339
How nice and simple!

215
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,135
Here, before it cools down.

216
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,958
Bellemere-san would be happier
if we weren't around.

217
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,085
Why do you think so?

218
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,972
If you have two kids, you need more money.

219
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:28,610
And because of me, the people
of the village hate her.

220
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:32,588
So you're old enough to be
worrying about others, eh?

221
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:39,005
Rest assured. When she was your
age, she was a nightmare.

222
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,622
Bellemere-san was?

223
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:44,717
From the villager's point of view, she's
still pretty much a naughty kid.

224
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:50,732
When that naughty kid wanted to join the
marines, the villagers were astounded.

225
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:51,958
The marines?

226
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,235
Bellemere-san was a marine?

227
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:08,166
''Pirates who kill innocent people are unforgivable.''

228
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:11,118
Saying that, she left the village.

229
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,230
She was on the verge of dying when...

230
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,359
Well... this is alright...

231
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:46,929
Your younger sister?

232
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,295
No, just a little stranger.

233
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,432
She doesn't know a thing...

234
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,833
That was you, Nami.

235
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,664
After seeing you, it was like Bellemere
regained her reason to live.

236
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:42,727
It is a ship! It's coming in!

237
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:45,763
In this terrible storm... Who
in the world could it be?!

238
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:55,573
Doctor!

239
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,200
Call the doctor!

240
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,286
Bellemere? Isn't it Bellemere?!

241
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,248
Bellemere, what exactly happened here?

242
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:07,710
These kids...

243
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:08,419
Doctor!

244
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:09,838
They've got a high fever!

245
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,132
They've grown much weaker due to the storm!

246
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,966
What?

247
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,430
Alright, you'd better treat those
horrible wounds as well...

248
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,099
Never mind me, HURRY!

249
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,593
Please don't let them die!

250
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,812
Just save those two kids!

251
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:29,607
PLEASE!

252
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:36,022
What did you just say, you little thug?!

253
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:40,193
''I'm going to be a parent to
these kids,'' is what I said.

254
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,411
Impossible!

255
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:42,787
Give it up!

256
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:45,957
A bad girl like you can't raise kids!

257
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,711
We won't say anything, so just let
the government handle them...

258
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:51,421
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND!!

259
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,599
I too, am an adult now.

260
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,167
I've already been a marine,

261
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,503
and I want to try to be a good
and responsible person.

262
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,906
I'll take responsibility for these two and raise them.

263
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:07,128
In order to survive in this era, I'm going
to raise them into fine people!

264
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,356
I want to live with them.

265
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:13,726
Nami and Nojiko have given me a new breath of life.

266
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:23,671
You guys have a stronger bond than
a real parent and child would have.

267
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:30,168
Nami! So you were here all along.

268
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:31,668
Nojiko...

269
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,205
Bellemere-san's waiting for you,

270
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,733
with a delicious dinner prepared!

271
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:44,023
It's most likely Nami's favorite
egg-rice with orange dressing!

272
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,073
Yata!

273
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,578
~Egg~ and ~rice~

274
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,516
Time sure flies.

275
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:58,037
Those little ones who once struggled
to survive have grown so much.

276
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,826
Everyone enjoys watching them happily growing up.

277
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:09,582
If those three weren't happy, we couldn't
forgive ourselves, could we?

278
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:21,411
PIRATES! EVERYONE!!

279
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:24,222
PIRATES HAVE COME!

280
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:28,852
PIRATES! EVERYONE HIDE!

281
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,737
The Arlong Pirates!

282
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:40,737
Arlong?

283
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:41,489
No way!

284
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,826
Why would mermen from the Grand
Line come all the way here?

285
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:48,237
So the rumor about mermen pirates splitting up was true?

286
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:49,622
Nami! Nojiko!

287
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,822
Gen-san!

288
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,117
It's dangerous here.

289
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:54,882
Go and hide in the forest behind the village.

290
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,452
But...

291
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:57,952
Hurry and go!

292
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:12,479
Greetings and salutations, my little inferior humans!

293
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:15,164
From this moment on, this village...

294
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,917
No, this whole island will be part of my domain!

295
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,404
Listen carefully.

296
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,840
On this day of every month,

297
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,329
You'll have to ''purchase'' your very lives from me!

298
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,455
Each adult for 100,000 beli.

299
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:32,865
Each kid for 50,000 beli.

300
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,130
Those who can't pay will be killed!

301
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,172
What should we do, Nojiko?

302
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:42,291
We can't pay that much money!

303
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,919
But maybe they won't find our house.

304
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:46,813
Because, it can't be seen from the village.

305
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,854
How much is it, my brethren?

306
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,482
About 25 million or so.

307
00:20:58,326 --> 00:20:59,609
Perfect!

308
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:08,885
From now on, each of us will have to pay 100,000
beli every month for our own souls?

309
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:11,913
100,000? We can't afford to survive!

310
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,013
We can only endure.

311
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:16,409
At least no one in the village will get killed.

312
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,972
If we can solve this just with
money, it's a fair bargain.

313
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,324
I hope they leave as they are,

314
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:26,469
without noticing Bellemere's house.

315
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:30,698
Including her two kids, it'll be 200,000 beli...

316
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:33,393
She can't possibly have that much.

317
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:35,395
Alright!

318
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,604
We're leaving,

319
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,097
my brethren!

320
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,629
Arlong-san, there's smoke from
somewhere outside the village!

321
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:51,837
Okay,

322
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,637
let's see now...

323
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:55,782
Mmmm! Too tasty!

324
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:58,062
Truly a Bellemere orange sauce original!

325
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:00,336
Nami and Nojiko will get a kick out of this!

326
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:03,927
That's smoke coming from a house!

327
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:07,927
Almost missed one.

328
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:09,227
Shit..!

329
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:10,763
Bellemere-san!

330
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,841
Let's go and collect our money!

331
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,162
This is bad! The pirates are...

332
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:20,223
...going to Bellemere's house!

333
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,646
Hey! Nojiko and Nami aren't here!

334
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:27,655
What did you say?

335
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,608
The duck in the oven needs another 10 minutes.

336
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,076
Stew's about ready too.

337
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,387
This is going to hit the budget pretty hard.

338
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,490
Oh well, let's just enjoy the moment.

339
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,215
Bellemere-san will...

340
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:46,674
Bellemere-san will!!

341
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,963
Bellemere-san will be killed!!

1
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:02,320
Today the great performance!

2
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:02,320
Basket Basket Assembly!

3
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,120
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,770
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,880
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,530
Those which try to stop the battle.

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,650
Those which try to prolong the battle.

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,100
These two camps are gathered in Alubarna!

9
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,120
Now, Usopp and Chopper fight against…

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,260
Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas in a keen fight.

11
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,840
Will Arabasta fall in ruin?

12
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,740
Or will it reach a durable peace?

13
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,810
God of the destiny counts the seconds before the end.

14
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,800
DO NOT TELL ANYTHING, OLD CRONE!

15
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,900
IT…

16
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,890
… CANNOT HAVE DIED!

17
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,570
IT CANNOT HAVE BEEN MADE BEAT BY CROCODILE!

18
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,220
Did Ah ouais? And why couldn't it?

19
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,900
Because it must become the Lord of the Pirates!

20
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,380
It cannot die in this desert like that!

21
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,500
S- Lord of the Pirates!?

22
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,850
Lord of the Pirates!

23
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,560
The lord of Worst the Rats!

24
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,680
It is too good, that one!

25
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,950
How if a vulgar kid could claim to become the Lord of the Pirates!

26
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,370
Mr. 0 made well kill it, this small presumptuous!

27
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:55,860
A Ba of less!

28
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,630
What a Ba!

29
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,080
LISTEN WELL, CHOPPER!

30
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,980
A man…

31
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,010
It is time to finish some, Long Conk!

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,190
must sometimes…

33
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,360
same if… I it is about to die…

34
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,190
to face the wild enemies…

35
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,830
Right in hell goes!

36
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,970
Usopp!

37
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,910
Same if…

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,170
it knows… that it does not have any chance…

39
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,840
Mr. 4!

40
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,620
There stop remaining to laugh like an idiot!

41
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,240
You put in position!

42
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,160
4 Your Beats!

43
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,260
One arrives!

44
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,990
USOPP!!

45
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,590
It does not matter what the weak ones do, with final they remain weak!

46
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,720
Look at it!

47
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,340
REFUSE!

48
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,310
You…!

49
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,900
Hein? You want a piece of it?

50
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,070
Be useful yourself.

51
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,470
We will flee with far us planquer like this coward from Long Conk!

52
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,930
CLOSE it!

53
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
Usopp…

54
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,990
Usopp is not a coward!

55
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,320
There are times…

56
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,740
… where a man cannot…

57
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,160
… to move back in front of the combat.

58
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,730
Quoââ?!

59
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,580
You are still…!

60
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,530
This moment is when his/her companion…

61
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,300
when one makes fun of the dream…

62
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,670
… of my friend!

63
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,130
Impossible…

64
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,950
Mr. 4 broke cranium with his beater to him!

65
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,350
He cannot be in life after that!

66
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,660
He should be dead!
How it could be raised?!

67
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,250
It is still one of its small rounds?

68
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,470
Luffy did not die.

69
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,440
I know that he will become the Lord of the Pirates…

70
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,290
And it will become it!!

71
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,990
And…

72
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,640
AND I WILL NOT LET ANYBODY SE MAKE FUN OF HIM!

73
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,720
I believe that it did not have its account…

74
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,940
One gives that, Mr. 4!

75
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,070
Not so quickly! I will not let to you make!

76
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,150
Now, you will see…
my special point of transformation!

77
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,510
USOPP!!

78
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,650
It does not matter the force of your will…

79
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,400
this time, one does not go you louper!

80
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,340
CH CHOPPER!

81
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,750
Place… you behind me!

82
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,840
Hold good!

83
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,240
You are ready with batter, Mr. 4!?

84
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,790
Eat that.

85
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,260
They… are with you, Chopper!

86
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,910
Well!

87
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,730
This dirtiness left its shoes to flee!

88
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,910
QU WHAT!?

89
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,370
Not, Mr. 4!

90
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,350
It is me!

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,700
He!

92
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,000
He the ugly one, looks at what I have for you!

93
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
One succeeded…

94
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,900
Usopp!

95
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,850
Usopp!

96
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,780
Go, rises!

97
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,130
Do not die!!

98
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,880
That somebody calls a doctor!

99
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,360
Hein?

100
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,140
A DOCTEUUURRRRRR!!

101
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,600
It is you!

102
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,210
Hein?

103
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,820
Does Ca go?

104
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,740
O- Yes…

105
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,540
Kohza!

106
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
You are well?

107
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,720
Yes.

108
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,820
Is this the ball of Nanohana which does you always badly…?

109
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,120
It is a battle field, here.

110
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,270
Do not occupy you of that!

111
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,230
Most important…

112
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,580
I need a horse.

113
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,100
If I can overlap from here in the middle of the city,

114
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,350
I will be able to go to the palate in the Northern district!

115
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,530
The palate?

116
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,180
What do you want to make there?

117
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,190
I will summon Cobra to capitulate.

118
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,540
Do not do that!

119
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,710
There are Chaka and Pell which order the troops over there in the districts North!

120
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,860
They is too dangerous!

121
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,370
Our manpower are not complete!

122
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,130
The reinforcements coming from the other camps are not yet there!

123
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,630
Let us wait, they are too dangerous for them to only act!

124
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,570
It is already too late.

125
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,490
Cover me!

126
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
He, Kohza!

127
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,420
Halt!

128
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,510
A rebel?

129
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,580
This street leads to the palate, the access is prohibited there!

130
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,960
You heard me?

131
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,630
All the citizens were evacuated!
You must leave the city!

132
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,590
He, you us listenings, young girl?

133
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,800
It is not a cour de recreation, here!

134
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,320
I know well!

135
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,730
Princess Vivi…

136
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,120
Vivi-Sama?

137
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,100
Is this Vivi-Sama?

138
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,690
Where is my father in this moment?

139
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,230
E-Eh well…

140
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,740
In this case…

141
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,170
Bring me at Chaka!

142
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,700
I need him to do something!

143
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,500
The dumb…!

144
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,650
What a kick…!

145
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,520
How can it hold head with my Kenpo Ballet?

146
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,250
Bouuuuge out of my cheeemin!

147
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,390
You will have initially… to pass to me on the body!

148
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,580
Eh well, if you really want it, my cabbage…

149
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,610
Each day, each day!

150
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,260
Lesson! Lesson!

151
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,510
You are not size vis-a-vis my Dancer Kenpo!

152
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,800
To try to avoid my fists will change nothing there!

153
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,620
This combat does not bring anything to me…

154
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,900
I will finish some with a kick!

155
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,120
This dumb…

156
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,600
He stopped my Shot Sheep…

157
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,810
The blow of this cook…

158
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,970
cannot equalize my Swan Arabesque…

159
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,770
Thus cease having fun!

160
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,930
Enough, now I will have it!

161
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,970
I am serious!

162
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,510
Henceforth, I am serious!

163
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,050
Show me that.

164
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,800
You!

165
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,590
You still will test my capacities!

166
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,170
And nothing is more impressive than my storage capacity!

167
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,420
To employ that, for example.

168
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,250
I can create an assembly like this!

169
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,410
Once you will have seen this, you will have completely died of laughing!

170
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,920
Initially, the strangest head of the world!

171
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,930
Then, eyes more mild nutters!

172
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,260
Strangest of the noses!

173
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,050
The strangest possible mouth!

174
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,700
Now, for your visual pleasure…

175
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,260
Great Execution Today!

176
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,040
90% of this face are the tien…

177
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,570
Release from there.

178
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,840
It is not a play, dumb!

179
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,520
What? You do not have blood or tears!?

180
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,550
DEMON!

181
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,830
I do not have time for your small performances.

182
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,690
Performances?

183
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,720
Nothing!

184
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,280
My performances are nothing!!

185
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,020
Once, a long ago, I met a man.

186
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,760
And the friendship remained my way of harming to him!

187
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,460
I see.

188
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,530
“This man in front of me…”

189
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,540
I believe that I have an idea…

190
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,510
“… is a person!”

191
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,840
“I think that I am in love!”

192
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,090
“I realized…”

193
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,680
“You need me!”

194
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,920
… of what I must do.

195
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,030
Now, I would like to see you striking one…

196
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,670
Q- What is there!?

197
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,550
It is the face of your friend, not?

198
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,860
You would do that with your friend!?

199
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,110
It is sure that are stupid for you.

200
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,730
It does not matter with which you resemble,
it is always you of below.

201
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,530
I am not this kind of the type which falls into the panel because of surface images like that.

202
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,690
People…

203
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,770
… have a heart!

204
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,740
People… have a heart…

205
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,020
It is if…

206
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,140
PURE!

207
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,400
I have if shame to take this form…

208
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:55,820
I include/understand.

209
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,580
Even if I…

210
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,310
… changed me into it.

211
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,410
Mellorine! Mellorine!

212
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,570
It does not matter which of your friends I choose…

213
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,550
Mellorine! Mellorine!

214
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,530
… that will not have any effect.

215
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,040
Mellorine! Mellorine!

216
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,400
Too much easy.

217
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,980
Mellorine! Mello…

218
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,540
I cannot believe that it either so easy.

219
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,930
Mellorine! Mello…

220
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,380
Really so easy?

221
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,360
Moron.

222
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,200
It is Vivi-Sama!

223
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:30,600
What?

224
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,360
It is true!

225
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,980
Is the Princess of return?

226
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,670
Why is it here in a similar moment!?

227
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,900
Ah, really…

228
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,340
You have all your spirit, Vivi-Sama?

229
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,690
If we do that…

230
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,190
If we do that, what?

231
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,310
This country will die?

232
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,880
I do not think.

233
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,830
It is not Arabasta.

234
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,280
The kingdom of Arabasta…

235
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,720
...com carries all those which suffer in this moment!

236
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,970
If they are alive, Arabasta will be always a country!

237
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,210
The battle must cease, it is all that imports!

238
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,620
Please!

239
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,370
If I can draw their attention…

240
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,340
even for a few moments…

241
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,690
I will be able to do something.

242
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,710
I know that I can do something!

243
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,170
This palate…

244
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,280
Destroy it!

245
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,090
Q- What…

246
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,900
What do you say?

247
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,520
Princess, the palate represents 4.000 years of history!

248
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,170
Do not be insane, Vivi-Sama!

249
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,890
Chaka-Sama!

250
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,760
I rely on you, but…

251
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,260
the King is absent!

252
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,580
He would never allow such an egoistic act!

253
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,980
But, your Highness…

254
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,810
With this pace, the existence even of the kingdom will be in danger!

255
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,560
And then?

256
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,770
Want you to destroy all the people…

257
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,260
… without knowing the cause of all that?

258
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,530
It is what will destroy the country.

259
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,870
We will take the offensive.

260
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,040
Crocodile is in Rainbase.

261
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,300
With all my respect.

262
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,710
If one attacks Crocodile now,

263
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,570
it will be like putting oil on the fire of the rebellion!

264
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,800
While we attack Rainbase,

265
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,580
the rebellious army will seize the occasion to strike and occupy the palate!

266
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,880
And one does what if the palate falls to the hands from the rebellious army?

267
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,170
Even if the royal army were to be destroyed, in five years or more,

268
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,580
the country will recover.

269
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,110
We are not those which must be protected!

270
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,910
They are the people of this country!

271
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,350
Never forget it.

272
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,100
A country…

273
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,350
… is its inhabitants.

274
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,840
Vivi-Sama…

275
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,280
With your orders!

1
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,000
Operation Disembarkation Commences! 
The Straw Hat Crew Rushes In!

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,000
One Piece Treasure Sweepstakes! The first letter is...

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,290
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,540
It's alright...

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,250
Robin, you'll be okay...

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,100
You're still hiding something, right?

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,570
I don't care, it's okay...

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
But pirates...

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,390
They can't leave their crew,

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,220
without the captain's permission.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,700
That's why...

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,260
You should...

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,880
Have faith in Luffy!

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,580
FROG!!

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,630
You...

16
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,330
Since that day 8 years ago when Tom-san was taken away...

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,260
Everyday you would try to fight the sea train.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,270
So that you wouldn't lose the people you loved again.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,230
So that you could protect the people you loved this time.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,750
Yokozuna!

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,470
The time to show the results of your training is now!

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,170
Anyway...

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,420
Now the government has me, who holds the plan of the weapon.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,700
And you, who can awaken all of the existing weapons.

25
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,090
That means the two keys have fallen into their hands.

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,750
Even if it comes to it, there's no meaning in me running away alone.

27
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,930
You must somehow get back to that straw-hat's place!

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,890
It's impossible...

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,380
Just by being with them, I'll hurt them!

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,370
The people from the government may qualify your existence as a crime, but...

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,070
Whatever disaster you can bring to this world, just being here can't be considered a crime.

32
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,070
Existing can't be a crime!

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,090
Open the Main Gate!

34
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,190
What is this place!?

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,990
That's a... waterfall!?

36
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,820
I can't see the bottom!

37
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,240
You're noisy, uh...

38
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,280
Lucci and the others are heading toward us.

39
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,660
Bringing with them the best souvenir we could ever wish for.

40
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,540
Can't you go any faster?

41
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,640
Hey, then Franky-aniki sacrificed himself!?

42
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,570
Yeah, that's right.

43
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
He was trying to save Robin-chan.

44
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,390
What a kind hearted person! Aniki!

45
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,800
We've gotta hurry or we'll arrive late.

46
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,440
Oi, I see it! The light of the no night island!

47
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,090
It's Enies Lobby!

48
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,070
What, for real?

49
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,000
We're going to save aniki!

50
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,910
No night island?

51
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,290
There's never night on this island, we call it a daytime island!

52
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,320
This is the Judiciary Island!

53
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,510
Daytime island?

54
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,010
I found them!

55
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,110
The big yagaras!!

56
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,790
Oiii!!

57
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,150
Luffy!!

58
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,890
Ah! Sanji!!

59
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,920
And...

60
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,620
Who the hell is that?

61
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,810
It's been a while...

62
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,450
It's straw-hat-san!!

63
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,970
We got back on the track well.

64
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,930
Looks like the guys will come to the entrance of the world government too!

65
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,950
Isn't that promising?

66
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,470
Yosh! Enies Lobby is in sight!

67
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,640
All hands, prepare for battle!

68
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,970
And then...

69
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,530
This is the wonderful day when the 8 members of the CP9, including myself,

70
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,420
will finally be gathered together, but...

71
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,240
What's the meaning of this article!?

72
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,520
In our new plan to assassinate the leader of the revolution,

73
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,650
the orders were to take out 3 people and your mission would have been over...

74
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,940
But you just had to kill 23 people, right!?

75
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,260
If you have excuses, try them!

76
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,250
Yoyoi!!

77
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,200
I make all my apologies, chief!

78
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,800
Everything is--

79
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,750
My responsibility!

80
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,970
Stop that, Kumadori!

81
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,640
A man shouldn't lower his head so easily!

82
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,890
I'll explain everything to the chief, so sit down!

83
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,000
Yoyoi! I'm really sorry, chief! If it comes to it, I'll...

84
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,410
Open my stomach and take full responsibility!

85
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,620
Don't say stupid things!

86
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,350
Yoyoi!

87
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,750
It's wrong, chief!

88
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,190
We followed the plan and started the infiltration for the assassination!

89
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,100
The plan no one was supposed to know about was mysteriously discovered!

90
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,820
I talked about the assassination plan in town, chapapa!

91
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,160
What? So it was you again, Fukurou!

92
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,550
What does that damn zipper on your mouth serve for then!?

93
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,600
And when will that big mouth of yours be cured!?

94
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,000
We are supposed to be the most elite secret agents!

95
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,340
I talked about it accidentally, chapapa.

96
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,850
Don't 'chapapa' me!

97
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,040
Yoyoyoi!!

98
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,390
Can't do anything about this, I accidentally talked about it!

99
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,660
I talked about it, chapapa!

100
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,230
No, don't blame Fukurou for this!

101
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,400
You...!

102
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,470
I talked, chapapa!

103
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,620
Shut up, will you!?

104
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,170
I will take that responsibility!

105
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:16,980
Seppuku!

106
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,750
I can't die...

107
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,530
Hurry up and die, you damn bastard!

108
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,600
I accidentally talked about it, chapapa!

109
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,970
Shut up, I understood!

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,280
It's okay guys, I understand.

111
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,920
Hot!! I spilt my coffee! Shit!!

112
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,550
And I heard Nero wasn't of any use!

113
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,710
Mah, it's okay...

114
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,070
Sogeking from the Sniper Island?

115
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,330
That's right! I'm one of Usopp's close friends.

116
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,430
I'm here to help you out on your journey.

117
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,250
I-It's a hero!

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,300
I knew it from the beginning since he had a cape!

119
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,630
Awesome! It's the first time I've seen a hero!

120
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,630
Really? He's a hero because he's wearing a mantle?

121
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,540
Right! The mantled baboons are heroes too!

122
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,600
Really!?

123
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,010
Isn't that Usopp?

124
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,940
I knew you were awesome since I saw that cape!

125
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,370
Usopp, I'm glad you're safe.

126
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,460
It's the long nose that entered the Franky House...

127
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
It's the long nose who got caught with aniki...

128
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,220
It's him.

129
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,110
Pleased to meet you!

130
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,800
It's the niichan we met at Shift Station.

131
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,360
Please sign this!

132
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,730
But then...

133
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,680
Where did Usopp go?

134
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,690
He's safe. You don't need to worry at all.

135
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,740
Anyway, he said to concentrate our full forces on saving Robin-kun for now.

136
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,670
He's absolutely right!

137
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,390
Wh-

138
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,500
Where is the island of snipers?

139
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,920
It is...

140
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,660
It is inside...

141
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,030
your hearts.

142
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,650
In our hearts!

143
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,690
Where's that!?

144
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,280
On Sharpshooter Island!

145
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,640
"Where I was born", say it!

146
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,420
Where I was born!

147
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,100
Nami-san.

148
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,140
100 shots.

149
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,920
What is it, Sanji-kun?

150
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
100 shots!

151
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,920
100, say it!

152
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,810
And the other idiots except Nami-san.

153
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,420
100!

154
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,630
Hits, say it!

155
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,560
Hits!

156
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,050
Before we go and save Robin...

157
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,370
Just hear me out for a bit.

158
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,090
That Buster Call is the problem.

159
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,270
Long ago, a certain island was destroyed.

160
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,030
Five vice-admirals and ten marine battleships.

161
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,800
For that woman who has faced that overwhelming power,

162
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,300
the Buster Call is a nightmare she can't run away from.

163
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,950
The memory of the fear that built up in her since she was young is now pointed toward her nakama.

164
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,320
She lost the will to oppose us.

165
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,340
Don't tell me...

166
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,300
Knowing all this...

167
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,070
That's evident.

168
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:29,260
That's the situation. Robin is somehow being controlled by the CP9.

169
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm not making excuses for not being able to retrieve her.

170
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,100
But as we're preparing to enter the enemy's ground,

171
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,250
we can't be sure if Robin-chan will accept to return with us.

172
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,300
No, it's over. We won't meet again.

173
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,630
Like all that matters!! I won't forgive her!!

174
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,620
That Robin!

175
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,730
Why her!?

176
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,740
That's how it is! Why should we go save her if she doesn't want to?

177
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,000
Robin is suffering because she worries about what'll happen to our crew once we save her!

178
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,150
I don't care about all that!

179
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,050
If we leave her, Robin will get killed, right!?

180
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,750
Since she doesn't want to die, we'll save her!

181
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,410
That's evident, but...!

182
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,600
Stop it. This doesn't change what we have to do.

183
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,220
We'll save her and that's all.

184
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,540
I'm gonna kick their asses!

185
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,550
And I have new techniques I want to try!

186
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,000
Look at this for a bit guys.

187
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,270
I once came here to repair the rails.

188
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,960
I drew this using the vague memories I have from that time.

189
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,420
This is an overall map of Enies Lobby's terrain.

190
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,550
The Gate of Justice is located at the back of the island.

191
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,550
You can go there by passing through the Judiciary Tower.

192
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,720
What's this? What's the black thing?

193
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,620
The black part is the waterfall.

194
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,680
Waterfall?

195
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,380
You'll understand when we pass the gate.

196
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,780
From the Main Gate to the Gate of Justice.

197
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,100
If we don't get back Nico Robin and Franky during that period of time, we lose.

198
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,620
Why's that?

199
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,720
Wherever Robin is taken away, we just have to follow her until we succeed!

200
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,410
I told you before we left Water 7, didn't I?

201
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,220
If we pass that gate, our destination will either be the Marines' Headquarters or the Great Submarine Prison!

202
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,880
No matter what, we must settle things before that.

203
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,280
That's how it is.

204
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,700
But still, even if we all get on the island,

205
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,900
the ones who really stand a chance to win against the CP9 are...

206
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,830
Just you guys.

207
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,030
I understood that strength well while travelling on this train with you.

208
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:54,910
That's why you should wait here for five minutes and then bash into the main island with the Rocketman!

209
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:02,130
We'll go fight first and open a passage so that the train can pass between the Main Gate and the Main Island Gate.

210
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,750
After that, we want you to go on, no matter how many of us fall.

211
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,720
We may have around 60 members, but the other side should have around 2000 or 3000 soldiers.

212
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,990
You straw-hats should try to avoid unnecessary battles and only concentrate on following the CP9!

213
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,050
Yeah, I got it!

214
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,310
Hey guys, this is the front of the island!

215
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,000
Look well at the sky behind Enies Lobby.

216
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,380
That is the Gate of Justice!

217
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,970
SO HUGE!!

218
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,440
It'd be bad to open it completely...

219
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,670
When a criminal goes in, they only open the door a bit to let him through.

220
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:01,950
And behind that door is a huge region of the ocean that's like the Calm Belt, cutting through the Grand Line.

221
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,510
You can't go there with a normal ship.

222
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,400
I don't know how they manage to do it,

223
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,530
but the marines have a way to pass through there safely.

224
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,820
In other words, it's like what the pirate girl said.

225
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,590
You can't take back a criminal that's been captured and taken there.

226
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,120
That means that the passage through the gate is the limit!

227
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,460
Saa! There is no time to hesitate!

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,620
Then we'll infiltrate the island according to the plan!

229
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,700
Let us cover you!

230
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,550
Oi!! Aren't those two with us?

231
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,740
Hey, where is Luffy?

232
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,260
He was here until just now...

233
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,250
Hey! It's straw-hat-san!

234
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,420
What the hell is he doing all by himself!?

235
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,620
That guy doesn't understand the plan at all!

236
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,160
It didn't serve any purpose...

237
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,310
He said he understood, right?

238
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,960
Waiting five minutes is impossible for him.

239
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,570
I guess so.

240
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,020
What an impatient one.

241
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,420
Go, pirate-niichan!

242
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,610
Don't slow down! Sodome, Gomorrha!

243
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,380
Jump over that fence and break the Main Gate open!

244
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,270
What was that?

245
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,870
Something just flew over...

246
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,200
What's up with this place?

247
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,470
There's such a huge hole! It looks like the island is floating!

248
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,390
There's a town, too. Robin...

249
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,220
I wonder if she's in there.

250
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,350
There's someone up there! Shoot him down immediately!

251
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,660
I've been spotted!

252
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,780
He passed the gate!

253
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,630
This is the Main Gate! This is the Main Gate!

254
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,820
This is a message for the chief officer in the main island!

255
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,070
This is the Main Gate, I'm requesting an answer!

256
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,650
What do you want? What's happening?

257
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,170
There's an intruder who passed the Main Gate and is heading to the main island!

258
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:57,390
What? Surely you can at least take care of just one intruder.

259
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,500
But, that...!

260
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,610
This is the main island!

261
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,400
We've identified the intruder. We'll take care of him now.

262
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't worry.

263
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,040
Hey there little guy, stop running.

264
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,300
Do you know where you are?

265
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,180
Please be careful when dealing with him!

266
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,550
If my eyes are right, this man could be...

267
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,300
Straw-hat Luffy!

268
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
What!? What did you just say!?

269
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,140
I think he's the man with a 100 million bounty.

270
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,750
The straw-hat pirate!

271
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:40,890
Robin...

272
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,700
Where is Robin!?

273
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,710
You're annoying! Get out of the way!

274
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,930
Is this guy picking a fight with the World Government!?

275
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,610
Robin, just wait!

276
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,320
Next time, One Piece: Luffy Charges In!
Great Decisive Battle on the Judiciary Island!

277
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

278
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,300
Here's how you can get your present!

279
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,850
Write the four letters that appeared in the show, your address, your full name, your age,

280
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,220
your opinion of the show and you may win a lot of prizes!

281
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,460
The last keyword is... this!

182
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,479
this old city exists
always in all its splendor.

183
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,090
Shandora.

184
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,770
However, a legendary city cannot expose its splendor if this one is covered by the clouds.

185
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,990
It is me which discovered it.

186
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,360
My stupid predecessors
had never noticed it.

187
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,620
And you are?

188
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,770
God.

189
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,829
You impressed me.

190
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,310
You seem to be one
archeologist of the Blue Sea.

191
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:06,120
We spent months and
month to locate these ruins.

192
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,000
I see that it becomes easy of
to find, if one can read their inscriptions.

193
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,320
But gold that you
research is not here any more.

194
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,770
You are in delay of a few years.

195
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,689
Gold?

196
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,949
Now that you it
said, I did not see any.

197
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,000
Then it is you who took it.

198
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,349
It was to be thus.

199
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,810
This famous metal is very
coveted by people like me.

200
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,170
Then you also took
the Gold Bell which was there?

201
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,790
Hum? A Gold Bell?

202
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,260
It is not with the current?

203
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,450
It is very interesting.

204
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,969
You!

205
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,289
What you learned in
deciphering these symbols?

206
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,659
Nothing, unfortunately.

207
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,329
If it were not
there on your arrival…

208
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,229
it is that it is not
ever gone up in the sky.

209
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,669
Pride of Shandora.

210
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,350
A gigantic Gold Bell and
the Large Belfry which supported it.

211
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,160
This belfry interested me.

212
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,829
Not, wait. It was here.

213
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,130
It is here, in the sky!

214
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,490
It was 400 years ago, the day when
this island flew away in the sky…

215
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,010
It is well that, the day when the island
from God, Upper Yard, was born…

216
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,590
The knell of a giant bell
resounds in all the territory.

217
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,989
The elder ones baptized it…

218
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,240
song of the island.

219
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,089
It is thus that!

220
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,709
This bell was out of gold!

221
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,940
Splendid…

222
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,159
The play touches soon at its end.

223
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,159
There remain eight minutes.

224
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,040
While waiting, I you suggest that
we sought in the surroundings…

225
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,760
the Gold Bell!

226
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,929
Is the Gold Bell assembled in the sky?

227
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,170
And thus Ponéglyphe with!

228
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,810
I hear a ver de terre
on bank of the island.

229
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,080
Hold good, I you in
beg, Usopp-san, Sanji-san.

230
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,570
They still do not have
begun again knowledge?

231
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,749
But…

232
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,200
But they will be restored soon, Père.

233
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,859
Of course.

234
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,429
They are noble-hearted mans.

235
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,210
There is no reason
that they are not left there.

236
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,609
Conis-san.

237
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,290
I hope that once it
sky will have found peace…

238
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,890
I could help the others with
to appreciate what their heart contains,

239
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,990
you including.

240
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,570
Father…

241
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,079
That
do it pass, Suu?

242
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,689
It is the hour of your meal?

243
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,959
Suu, that there
does it have?

244
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
You have some share badly?

245
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,209
Summers you…?

246
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,160
Six years ago, I belonged to those
who fought at the sides of Gan Fall-sama.

247
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,239
What wants to say that you are
a true Soldier of God?

248
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,540
We… were locked up
in a cave…

249
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,939
Dear Sir, that did occur?

250
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,089
Conis-san, the case
help! Quickly!

251
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,939
Yes, Father!

252
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,220
Wait!

253
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,720
I have a woman and one
child on Angel Island.

254
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,530
Yes, everyone is
anxious for you all.

255
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,319
Please, say to them!

256
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,879
Eneru…

257
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,720
all will destroy!

258
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,769
Skypiea will be returned
in the Blue Sea!

259
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,469
All the country will disappear!

260
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,810
C… It is impossible!

261
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,269
Time ago to lose!

262
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,659
Dispatch you to inform everyone!

263
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,780
Eneru…

264
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,440
is about to exterminate
all inhabitants of the sky!!

265
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,610
To exterminate all the inhabitants of the sky?

266
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,989
With… Wait, please!

267
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,439
If it does that,

268
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,080
Eneru God will not have null
leaves where to also go him…

269
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,209
He has the Arch!

270
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,880
The Arch, Maxim!

271
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,670
The Arch… Maxim?

272
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,390
What you go…?!

273
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,960
During these six years, we were forced to manufacture an Arch which flies through the sky!

274
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,860
I hope that once it
sky will have found peace…

275
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,859
I could help the others with
to appreciate what their heart contains,

276
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,780
you including.

277
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,230
FATHER!!

1
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,740
Do what you want of Merry.

2
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,880
We will get a new boat and will continue our voyage.

3
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,930
Goodbye, Usopp.

4
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,880
One spent good moments together.

5
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,600
Make your decision.

6
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,820
On which can one count if you hesitate?

7
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,960
Let us leave this boat…

8
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,120
We will not return any more on this ship.

9
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,760
Remu-household in the city of water!
Iceberg-san taken for target!

10
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,769
Who discovered the body?

11
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,579
Let ask us some questions!

12
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,789
Are there suspects?

13
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,519
Would there be a bond with the destruction of Franky House?

14
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,619
A comment?

15
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,680
Give us information, please!

16
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,599
Are Oi, to you with the current of the events on the building site?

17
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,629
Then he really died?

18
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,439
It is inevitably a blow of Franky!

19
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,489
If one had not left it in freedom, that would not have arrived.

20
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,549
It is completely possible that they are the pirates who visited the building site.

21
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,799
Some say to have heard an explosion on the coast.

22
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,929
Would there be a bond?

23
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,630
What it appears, the engineers had many relations with the pirates.

24
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,440
Then you were there.

25
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,710
Thus a room was rented but nobody makes use of it.

26
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,690
It is probably that nobody is sleepy.

27
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,540
Where is Luffy?

28
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,830
Over there.

29
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,630
Sanji, where were you?

30
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,619
I excavated the rock coasts all the night.

31
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,820
I hoped to find Robin-chan there.

32
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,440
I wonder where it left without us to prevent.

33
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,110
It arrived to us only of the troubles since our arrival on this island.

34
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,040
The money disappears…

35
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,210
Then all these events with Usopp.

36
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,060
With all its wounds…

37
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,219
It must be feverish and does not have to be able any more to move!

38
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,360
Chopper…

39
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,300
I do not want to intend some any more to speak.

40
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,850
I will make a turn downtown today.

41
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,230
Will Robin be found?

42
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,370
Who knows?

43
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,760
I do not dare even any more to hope…

44
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,300
But it is certain that it is in this city.

45
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,740
In the event of problem, we will use this inn as point of appointment.

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,220
I will seek me too!

47
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,060
Of agreement… Yosh.

48
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,739
Luffy!

49
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,180
Nami-san!

50
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,320
It is horrible!

51
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,280
Everyone speaks downtown about it!

52
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,130
Luffy, this night, Iceberg-san with the building site…

53
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,600
Was iceberg-san reduced at his place?

54
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,860
Oi, stops your conneries!

55
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,459
He died?!

56
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,329
Not, oi!

57
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,019
He was not however haï of anybody!

58
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,759
Wait a little!

59
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,460
Calm yourself, Paulee!

60
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,559
Listen to me!

61
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,489
Good… It was discovered this morning…

62
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,940
Lengthened at his place, in enough of blood.

63
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,580
It is still unconscious but…

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,010
Come to the office immediately!

65
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
Is excentric, where Paulee?

66
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,639
I have just called it.

67
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,890
It arrives.

68
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,210
Of agreement.

69
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,310
Outside, the journalists try to return and foutent the brothel.

70
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,820
But let us not know we more than them.

71
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,689
Inside, it is a true battle field.

72
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,150
But neither money, nor objects were stolen

73
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,890
If it is not a burglar, then who did that with Iceberg-san and why?

74
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,060
It is a catastrophe.

75
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,370
The city is in panic.

76
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,239
If its state does not improve…

77
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,750
It is the end of Galley it Company and Toilets 7.

78
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,580
Doctor…

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,850
How is that presented?

80
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,680
Two blows per front and three by behind.

81
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,900
I do not know what it occurred in this room, but it is horrible.

82
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,979
According to the report/ratio…

83
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,760
The locks of this building were not forced.

84
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,330
Such a scenario did not take place absolutely to be in this room.

85
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,760
The only evidence of the scene of the crime…

86
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,980
Is a mask, findable in any store.

87
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,150
Ice-ossan?

88
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,880
They said that it was still unconscious.

89
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,150
Why him? Everyone likes it here…

90
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,239
Who is this, Nami-san?

91
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,330
It is the man who accommodated us yesterday.

92
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,089
The chief of the building site and the mayor of Toilets 7.

93
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,989
It is a very important person.

94
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,989
Yes.

95
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,139
It is the worst thing than it could arrive at this city.

96
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,390
I leave to make a turn.

97
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,560
Wait, Luffy! I come with you!

98
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,740
Then let us leave to research Robin-san.

99
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,139
And you?

100
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,290
Not.

101
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,230
I wait to see what it will occur.

102
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,239
Breaking news!

103
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,789
Breaking news!

104
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,249
The mayor Iceberg-san, the hero of Toilets 7…

105
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,569
Assassinated by a demon!

106
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,900
The last scoops!

107
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,729
How is Iceberg-san?

108
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,640
It is horrible. Why him?

109
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,379
Who could well do that?

110
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,829
Who is this criminal?

111
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,619
There is no information.

112
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,849
Oi, Mr. journalist, this news do not have anything of comforting!

113
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,930
What does it occur?

114
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,579
It is surely still a blow of the pirates!

115
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,260
If one could catch them good once for all!

116
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,759
Yesterday, of the pirates have foutu the brothel with the Dock n°1.

117
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,290
The Mikazuki gang?

118
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,379
Ca can appear stupid, but in my opinion, it is the government which made the blow…

119
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,670
Excentric, whom do you say?

120
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,530
It is Kogi.

121
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,389
With each conversation with Iceberg-san, it was made throw.

122
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,620
The culprit is Franky, of course!

123
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,909
I do not know which was the subject of these conversations…

124
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,300
But to make a similar thing…

125
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,849
Stop overpowering the government.

126
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,010
If somebody heard you, that would make scandal.

127
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,279
Were the richness and the capacity the cause of this crime?

128
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,630
Who is this criminal, left without leaving traces?!

129
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,760
Anyone?! I will never forgive him!

130
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,069
Thank you to have chosen our company.

131
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,640
We arrive soon at Water 7, the Blue Station.

132
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:54,370
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

133
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,530
Paulee-san!

134
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,699
Paulee-san, a comment on the accident?!

135
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,629
Why did one ask you to come?

136
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,540
Close it. Release.

137
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,349
Which explanations has provides the company to you?

138
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,759
Some words, please?

139
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,539
You do not include/understand? I said, Dégagez!

140
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,709
According to you, for which reasons did one want to kill Iceberg?

141
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,149
Don't you remember anything?

142
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,499
A dispute with pirates?

143
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,449
Paulee-san, nothing aut…

144
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,729
I SAID AI, RELEASE!

145
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,940
BANDAGE CRETINS!

146
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,360
Luffy, by there!

147
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,070
Yosh, more quickly, Yagara!

148
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,250
How are you, Yagara-chan?

149
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,930
Then please.

150
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,350
It is in connection with Iceberg-san.

151
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,580
Then it is true, it was made attack.

152
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,070
Yes. We will not re-examine it any more with the shipyard.

153
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,119
Let us go to Ossan.

154
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,640
He lives in the offices.

155
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,749
Yes…

156
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,220
Because I am too weak…

157
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,140
They took…

158
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,550
All money.

159
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,650
How will I tell that with the others?

160
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,250
Just at the moment when we could finally repair Merry.

161
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,280
Nami.

162
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,860
With what you do think?

163
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,600
With nothing.

164
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,840
Kiwi, Mozu…

165
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,230
Do I dream?

166
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,860
Not, Aniki.

167
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,919
There is no doubt, Franky House was well there before.

168
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,239
But all has well…

169
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,130
Changed.

170
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,630
It IS WHAT THIS BROTHEL?!!

171
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,500
Why my house in particular?!

172
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,520
I see… It is them.

173
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,259
Get stuffed, Luffy with the straw hat!

174
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,210
Is this your answer to have taken to you your 200 million?

175
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,880
Of what a right oses you to attack my men!

176
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,080
Which tragedy…

177
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,780
Unforgivable!

178
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,789
Franky-aniki!

179
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,099
You returned!

180
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,319
Aniki!

181
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,390
Are Oh, you there!? Ca reassures me.

182
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,580
One passed dirty fifteen minutes with these insane furious!

183
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,879
We waited until Aniki comes to avenge us…

184
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,740
Then we followed Straw hat!

185
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,690
Where is it?

186
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,549
We saw them returning in an inn.

187
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,109
From there, they moved towards the shipyard.

188
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,329
They are probably with the Dock n°1, where they were yesterday.

189
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,260
Then it is thus? I include/understand.

190
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,640
Luffy with the straw hat…

191
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,470
You will take a beating!

192
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,149
Grandmother! Grandmother!

193
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,489
There is much wind!

194
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,270
He!

195
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,919
Much wind… much of wind… much of wind!

196
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,410
Stop playing!

197
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,580
It is Carrock, the wind of the south.

198
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,400
The waves are increasingly large.

199
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,020
The train of the sea will not leave this evening.

200
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,789
Chimney, Gonbe, prepare you to turn over on the island!

201
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,210
Ouiii!

202
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,450
Aqua Laguna arrives!

203
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,890
Announces:

204
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,350
Here the weather station of Toilets 7.

205
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,470
We inform you of the imminent arrival of Aqua Laguna.

206
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,159
It will be in Water 7 in the neighborhoods of 00:30.

207
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,669
It is true, I had completely forgotten.

208
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,379
One is worried so much by the accident of Iceberg-san.

209
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,379
Ooi, Aqua Laguna arrives!

210
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,529
Inform everyone!

211
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,690
Cease work!

212
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,029
It is what?

213
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,020
Aqua Laguna?

214
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,810
He, you! Wait!

215
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,490
Which was this message at the moment?

216
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,619
How?

217
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,199
Ah, you are a traveller.

218
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,770
And well, You arrive at the bad moment.

219
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,520
Aqua Laguna is a high tide.

220
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,209
A high tide?

221
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,609
Yes, you must shelter in an elevated place because…

222
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,240
The city will be found submerged.

223
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,530
The city… Under the sea?

224
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,509
Completely, but it is not for immediately.

225
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,820
According to the station, it is for this evening.

226
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,940
Ca occurs each year. Would be careful!

227
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,500
Ouais.

228
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,930
Submerged by the sea…

229
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,180
He?! This place will run?!

230
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,619
It would seem.

231
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,020
At all events, let us find Robin-chan quickly.

232
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,669
Moreover, by where does one have to seek?

233
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,710
And well…

234
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,170
Where did it can have gone?

235
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,640
Hum…

236
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,730
Perhaps on an archeological site?

237
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,670
There is no that by here. Another thing?

238
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,829
And well…

239
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,549
She does not like anything else?

240
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,589
An archeological site.

241
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,129
Nothing others?

242
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,379
And you, Sanji, you know another thing?!

243
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,889
If I ask it is that I know anything of it!

244
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,089
Does not pass to me in front!

245
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,840
Why?!

246
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,910
Perhaps we do not know enough Robin-chan.

247
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,459
Please, said to us something.

248
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,619
Iceberg-san!

249
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,970
What did it occur here?

250
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,440
What was there?

251
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,659
One will not be able to enter by here.

252
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,240
In any event, one must absolutely re-examine Ice-ossan.

253
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,839
Heu, excuse me.

254
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,340
Where is the entry of the offices?

255
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,789
Ca is not used for nothing.

256
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:13,170
Only the authorities and certain journalists can enter.

257
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,870
One is all there to wait and to worry.

258
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,349
I see.

259
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,800
Thank you.

260
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,000
Which is all this agitation?

261
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,880
And well, it is still better with spectators.

262
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,699
This music…

263
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,259
Not, it is not possible!

264
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,859
Why at a similar moment?

265
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,079
He, everyone! You called me?!

266
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,489
At all! You break!

267
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,270
Where! Where it is?!

268
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,670
Over there!

269
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,250
It appears!

270
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,260
Do not be timid, listen to all!?

271
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,100
Acclaim me!

272
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,009
It is you who attacked Iceberg-san!

273
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,839
He?!

274
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,350
It is inevitably him!

275
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,729
Release from this island!

276
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,010
Catch this gangster.

277
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,440
Bandage insects.

278
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,429
I am the superman of this island!

279
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,809
The hidden side of Toilets 7!

280
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,450
Yes, me am called:

281
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,350
FRANKY!

282
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,150
Show yourself, Straw hat!

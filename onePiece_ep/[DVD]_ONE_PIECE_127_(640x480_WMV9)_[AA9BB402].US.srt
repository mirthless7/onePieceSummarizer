1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,770
I AM...

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,210
...THE MAN WHO'LL BECOME THE PIRATE KING!

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,920
PLEASE STOP FIGHTING!!

23
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,510
The battle is...

24
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,150
...over.

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,790
The rain, just as it is falling...

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,730
Just as it always has,

27
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,430
will fall again.

28
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,670
The nightmare is all over.

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:57,050
Arms merit Smoker!
A pirate and some justice

30
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,970
"The nightmare is all over"!?

31
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,920
Don't give us that!

32
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,940
You can't just call this some bad dream!

33
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,840
He's right!

34
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,920
We saw the King attack Nanohana with our own eyes!

35
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,710
Yeah!

36
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,170
And Kohza-san was shot by the Royal Army!

37
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,060
The Royal Army has fought dirty this whole time!

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,270
How can we accept that for those who have died for this rebellion!?

39
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,920
THROW DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,170
ROYAL ARMY!

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,050
Chaka-sama!

42
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,390
Chaka!

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,070
Hey, what are you doing?

44
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,500
You-

45
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,170
Mah-mah-maaah~! 

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,200
You do the same! Rebel Army!

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,880
I-Igaram-san!

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,040
Captain!

49
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,950
Igaram!

50
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,160
Igaram-san!

51
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,980
We shall meet again upon our homeland.

52
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,090
That's the cross-dressing guy from Whiskey Peak!

53
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,640
He's alive!

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,930
But who is he?

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,090
Hey, can you speak?

56
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,630
It's that kid from Nanohana.

57
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,170
That's right. That's the kid who got hurt by the Royal Army.

58
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,770
No.

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,250
Someone else did this to me.

60
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,650
Everyone, listen!

61
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,740
I saw them!

62
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,290
I just don't feel right without this thing on my head!

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,410
Ambiguous~!

64
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,120
That's right.

65
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,300
This war was... set up from the beginning.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,330
Kohza-san!

67
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,450
Leader!

68
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,360
Everything that has happened to this country,

69
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,680
I shall explain, myself, in full detail.

70
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,020
Throw down your weapons, all of you!

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,600
Vivi-sama!

72
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,950
Everyone, Where are you?

73
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,630
Oi...

74
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,580
Get up and walk already!

75
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,910
Well... listen to this...

76
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,170
I've come down with I-will-die-if-I-walk-any-futher Disease.

77
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,330
Then stay there.

78
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,360
Eh? Hey w-wait! Whoa! Wait!

79
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,230
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa!

80
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,530
Why my leg!?

81
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,610
There he is.

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,930
Who are you?

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,020
Ah, that guy on your back...

84
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,930
Thank for carrying him out of there.

85
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,590
He's with us. We'll take him from here.

86
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,540
So you are the pirates who brought Vivi back to this country.

87
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,620
Who are you, Ossan?

88
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,810
Papa!

89
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,360
Everyone!

90
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,870
Ah, it's Vivi!

91
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,890
Papa?

92
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,620
VIVI-CHAN'S FATHER!!?

93
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,520
You're the King?

94
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,640
I was prepared for death,

95
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,620
But he saved me.

96
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,620
After he fought with Crocodile,

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,940
He carried both of us back up to the surface.

98
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,520
It is difficult to comceive of one possessing so much power.

99
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,810
And we don't have to worry about that poison?

100
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,200
No, he's already taken the antidote.

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,510
But he must be treated for his wounds,

102
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,750
As well as all of you.

103
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,820
So Vivi, hurry up and go already.

104
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,320
Eh?

105
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,230
Get back to the Square.

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,630
That's right.

107
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,570
The country's rebellion is finally over.

108
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,530
But without the words of the King and Princess to guide it, it won't be a real ending.

109
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,720
Then, we should all-

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,510
Vivi-chan.

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,720
You understand, right?

112
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,100
We're marked men.

113
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,130
We ain't gonna concern ourselves with countries and such!

114
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,270
I'm hungry.

115
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,960
We'll get to the Palace when we're ready.

116
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,180
We're exhausted.

117
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,090
Yes.

118
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,480
Understood, Captain Smoker.

119
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,540
So you mean, Crocodile-san...

120
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,120
He was behind everything?

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,300
How can that be? I can't believe it...

122
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,410
Hey, look over there!

123
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,450
It's the Marines!

124
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:40,020
A Baroque Works ship carrying Dance Powder for use in creating artificial rainfall has been captured.

125
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,570
Leader of the secret criminal organization, Baroque Works,

126
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,970
Shichibukai Pirate, Sir Crocodile.

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,180
Which way'd he go? That croc!

128
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,690
By order of the Marine Headquarters, acting with the authority of the World Government,

129
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,960
In accordance with the Naval Enemy Seizure clause,

130
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,290
You are henceforth stripped of all titles and privileges granted to you by the Government.

131
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,110
Just you watch...

132
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,720
We have done things... we can never take back.

133
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
Leader...

134
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,780
I can't find the words to speak to them...

135
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,500
It is natural to mourn.

136
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,080
As it is to feel intolerable emotions.

137
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,670
The King!

138
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,110
Your Majesty...

139
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,950
We have lost much,

140
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,650
And gained nothing.

141
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,310
But, we shall move forward!

142
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,690
No matter who you fought against,

143
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,160
That war happened, and now it is over!

144
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,820
King...

145
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,780
No one can erase what has happened in the past!

146
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,400
STAND UPON THIS WAR AND LIVE!

147
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,540
He is great...

148
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,510
KINGDOM OF ARABASTA!

149
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,660
And so a battle that would be written down in history...

150
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,040
And a battle that would never be spoken of again...

151
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,830
...finally ended.

152
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,260
Smoker-kun!

153
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,100
What is the meaning of this rain?

154
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,010
I hope you didn't use that Dance Powder.

155
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,570
Moron.

156
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,140
I know what a crime is.

157
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,640
The King of Arabasta logically chose to protect his country without using that powder.

158
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,720
Why would I ruin that?

159
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,870
Pardon me.

160
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,110
Hina contemplating.

161
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,240
Such charming words now and again... from the man they call the "White Hunter".

162
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,610
Have you gotten rounder since I last saw you?

163
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,790
Mind your own business.

164
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,190
Nevertheless, wasn't this all a bit extreme?

165
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,520
Using my elite squad for a mere ship hunt...

166
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,740
It's quite unthinkable.

167
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,020
Hina unthinkable.

168
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,100
We're friends from the same class at the Academy.

169
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,370
Don't be like that.

170
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,100
I always sympathize... that poor Tashigi's troubles.

171
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,210
But more importantly...

172
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,720
I want you to take this artificial rain ship to Headquarters.

173
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,320
Why?

174
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,840
Along with the prisoner Tashigi is bringing back with her, Crocodile.

175
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,010
Enough of this.

176
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,340
You think I'll do that just because you say so?

177
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,560
Heads.

178
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,710
Tails.

179
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,320
You lose.

180
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,610
You really are used to getting your own way.
You haven't changed a bit since you enlisted.

181
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,270
Hina despair.

182
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,170
Yeah, that's fine by me.

183
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,330
I know I haven't.

184
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,890
This is an order.

185
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,400
SERGEANT MAJOR!

186
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,520
This is our CHANCE!

187
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,830
While they're unconscious, we can take them-

188
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,780
Right now, I will not allow anyone to lay a single hand on them!

189
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,730
B-But why!?

190
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,730
We've got them all here!

191
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,610
Aren't we trying to arrest them!?

192
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,960
F-Furthermore...

193
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,740
Leader...

194
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,120
Your wounds... You'll be alright, won't you?

195
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,450
You won't die, right?

196
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,330
Listen, Toto-ojisan was... Yuba was...

197
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,680
Vivi.

198
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,730
You still worry too much about everything.

199
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,060
No matter what happens to Yuba,

200
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,680
That stubborn old man won't die.

201
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,570
Leader...

202
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,750
And after all, I've got his blood flowing through my veins.

203
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,980
As soon as I'm treated, I'll go back to Yuba.

204
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,050
I'll tell the whole Kingdom about it.

205
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,010
So don't worry.

206
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,320
Okay.

207
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,130
IT'S RAINING!

208
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,990
Rain!

209
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,100
After three long years, it's finally raining!

210
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,140
Now the rebellion will end!

211
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,270
Our foolish sons will return home!

212
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,890
Rain!

213
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,190
How long will that spirit of yours last, old man!?

214
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,560
Yuba is finished!

215
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,670
What are you going to do here all by yourself!?

216
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,940
Are you going to die with the town!?

217
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,950
OLD MAN!

218
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,210
Look, Kohza.

219
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,220
The rain is falling.

220
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,120
Just three years.

221
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,810
That's all it took.

222
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,130
Right...

223
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
Rain?

224
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,130
And the rain, no longer threatened,

225
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,640
Withholding none of itself, fell endlessly upon the Kingdom.

226
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,870
Vivi-sama?

227
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,690
Are you still awake?

228
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,750
Igaram.

229
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,630
Can you not sleep?

230
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,820
No...

231
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,180
I don't want to sleep.

232
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,110
I want to watch the rain, just a little longer.

233
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,550
About Pell...

234
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,990
That man...

235
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,090
...was the noblest, stronger warrior I have ever known.

236
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes...

237
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,560
I wanted to say, "Thank you".

238
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,520
There would be no greater honor to him.

239
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,280
Captain Smoker! Hina-jou!

240
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,160
Sergeant Major Tashigi has arrived!

241
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,160
Good work!

242
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,340
It's been a long time, Tashigi.

243
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,810
Hina-san.

244
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,860
Good day.

245
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,210
I'm... a little tired, so I'm going to rest for a bit.

246
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,300
Captain Smoker, I'm back.

247
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,430
Yeah. Good job.

248
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,870
I heard about the business with Straw Hat.

249
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,590
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,480
I lent aid to pirates.

251
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,310
They were in our hands, but I let them escape.

252
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,020
These are disgraceful things for a Marine to do.

253
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
Why are you apologizing?

254
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,920
That was your justice, wasn't it?

255
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,710
It... was not.

256
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,060
Sergeant Major...

257
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,540
It was the only thing I could do.

258
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Dogs that run away to lick their wounds have no right to speak of justice.

259
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,710
That is a rule of this sea.

260
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,730
Where'd that croc go!?

261
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,080
Tell me!

262
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,740
Even though I knew where the enemy was,

263
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,400
I could do nothing but tell him.

264
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,580
Even though I knew when the bombing would occur,

265
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,320
I could do nothing but back them up.

266
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,640
I had...

267
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,950
...no justice to choose.

268
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,110
Those who I had come to think of as the same level as myself...

269
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,700
...are now dashing ahead and gaining an infamous name for themselves.

270
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,710
On this sea... If you don't dash ahead, you're as good as dead.

271
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,020
They know that well.

272
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,440
Go forward, or die?

273
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,810
Who was it that decided to come to this sea?

274
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,380
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,520
I... need to rest a little.

276
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,910
Idiot!

277
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,730
If those tears are so painful for you,

278
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,820
Then become stronger!

279
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,720
I WILL!!

280
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,670
I bet you grunts wish you had guts like hers.

281
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,400
Come on!

282
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,460
Bring the prisoners on board already!

283
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:23,890
Aye, Sir!

284
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,820
Captain Smoker! We've received contact from Headquarters!

285
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,620
This is the Marine Headquarters.

286
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,730
Is this Captain Smoker?

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,800
Speaking.

288
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,240
In regards to your subjugation of Crocodile,

289
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,470
You and Sergeant Major Tashigi are to report to the World Government...

290
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,960
...so that you may be presented with medals.

291
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,970
Subjugation?

292
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,850
Hey, hold on!

293
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,900
We didn't bring down Crocodile.

294
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,330
Did you listen to my report?

295
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,640
Furthermore, we have also decided to give you both a promotion in rank. The next concern-

296
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,610
Oi! Listen!

297
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,160
The people who have been fighting Crocodile and his Baroque Works this entire time...

298
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,250
...were the Straw Hat Pirates!

299
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,000
It's no use, Smoker-kun.

300
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,040
The Government wants to cover up the events which transpired here.

301
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,850
Do you honestly think that the Government can announce to the world...

302
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,420
...that the collapse of Arabasta was averted thanks to pirates?

303
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,110
The next concern is when you will be departing for your formal decoration ceremony-

304
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,230
Cut the crap!

305
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,000
Smoker-kun! Just accept it!

306
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,060
You know what will happen to you if you anger the brass...

307
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,610
We brought down Crocodile?

308
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,700
Because we DIDN'T do that, my subordinate is crying...

309
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,870
Oi, you.

310
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,900
I have a message for those old geezers at the World Government.

311
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,400
Yes?

312
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,710
Smoker-kun!

313
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,320
TELL THEM TO EAT SHIT!

314
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

315
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

316
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

317
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,290
What course can I set that will lead me to a better tomorrow?

318
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,210
Taking the helm, I spread out the map of miracles I had shut in my heart

319
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,470
Aiming for the sky, searching for a dream, there were times when I lost my way

320
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,890
But this isn't a dream, I found a wonderful part of myself when I met you

321
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,150
With a small bit of courage, I gained something large

322
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,360
So now is the time to change my dreams into vows.

323
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,340
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

324
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,080
Let's paint a story of the future

325
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,330
And put all of our thoughts into this new wind

326
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,380
Shining Ray! Find your brand new way.

327
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,340
A never ending journey to be together.

328
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,550
I'll chase it anywhere, this Shining Ray!

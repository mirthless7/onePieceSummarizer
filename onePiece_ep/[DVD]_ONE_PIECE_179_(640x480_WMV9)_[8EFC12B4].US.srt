1
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,050
Upper Yard

2
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:59,010
Angel Beach

3
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,499
The island of God:Upper Yard.

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,230
Zoro is confronted with the Priest
Ohm in the higher ruins.

5
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,020
SANRYUU

6
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,990
HYAKUHACHI POUND HOU

7
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,000
Wiper tries to penetrate in the stomach of
python, where Luffy and the others are retained.

8
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,350
After the discovery of the ruins of
Shandora, the Gold City, Nico Robin…

9
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,330
finds itself vis-a-vis
face with Eneru God.

10
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,550
At the same time, Conis learns
the appalling secrecy of Eneru God.

11
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,089
Skypiea will be returned
in the Blue Sea!

12
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,710
All the country will disappear!

13
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,250
FATHER!!

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,970
Higher Ruins in Crumbs!
The Final Quintet!!

15
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,140
Father…

16
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,470
Suu…

17
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,040
Time ago to lose!

18
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,329
Eneru…

19
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,210
Eneru is about to exterminate
all inhabitants of the sky!!

20
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,690
Skypiea will be returned
in the Blue Sea!

21
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,990
All the country will disappear!

22
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,099
It is not…

23
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,559
moment to cry.

24
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,620
We do not have time.

25
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,580
I must make my possible.

26
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,680
I must inform them!

27
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,669
Take care of them, Suu.

28
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,010
I must go there.

29
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,850
I must inform everyone. It
sacrificed itself to warn us!

30
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,430
All people of this
island must know!

31
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,059
This technique was
more difficult than envisaged.

32
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,940
Ca shows well that I have
still need for drive.

33
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,240
At least, maintaining it is calmer.

34
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,490
Sat!

35
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,680
He obeys everyone?!

36
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,340
Strike yourself the head and make dodo.

37
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,109
There remains nothing any more but it
snake and this guy with the bazooka.

38
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,830
I must make quickly.

39
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,879
I do not have the time of glander!

40
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,480
I am obliged to kill you!

41
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,979
Species of bloody nuisance!

42
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,780
Already died to you!

43
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,300
After all these blows,
he is always unscathed.

44
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,860
Afflicted, but it is
time for you to die!

45
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,879
Ca also, that does not go?!

46
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,890
Shit! Its skin is too much hard!

47
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,269
Brothel!

48
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,150
What it occurs?!

49
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,339
But what they
foutent outside?!

50
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,929
He! Come to help me!

51
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,270
He!

52
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,010
Nami, you ace interest to be in life.

53
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,000
That… It was what?

54
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,180
Mercy.

55
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:13,380
I raised a saving hand on a ver de terre twisting pain and I returned his freedom to him.

56
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,880
It is the duty of God, after all.

57
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,810
It would seem that the girl
hopelessly continue to run…

58
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,830
But it is time for all it
world to attend the celebration.

59
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,440
They will include/understand it
direction of the word despair.

60
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,120
This man…

61
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,160
[Note:logia = elementary]

62
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,020
Now, we have
less in less time.

63
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,759
Does one have to finish some?

64
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,230
The final plan is ready to be carried out.

65
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,960
The final plan…?

66
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,899
God calls upon you now!

67
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,170
Prosternez you in front
me, miserable mortals!

68
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,650
[Note:Sango is the god of
thunder at Yoruba (Africa)]

69
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,710
What?!

70
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,310
What…?!

71
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,529
I sent an invitation…

72
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,970
with your companions to come in Shandora!

73
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,839
Capacities of this man…

74
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,730
These capacities are terrifying.

75
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,840
The ground crumbles!

76
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,689
Eneru!

77
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,040
Ca can be only him!

78
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,410
I am in the shit
if I do not do anything!

79
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,500
Chopper!

80
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,989
It is what, that?

81
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,790
There is a hole in bottom?

82
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,820
How the large final one starts!

83
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,519
We are ready to fly.

84
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,289
Ouais, I have some enough now.

85
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,699
Luffy, catches Waver!

86
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,579
I will start again the engine!

87
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,280
He, you! Cling to me!

88
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,479
They is good! When you want, Nami!

89
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,430
Allons-y!

90
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,360
I finally will leave from here!

91
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,260
Wait! How their it arrived?!

92
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,989
Pierre, half-turn!

93
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,080
We must help them!

94
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,620
What?! One falls?!

95
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,010
I believe that one pricks of the nose!

96
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,489
Pierre, does not worry you for us!

97
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,720
Will help the two others inside!

98
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,499
What one makes,
Odd knight?!

99
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,679
At this speed, one course
straight towards death!

100
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,580
I am called Gan Fall! Gan Fall!

101
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,980
IT IS NOT the MOMENT!

102
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,820
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

103
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,330
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

104
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,120
Ruins…

105
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,500
How it can in
to fall as much from up there?

106
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,889
Mister the epeist!

107
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,259
I could breathe more.

108
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,370
You fell from up there
with the ruins?

109
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,839
Whore!

110
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,589
There I failed to remain!

111
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,560
Yes, you should be dead.

112
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,740
No matter who would be it.

113
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh, it is you.

114
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,640
Which is this place?

115
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,560
The place that us
sought, the Gold City.

116
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,349
Ah? Then it is that?

117
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,899
I will not have believed that one
was just above.

118
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,079
Then, you found the treasure?

119
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,320
Not, there is no gold here.

120
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,270
Ouah, this python is unchained.

121
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,139
It would be said that one is
incomes with the starting point.

122
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,439
Imbecile!

123
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,420
If you had not clung behind
engine of Waver, one would not be there!

124
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,619
Afflicted! Afflicted!

125
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,459
Everyone is outside now!

126
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,809
They left us behind!

127
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,999
It is your fault!

128
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,219
No the problem!

129
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,249
One does what now?

130
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,419
Let us see seeing…

131
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,720
Let us find its bottom
and let us leave with the excrement!

132
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,330
It IS OUT OF THE QUESTION WHICH I MAKE THAT!

133
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,919
Oh, the horse.

134
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,230
It is a bird!

135
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,760
You want that you above are assembled?

136
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
The BIRD IS TRANFORMÉ IN HORSE!

137
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,480
ITS ARMS SE ARE LENGTHENED!!

138
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,389
I ate the fruit Gomu Gomu and
I became an elastic man.

139
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,300
Of course that my arms lengthen.

140
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,059
Be to you what?!

141
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,309
A pirate.

142
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,800
He, one goes there.

143
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,880
Be held well.

144
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,149
Go!

145
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,900
It is time to leave from here!

146
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,199
Ahead, horse!

147
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,570
Take us along towards the exit
as quickly as you can!

148
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,190
Thank you, Odd Knight.

149
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,280
Fortunately, here, it
ground is made clouds.

150
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,019
Luffy and Aisa remained behind.

151
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,279
I hope that they are well.

152
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,399
IEA confidence as a Pierre.

153
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,000
He will deal with them, that he
that is to say a bird or a horse.

154
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,039
He, where are we?

155
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,959
It would be said that we are not
far from where we were presently.

156
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,189
But I am unaware of completely
where we are.

157
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,300
Which is this place?

158
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,620
Thank you.

159
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,760
To say that such a place
existed in Upper Yard…

160
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,109
Would this be?

161
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,700
This is…

162
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,599
our…

163
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,950
native Shandia ground?

164
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,360
Let us relight the flame of Shandora!

165
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,980
In the name of the Large Karugara Warrior!

166
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,790
Let us relight the flame of Shandora!

167
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,080
Our terre natale…

168
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,190
will be recovered!

169
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,790
It is the place which we seek.

170
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,160
The city that our ancestors
protected with pride!

171
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,460
Shandora!

172
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,520
It would be said that he seeks something.

173
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,510
What Luffy is
still making?

174
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,050
The python acts oddly.

175
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,430
He cries?

176
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,240
That there is,
Master of the Skies?

177
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,020
Why you are agitated like that?

178
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,040
Poor snake.

179
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,000
You are stupid!

180
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,950
[Note:god norse of the thunder]

181
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,589
Aisa!

182
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,469
Whore!

183
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,019
Nami!

184
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,330
I can nothing make for it!

185
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,419
Hein? Zoro?

186
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,830
And Robin?

187
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,319
You are there?!

188
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,629
When you are
exit of its stomach?!

189
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,240
Madam Navigatrice, which do you make there?

190
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,320
I am well.

191
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,000
But the snake…

192
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,580
Luffy is always inside.

193
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,339
But what it
fout in it?

194
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,960
How you want that I it
knows?! It was inside!

195
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,389
Brothel.

196
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,730
I bet that all that is because of him!
Why it is necessary always that it does that?!

197
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,960
What I know some?!

198
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,320
A blow…

199
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,749
After all these shootings of bazooka…

200
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,670
The Master of the Skies
was hardly wounded!

201
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,080
Whore! This attack
had to wound Aisa too!

202
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,860
Swell of Cloud!

203
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,820
Eneru!

204
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,799
What do you make?

205
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,319
You have the well hung language,

206
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,260
Wiper warrior.

207
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,520
Whereas I had generosity
to invite you on your terre natale.

208
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,419
Control your anger.

209
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,200
Wait still a little.

210
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,360
The play is not finished yet.

211
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,230
Play?

212
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,819
Yes.

213
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,759
An innocent little game.

214
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,160
You and others behind
in be the competitors.

215
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,040
Welcome with you, courageous survivors.

216
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,480
I congratulate you to be
arrived up to now.

217
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,959
That there
does it have?

218
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,029
I wanted just to amuse me a little.

219
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,400
Three hours after your
arrival on this island,

220
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,100
There will remain only one
handle of the 81 people.

221
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,469
It is the play of Survival.

222
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,680
Me included.

223
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,540
Some arrived later that
the others but I also counted them.

224
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,910
I had predicted that it there
would have that 5 survivors.

225
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,599
Five?

226
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,420
Zoro, Robin, Odd Knight,
the man with the bazooka, and Eneru…

227
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,840
Ca makes five!

228
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,279
Brilliant. He did not see me.

229
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,630
In three minutes, these
three hours will be expired.

230
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,570
What wants to say that it is not
finished as long as there will remain 6 people.

231
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,180
Shit! It knows!

232
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,940
The prophecy of God must
to achieve itself. It is inevitable.

233
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,120
Then now, which will disappear?

234
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,620
Will you fight between you?

235
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,470
Or perhaps I must
to choose myself?

236
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,269
What do you think about it?

237
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,949
I want any of it.

238
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,309
One is two.

239
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,270
I also refuse.

240
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,420
I made my decision.

241
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,160
He, wait! I…

242
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,760
YOU will disappear.

243
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,750
That of insolence.

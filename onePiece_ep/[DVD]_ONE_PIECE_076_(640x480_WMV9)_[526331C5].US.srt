1
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:28,110
Fatal counter-attack!

2
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:28,110
The sharp spirit of Usopp and Kaenboshi!

3
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,460
We are there!

4
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,360
I see!

5
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,660
It is the second island of Large Line,

6
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,080
Little Garden!

7
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,200
What is this it is that this island?

8
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,690
Reads… Little Garden?

9
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,400
This island…

10
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,810
What “does Little” want to say?

11
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,150
Ca must be one of these prehistoric islands.

12
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,640
They remained at the age of the dinosaurs.

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Our duel has lasted for 100 years.

14
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,910
Reason?

15
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,240
I forgot.

16
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,570
But it is not the problem.

17
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,310
Then, why do you fight?

18
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,340
For the honor!

19
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,130
Ouahou! They are enormous!

20
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,650
God of the war…

21
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,110
Elbaf, God of the war

22
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,610
its judgment returned!

23
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,810
I lost his favors.

24
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,220
Who did that?

25
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,350
You show!!

26
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,730
you are those which ruined the duel of the Giants-Ossans.

27
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,200
I go you botter the bottom!!

28
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,580
It is useless!

29
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:24,350
Your companions will become my next masterpiece!

30
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,750
Luffy!!

31
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,170
Ah… This tea is very good.

32
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,360
Luffy!

33
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
What you…

34
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,190
This tea is so good.

35
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,880
Luffy!

36
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,060
What you insane?

37
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,320
Species of cretin!!

38
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,850
It is the end of the history for you, the balls.

39
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,400
You will test my best weapon!

40
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,170
What a cretin! he missed his target and struck his own comrade!

41
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,080
I did not see any ball!

42
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,690
Did I forget to say to you that my breath is explosive?

43
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,210
Shit.

44
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,010
It is too…

45
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,410
Not balls…

46
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,090
Karu!

47
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,510
Does Ca go?

48
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,690
Do He, you leave itself there over there?

49
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,710
Yes, I am there! Thank you!

50
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,780
Its last attack burned its Tee-shirt and destroyed the trap!

51
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,060
You will not control me any more with your odd painting now!

52
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,320
I will not let any of them die!

53
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,320
I am really irritated now!

54
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,590
Hold, it is really odd…

55
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,580
Ca makes hours that I wait and nobody still returned.

56
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,430
Something had to arrive at Nami-San or Vivi-Chan.

57
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,760
If it is the case, it is really not the moment to cook the lizard!

58
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,100
Namiii-San!

59
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,690
Vivi-Chann!

60
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,320
He! Said something!

61
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,150
I love you!

62
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,840
What is it that?

63
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,230
While you made the idiot,
your companions were already reduced to that.

64
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,900
And then?

65
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,090
They are always alive!

66
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,070
Eh well, that I do not know it.

67
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,600
After Miss Week Golden delicious painted them,

68
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,990
they will be perfect wax statues.

69
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,330
It is too late to save them, Straw hat!

70
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,410
Indeed, it is right!

71
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,590
It is well too late.

72
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,430
Now, taste infinite despair

73
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,840
of my attack.

74
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,630
What does it make?

75
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,020
It is what is worth the 42.000.000 Berrys on its head.

76
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,440
The ultimate masterpiece of Mr. 3…

77
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,230
Now, Miss Week Golden delicious!

78
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,750
Recover to me your adorable colors

79
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,600
in an artistic way.

80
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,520
After will I be able to make a pause?

81
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,690
If you want, but do not remain in the way.

82
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,990
In this state, I am completely invincible!

83
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,530
My splendid wax Doru Doru is as hard as of steel.

84
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,850
My whole body is protected by an unbreakable armor!

85
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,450
Therefore, I do not have…

86
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,390
no weakness!!

87
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,890
Too much cool!

88
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,860
Does not admire it!

89
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,390
Engagements it!

90
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,330
Well!

91
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,850
Coat of color finished!

92
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:21,770
Now…

93
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,090
Useless!

94
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,080
Ca did not go!

95
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,710
Its attacks cannot penetrate its solid armor!

96
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Shit, vapor of wax…

97
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,640
Of wax?

98
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,630
I see!

99
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,280
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

100
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,160
If the wax vaporizes,

101
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,040
it can be molten!

102
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,210
Luffy!

103
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,860
You must ignite his wax!

104
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,430
Whatever its solidity, it is only of wax!

105
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,960
Even if Zoro, the others and main Brogy already hardened, it is still time!

106
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,200
One can save them!

107
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:31,950
What?

108
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,820
It is true?

109
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,310
Yes, it rightly.

110
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,040
How can you say that to them?

111
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,970
Of course, the knowledge does not make any difference!

112
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,400
You have neither the chance, nor time!

113
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,570
In 30 small seconds, their hearts will stop beating!

114
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,370
Even now, they test pain and anguish during their last breath of conscience!

115
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,960
They taste the horror of death!

116
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,890
We do not need 30 seconds, I will save them now!

117
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,970
Usopp!

118
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,110
You do not listen to it?
You are not likely any to gain.

119
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,010
Shit! We do not have any more time!

120
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,670
Give up!

121
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,440
Listen, this cord…

122
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,680
Oh! Ca with the funny air!

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,540
With what did think you?

124
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,540
You let me go up above?

125
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:49,860
Karu!

126
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,930
Course!

127
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,520
Course!!

128
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,000
No matter what it arrives, continues to run around the base!

129
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,560
Whatever your plan, it is useless!

130
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,400
Excuse me…

131
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,430
I wonder how much kilos you will be able to support!

132
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,690
Always upright? Dirtiness of bird!

133
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,860
Give up!

134
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Give up!

135
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,300
They will be my adorable chief-of works!

136
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,760
You think that I will let do that?

137
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,930
They will not die because of a guy like you!

138
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,350
If one needs fire to melt it, I will use that one!

139
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,170
Not! Stop!

140
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,180
Luffy!

141
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,800
This small flame will not make them melt rather quickly!

142
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,120
Light the cord of Karu!

143
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,890
The cord of the bird?

144
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,800
It soaked in oil.

145
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,590
It is a special cord!

146
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,630
Ok! Everyone awakes!

147
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,220
The situation will be heated a hair.
Try to adapt to you.

148
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,400
Stop!

149
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,130
Hot! Hot!

150
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,970
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

151
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,680
Enormous this fire!

152
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,100
They will be left there?

153
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,580
Not! Cursed Straw hat!

154
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,790
How did you can ruin my Candle Service Set?

155
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,510
I will not forgive myself it!

156
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,280
You will not flee, band of cowards!

157
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Shit!

158
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,390
Bandage the small bastard ones!

159
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,460
Now, you did it!

160
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,570
It is the end!

161
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,800
And now,

162
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,820
I will burst you the head!

163
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,200
Oh not!

164
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,400
It was hot in it!
It is all that you could do?

165
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,230
Which kind of luxury did expect you?

166
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,840
You should thank me for being in life!

167
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,000
You are right! Thank you!

168
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,460
I cannot believe it!

169
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,310
We are in life!

170
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,540
You dissolved wax, what a wound!

171
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,540
But I will not let to you any more interfere in the mission!

172
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Mr. 5!

173
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,030
Cretin!

174
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,000
How much time should I prove it to you?

175
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,030
The powder does not go on man-bends!

176
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,740
Which taste that has?

177
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,370
Afflicted, but I am a liar!

178
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,720
It is not powder in your mouth. It is my special Tabasco Boshi!

179
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,800
Ca burns!

180
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,400
Would be sure to know before speaking!

181
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,300
Pirate poor wretch!

182
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,040
How oses you to try this trick rotted on me?

183
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,710
I go you éradiquer with my Full Body Explosion!

184
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,830
You will be less than powder of bone when I finish some!

185
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,920
Not! Stop! Not!

186
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,610
Usopp!

187
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,880
Wait! Not!
I am sorry! Afflicted…

188
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,250
My katanas is well when they are ignited.

189
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,120
Zoro!

190
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,660
Yo! It would be said that one leaves oneself there.

191
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,660
Ouais!

192
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,450
Master…

193
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,380
There remain about it still two.

194
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,090
Bird!

195
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,810
One will not forgive them!

196
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,850
That which destroys a duel is not a man!

197
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,250
Therefore, you came!

198
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,580
Welcome in my castle Doru Doru!

199
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,030
It is what that?

200
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,930
And now, I wonder whether you can say where I am?

201
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,920
You were not malignant to follow us.

202
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,310
We are the most intelligent combo of Works Baroque.

203
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,860
A surpuissant idiot who walks only to the instinct like you

204
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,350
cannot hope to overcome us.

205
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,550
I am Mr. 3.

206
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,890
And I always finish my missions.

207
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,200
Please, thus advance!

208
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,520
But if you turn me the back,

209
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,530
your heart…

210
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,660
will be transpierced at this precise moment.

211
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,570
How…

212
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,980
you knew

213
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,830
which I was?

214
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,760
Instinct.

215
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,610
For the tea of the afternoon,
Earl Grey is really the best.

216
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,140
He, wait a little!

217
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,850
I should not be here sitted with drinking tea by making manners!

218
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,110
Nami-san and the others must await my assistance!

219
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,430
Ah, what a embarrassment!

220
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,040
But I wonder really what such a place of comfort in this jungle does?

221
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,000
Hein?

222
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,490
It is Den Den Mushi.

223
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,490
Den Den Mushi = Snail Phon

224
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,800
Yes? Thank you to have called!

225
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,950
It is the restaurant of shit!

226
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,580
You order something?

227
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,520
Stop talking cock,

228
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:29,980
asshole!

229
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,430
Your report/ratio is late.

230
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,480
Ah? My report/ratio?

231
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,410
And I with whom do I have can know the honor?

232
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,500
It is me.

233
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,790
Mr. 0!

1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,720
Everything they do is pretty interesting.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,500
A sane person would never do anything against this island.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,400
Giants!

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,970
Behold, Chimney.

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,490
Whether they die or survive in the end,

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,750
striving to achieve what nobody in the past
 hundreds years was able to do...

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,580
This incident will astound everyone in the world.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,640
Once this battle is over,

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,230
that Straw Hat brat's name will

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,960
roar throughout the whole world!

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,980
ROBIIIIN!!!

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,620
He's here!

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,410
Luffy...

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,880
I CAME TO BRING YOU BACK!!!

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,360
Chief-dono!

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,610
On the roof of the Courthouse,

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,450
a man wearing a straw hat is shouting toward us!

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,940
He is without any mistake the crew's leader!

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,500
He is Straw Hat Luffy!

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,430
Don't be stupid!

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,760
When I looked just now, Blueno was on the rooftop!

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,470
Wasn't he keeping guard, that foolish incompetent!?

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,890
What is he doing at such an important time!?

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,650
I rampaged around a lot...

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,790
I'm starving!

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,210
For that kind of situation...

27
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,690
My lunch!!

28
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,910
I'm gwad I swaved those...!

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,000
Yummy, yummy!

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
So it's him...

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Straw Hat Luffy...

32
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,680
What the hell is happening...?

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,430
What in the world is Blueno doi-

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,390
No way...

35
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,800
This can't be...!

36
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,750
He's one of the CP9...

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,010
A Rokushiki and a Devil fruit user...

38
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,700
The superhuman Blueno with over than 800 douriki is...

39
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,270
Alright!

40
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,580
My strenght's restored!
["I'm reviving"]

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,570
Yet, he lost to...

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,130
That little brat?

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,450
Ch-Chief!

44
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,760
How should we proceed?

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,640
Lucchi...

46
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,550
Where is Lucchi?

47
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,550
Call Lucchi and the others!

48
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,860
Gather them all here!

49
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,210
Immediatly give CP9 the other to

50
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,240
completly wipe out Straw Hat Luffy and his crew!

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:39,910
Y-Yes!

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,730
Right now!

53
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,480
And tell this to Baskerville!

54
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,610
"If by any chance you let the pirates do something as lowering the drawbridge,

55
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,270
I'll send all of your three heads flying!"

56
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,090
Yes!

57
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,070
Lift up your face, Nico Robin.

58
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,260
These guys finally came this far.

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:01,870
Oi...

60
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,890
This is an extreme thing to do.

61
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,570
I already understood the fact that

62
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,090
you accepted the government's conditions and got taken away for your nakama's sake.

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,190
But that agreement was

64
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,850
shamelessly broken by that idiot chief just now.

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,080
Even if you let them capture you obediently

66
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,560
doesn't mean you'll save anyone from now on.

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,050
There shouldn't be any way for you

68
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,830
other accepting their rescue and getting out of here.

69
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,330
Yet...

70
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,250
Aren't you making quite a grim face?

71
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,870
It's just as if you are still running away from something by yourself...

72
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,070
Are you scared that your nakama will die here?

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,650
If you look away,

74
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,970
they won't be able to save you.

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,260
Oi!!

76
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,850
Is there someone in there!?

77
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,230
From now, I will...

78
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,730
Make you meet with Straw Hat!

79
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:13,380
Answer, Robin! 
The Straw Hat crew's outcry!!

80
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,550
Listen up, bunch of fools!

81
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,250
We gotta take Nico Robin away from Straw Hat urgently!

82
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,310
We are heading to the Gates of Justice immediatly!

83
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,790
Bring those two!!

84
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,590
Ch... Chief-dono!

85
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,940
It's alright, so won't you hurry for once!?

86
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,140
But...

87
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,470
Franky's ass is inflating!!

88
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,200
What the hell is that!?

89
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh, Spanda.

90
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,640
I perceived my own life's end...

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
And chosed the path of self-destruction instead.

92
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,770
What!?

93
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,540
At least I'll take all of you down with me...

94
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,370
IDIOT!

95
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,950
Idiot, wait!

96
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,660
With a giant explosion of a 3 kilometres diameter...

97
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,510
I'm gonna close the curtain on my existence... Don't try to stop me!

98
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,500
STOP IT!

99
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,460
Save me!

100
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,930
Don't involve me in this!

101
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,920
Three...

102
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,570
Two...

103
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,990
Damn! I can't die here!

104
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,740
One!

105
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,430
STOP IT!!

106
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,250
Let's go, Nico Robin!

107
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,100
Coup de boo
[boo=sound of fart in japanese]

108
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,960
Alright, the chains got broken too!

109
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,750
We're gonna fall!

110
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,690
Super!

111
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,090
That was close...

112
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,020
Good thing there was a fence...

113
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,790
Yo, you're not hurt, right?

114
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,970
If I had another bottle of Cola,

115
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,190
I could have taken us to the other side with another Coup de Vent...

116
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,240
Maa, it's alright.

117
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,790
Straw Hat is there.

118
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,040
Now, answer him properly.

119
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,690
We got tricked!

120
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,640
Chief!

121
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,600
Franky and Robin broke their chains and ran to the balcony!

122
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,350
Idiots, what are you doing!?

123
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,630
Capture them immediately!

124
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,500
If you let them go, I'll make sure all of you get hanged!

125
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,240
Robin!

126
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,390
I'm glad!

127
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,860
So you were still there!

128
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,640
Luffy...

129
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,150
Capture them once again!

130
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,630
Don't ever let them get away!

131
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,280
You small fry get outta the way!

132
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,500
Weapons left!

133
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,610
Looks like Franky is in there too.

134
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,570
Alright!

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Wait for me there!

136
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,170
It's far, but I'll try to jump!

137
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,890
Gomu gomu no

138
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,490
WAIT!!

139
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,340
I told you countless times.

140
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,380
I won't...

141
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,920
Come back to you anymore!

142
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,440
Go back!

143
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,630
I don't even want to see your faces anymore!

144
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,800
Why did you come to rescue me!?

145
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,690
Why did you come to rescue me...?

146
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,340
I didn't wish for such a thing...!

147
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,930
When did I ask you to save me!?

148
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,540
I only...

149
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,450
Want to die!!

150
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,170
Interesting!

151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,590
What are those guys doing?

152
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,890
What the heck are you planning to do!?

153
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,600
They came this far by risking their lives!

154
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,500
Yet, you are...!

155
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,170
That's something they did on their own.

156
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,150
What did you say!?

157
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,300
Don't mess with-

158
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,640
You're in the way.

159
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,920
Kaku, you just did that to relieve your frustration, right!?

160
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,570
Frustration for eating that weird fruit!

161
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,780
You're hella noisy.

162
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,170
I like it.

163
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,680
Oh? The enemy is Straw Hat alone?

164
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,940
Yoyoi!

165
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,510
Even if he's alone, it's admirable to have come this far!

166
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,960
That's right, Blueno got beaten up.

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,000
That idiot!

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,470
As I though, he lost his touch after spending 5 years as a bar owner.

169
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,570
Even if he did, was it enough to lose...?

170
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,190
He lost!

171
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,670
Chapapa!

172
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,680
Alright! It's great you gathered up, CP9!

173
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,760
But let's wait a little bit,

174
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,580
the Straw Hat crew just started crumbling on itself!!

175
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,030
Let's watch this!

176
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,750
This is of the most interesting!

177
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,980
That's the spirit, Yokozuna!

178
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,920
Keep it up!

179
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,700
Guilty!

180
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,920
Guilty!

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,820
The Guilty Jury!

182
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,270
Move aside.

183
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,210
We'll make a verdict on that frog's crime.

184
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,190
Guilty!

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,680
Guilty!

186
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,530
What are those guys?

187
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,910
Guilty!

188
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,060
Guilty!!

189
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,590
Let's go, Chopper!

190
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,300
Forget that!

191
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,850
Go, Chopper!

192
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,650
Me alone?

193
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,320
I never knew there was such a thing

194
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,940
as a Judge on this island.

195
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,650
I heard that all of those who are taken to Enies Lobby are considered criminals.

196
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,540
And then, all they can do is pass through an empty Courthouse.

197
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,420
That's a mistake, pirate.

198
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,880
This is an impartial Courthouse whose authority is unequaled in the world.

199
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,620
The trial punishes people fairly.

200
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,130
However!

201
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,310
The Jury deciding whether the suspect is guilty or innocent here

202
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,700
is formed of criminals once condemned to death!

203
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,660
Their only hope is to drag all of you down with them!

204
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,310
Former criminals once condemned to death!?

205
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,360
Because of this, in this city there was

206
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,950
never

207
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,660
a sole innocence verdict in the past!

208
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,680
Kiwi!

209
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,070
Guys!

210
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,210
Guilty!

211
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,640
Guilty!

212
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,070
Shit, those guys...!

213
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,670
Don't falter over this!

214
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,580
If we don't get past this place,

215
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,310
we won't be able to lower the drawbridge!

216
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,360
We entrusted aniki to Straw Hat!

217
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,650
This isn't the time for us to be pulling their leg in such a place!

218
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,760
Yokozuna!

219
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,620
You stood to that steel ball's blows countless times!

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,560
SCREW THIS!!

221
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,230
Just give up!

222
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,980
There are still over six thousands soldiers!

223
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,190
Saa, let's invade the Courthouse!

224
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,990
Bring down the pirates!

225
00:14:59,290 --> 00:14:59,960
What happened?

226
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,390
Why are the giants there...?

227
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,500
Frog?

228
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,090
Tell me the situation!

229
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,790
You're the guy who was with Straw Hat-san...

230
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,780
What's happening?

231
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,290
To have stopped this huge amount of soldiers...

232
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,580
Yeah, he's one resistant frog!

233
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,700
Where are the other guys...?

234
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,790
They got lost again...

235
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,500
We don't have much time too...

236
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,860
That's right...

237
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,790
As long as I go up, I can use anything.

238
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,780
Tatsumaki!

239
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,010
Eh, what?

240
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,810
This place is dangerous as well!

241
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,560
I knew it, all of you aren't normal people!

242
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,230
To have giants follow you,

243
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,890
you're a fearsome man!

244
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,510
No...

245
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,320
Oh, that's right, all of your nakama went to the rooftop.

246
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,210
The rooftop?

247
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,280
Hurry up too!

248
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,890
King of the Snipers,

249
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,460
leave that to me!

250
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,360
You want to die?

251
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,300
That's right.

252
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,570
Say, Chief...

253
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,650
Shouldn't we just go down there, annihilate that thing, and it'd be the end of the story?

254
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,860
Maa, hold on.

255
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,330
A captain who risked everything and came this far to rescue his nakama,

256
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,310
yet get his efforts to save her rejected at the very end.

257
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,530
Have you...

258
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,110
Ever seen such an interesting spectacle?

259
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,700
ROBIN!!

260
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,490
DON'T DIE!

261
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,010
Listen to his desesperate shouting!

262
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,830
I wonder what kind of expression he's...

263
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,730
What are you babbling about?

264
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,560
H-He's picking his nose!

265
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
You know, Robin...

266
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,370
We already came this far...

267
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,580
Anyway, we're gonna save you.

268
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,260
Landed well!

269
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,670
And then, if you still want to die...

270
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,730
Die after we've saved you.

271
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,690
Ouch...

272
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,980
You're alright, Chopper?

273
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,560
Yeah, I'm fine.

274
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,500
But I wonder what was that thing just now.

275
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,560
I can somewhat imagine what happened...

276
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,910
I should have climbed up this way from the start.

277
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:19,700
Zoro!

278
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,390
I knew it was you!

279
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
We were lucky it was only the after-effect!

280
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,500
We would have died if we'd been in the center of that goddamn technique!

281
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,380
What's wrong with you two?

282
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,470
Dash!

283
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,860
Shishinabe shoot!

284
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm certainly the first one here...

285
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,630
Saa, Robin-chan, sorry to have kept you waiting!

286
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,130
I will come save...

287
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,790
Marimo!!

288
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,610
Why the hell did you get here before me!?

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,600
Ah, you're pretty late.

290
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,960
Did you get lost?

291
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,080
[nothing to translate there, just wanted to point out how Sanji is losing all his means in front of zoro xD and look at that pose ;3)

292
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,280
Where did you learn that freaking word!?

293
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Sogeking!

294
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,870
He's flying in the sky!

295
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,690
Awesome!!

296
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,020
Where was he and what was he doing?

297
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,200
I wonder if he'll land safely...

298
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,770
One after another...

299
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,950
Yoyoi!

300
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,030
In any case...

301
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,480
Sogeking!

302
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,320
To think they'd come up there...

303
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,560
Even if they're the enemy, this is praiseworthy, praiseworthy!

304
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,380
Pi... Pi-pirates, so many of them...!

305
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,360
I'll request this from you, Robin!

306
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,480
Whether you wanna die or not,

307
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,590
I don't care about whatever you say!

308
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,940
Say that kind of thing

309
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,810
when you'll be at our sides!

310
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,930
That's right, Robin-chwan!

311
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,250
Robin, come back!!

312
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,780
Oi, Sogeking.

313
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,470
Can you stand?

314
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,570
Of course.

315
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,020
Such a little won't stop me...

316
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't worry, I'm alright.

317
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,780
Leave the rest to us!!

318
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,660
You tako-pirates!!

319
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,050
If you value your lives, escape while you can!!

320
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,300
I have strenght!

321
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,490
Could it be...

322
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,370
That's right!

323
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,610
I hold the power who eradicted your homeland Ohara 20 years ago...

324
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
The Buster Call!

325
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,140
Stop it! Nothing but that!

326
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,800
Next time, One Piece: Robin's past! The girl who was called a demon!

327
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,920
I will become the pirate king!

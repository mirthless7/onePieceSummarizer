1
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,950
The new clandestine ones
have just arrived.

2
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,000
A crew of seven individuals coming from
Blue sea at summer announced by the Amazon old woman.

3
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,030
Seven individuals coming from the Blue Sea…

4
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,850
He speaks about us?!

5
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
Company, halt!

6
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,959
Heso!

7
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,799
Heso.

8
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,170
Hello. Heso.

9
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,650
Brothel, but of what
you speak, the guy?!

10
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,540
You are the seven clandestine ones
originating in the Blue Sea, isn't this?

11
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,520
We are here for you
to inflict the Celestial Judgment!

12
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,780
The clandestine ones?!

13
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:07,370
Already criminals?!
Guards of the law of Skypiea

14
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,579
The clandestine ones?

15
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,529
Does Ca want to say what?

16
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,540
This E-is that
it is true?

17
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,300
Useless to deny it.

18
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,820
The guardian of the Door of the Paradise, Amazon,

19
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,720
we sent these photographs, taken with its Visio-Dial.

20
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,689
Not! It is not possible!

21
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,279
There must be error,
McKinley captain!

22
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,970
They are not criminals!

23
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,870
Why it us
draft the clandestine ones?

24
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,950
Surely the tax…

25
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,239
from 1 billion Extols each one
that we were supposed to pay.

26
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,229
We did not pay it.

27
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,260
But, this old said
that one could pass without paying.

28
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,439
It is true!

29
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,420
Ca is not used for nothing.

30
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,279
Please, not of excuses.

31
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,530
Acknowledge simply your faults.

32
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,490
However, there is not
not place to worry.

33
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,120
The clandestine entry,

34
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,330
is a minor offense of class 11,
being able to be punished by the Celestial Judgment.

35
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,949
Once your received sorrow,

36
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,250
you will receive the statute
simple tourists.

37
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,529
Then, why you
did not say it earlier?

38
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,050
I by of still delighted not,
but which is this punishment?

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,659
It is very simple.

40
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,360
You must pay ten times
the amount of the import duty.

41
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,019
If you pay this tax immediately,

42
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,060
you will be discharged at once.

43
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,399
10 billion Extols per anybody.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,320
Ca thus makes 70 billion
of Extols for every Sept.

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,939
70 billion Extols?

46
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,620
C-Combien that made Extol in Berry?!

47
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,759
Berry.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,559
The currency of the Sea
Blue, isn't this?

49
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,779
I think that 10.000
Extols are worth 1 Berry.

50
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,769
If ten thousand Extols
make 1 Berry, then…

51
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,279
1,10,100,1 000,10
000,100 000,1 000.000…

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,759
Ahh, how much that made?

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,380
If it is the case, 70 billion Extols
7 million Berrys would be worth.

54
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,579
It is too much!

55
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,810
I could buy
tonnes of rice with that!

56
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,310
Why would be necessary to pay a similar sum
after having risked our lives to arrive here?!

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,789
It is inadmissible!

58
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,729
What you known as?

59
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,300
You had only to pay the tax
of immigration of 700.000 berrys at the entry.

60
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Ca remains too expensive!

61
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,310
Will know that we others, the White Berets, we act under the direct orders of the priests.

62
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,879
Your refusal to cooperate
your case will worsen.

63
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,799
They is good, that is enough.
Let us drop them.

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,709
In any case…

65
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,779
I worry about what could arrive at
Nami-san if we do not find it soon.

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,429
If that is, she cries all them
tears of its body in this moment even!

67
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,429
Yes, allons-y!

68
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,530
It is not it which interests you!

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,360
The types of presently knew
that we were on the celestial island.

70
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,279
It had to arrive some
thing with Luffy and the others!

71
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,300
I must make quickly!

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,229
Ok!

73
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,219
Since the wind turned,

74
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,149
let us leave to the adventure!

75
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,919
Not, I want to say will seek Nami!

76
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,519
He, Ho, Luffy!

77
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,370
Q-that is what y' has, Usopp?

78
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,579
Remain Zen!

79
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,699
Calm yourself!

80
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,190
With tweezers…

81
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,590
Ben, if Nami is right part
to walk, it should soon return.

82
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,699
One will miss it if one leaves now.

83
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,569
To walk?

84
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,770
It left too a long time
for a simple walk.

85
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,059
You include/understand?!

86
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,500
Luffy uses right Nami like pretexts for
to go to venture in the Field of God!

87
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,500
Over there?!

88
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,529
Indeed.

89
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,519
He decided to go there.

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,889
Exactly. it is well what I say!

91
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,210
She said that to attract anger
of would God be terrible, not true?

92
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,570
What is necessary to make then?

93
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,170
Let us avoid having additional troubles
and let us await the return of Nami!

94
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,719
One speaks about Nami there!

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,570
She probably has 7 million
of Berrys to be lent to us!

96
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,630
Not! I am certain that it has them!

97
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,240
About what did speak you at the moment?

98
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,650
Ca returns to me… If one of
clandestine is untraceable…

99
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,770
… they will be treated like
fugitive criminals.

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,439
Have-HAVE-await!
Wait one second!

101
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,689
It will be soon of return!

102
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,049
You then will be able
to pay the entire amount!

103
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,929
You will see, we are reasonable!

104
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,480
You in ridges not and have patience!

105
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,229
Listen, Luffy! Do not make
silly things or you will put Nami in anger!

106
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,040
You ace included/understood? They is good
? Wait simply!

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,719
Just a little bit.

108
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,689
Sanji, you too.

109
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,420
Ouais.

110
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,609
Go, everyone takes
a pause for the moment!

111
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,149
Agree you to take
tea, Robin-chan?

112
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,020
With pleasure.

113
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,000
All goes well for the moment…

114
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,820
He, Chopper! Ca you
would say to go to fish?

115
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,709
Ouais, they would be super!

116
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,649
Conis, is there a place where
one could fish in the corner?

117
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,450
Yes, close to here. I
will lead you to it.

118
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,919
Make quickly and repairs it!

119
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,890
Delay me to lead it!

120
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,220
Oh!

121
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,709
This Waver… with the air to be broken.

122
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,180
If you are responsible,
it is a crime of Class 10.

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,820
It is about degradation of the material of the celestial island by inhabitants of the Blue Sea.

124
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,179
At all! I am sorry.

125
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,629
It belongs to them in fact.

126
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,330
It is true! It is mine!

127
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,830
Theirs?

128
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,869
It is rather suspect.

129
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,499
There should not be
of Waver on the Blue Sea.

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,430
If this one were stolen on the island
celestial, then it is a crime of class…

131
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,630
Close maintaining it! Or
I break you the mouth!

132
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,330
To break me the mouth…?

133
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,189
V you did not understand anything!

134
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,280
It is you who ace wrong, Luffy!

135
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,149
Poor wretches inhabitants of the Blue Sea…

136
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,789
You dare to insult the White Berets.

137
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,400
Imbeciles.

138
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,589
One is better here.

139
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,340
These armchairs are so marrowy.

140
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,939
It is enormous that one…!

141
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,409
Does not let it flee, Usopp!

142
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,799
It is about to flee!

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,090
Quickly, Luffy!

144
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,790
Oh! Leave it to me!

145
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,770
IT IS ENORMOUS!

146
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,850
Is brothel, it what that?

147
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,059
Still funny of fish…

148
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,699
It with failed to devour Conis!

149
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,389
It is another type of celestial fish?

150
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,060
Ah, excuse me.

151
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,690
I thank you for the bottom of
heart to have saved Conis-san.

152
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,410
Father, this fish…

153
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,849
It is even more worrying…

154
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,270
Let us go, go.

155
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,450
This celestial fish is a species
rare. Its capture is prohibited.

156
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,389
You violated the law of
protection of the rare species!

157
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,679
This is a crime of class 9!

158
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,279
In what this is a crime?!

159
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,610
Zoro saved the life of Conis!

160
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,529
Did Zoro, you complete it?

161
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,609
I used the dish of my saber.

162
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,719
Ah, so much better!

163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,280
If it is slackened,
is the incident closed, not?

164
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,369
Perfect!

165
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,330
Look at! It with the air in form!

166
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,889
Ca with the good air!

167
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,159
Have-await, Luffy! Do not do that!

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,510
Not!

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,140
You cannot deny
to have tried to eat it!

170
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,430
Robbery attempt, this
is a crime of class 8!

171
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,439
It is too hard!
I am not able to eat it!

172
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,529
Ca is enough!

173
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,249
Release, Luffy!

174
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,289
He, celestial fish! turn over to
water before making you puff out!

175
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,950
You are free to leave!

176
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,060
Ca makes me shit to remain here to be listened
this type with its conneries on the crimes.

177
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,689
If it does not close it…!

178
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,099
Wait! Wait, Zoro
! Do not ignite you!

179
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,230
Your attitude is rather threatening.

180
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,010
Such a behavior is
liable to a crime of class 7!

181
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,419
It was not at all a threat!

182
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,530
Zoro wanted just to say “that
is enough or I explode to laugh. “

183
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,989
It was a joke!

184
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,640
A gag! A gag!

185
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,629
It is equivocal all that!

186
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,190
It tries to return to us guilty!

187
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,530
Chopper!

188
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,519
Do not complicate the situation!

189
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,159
But, one can nothing make
with them in our legs!

190
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,399
One can nothing make?

191
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,679
I included/understood!

192
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,629
It would be necessary anything to make
! Let us make a nap!

193
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,630
Let us do a whole a nap!

194
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,620
To dare to break the quietude of Angel
Beach of a noise if insulting…

195
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,580
You are guilty of
environmental pollution.

196
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,329
You have just added a crime
of Class 6 with your case!

197
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,450
He! One cannot even whirr?

198
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,679
Ahh, it is what it is delirious?!

199
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,619
I will smash to him
the mug with this old man!

200
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,499
One goes there?

201
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,589
Have-await!

202
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,940
He, remains here!

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,729
Ca fears!

204
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,380
There is already world over there!

205
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,569
It is undoubtedly about
nakama of the types which I saw…

206
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,890
Please, made
nothing stupid, the guy!

207
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,889
You, Luffy, Zoro calm!

208
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,469
Measuring rod?

209
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,259
You know snails, not?

210
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,250
WAIT ONE MINUTE!!

211
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,660
Ah! Nami-san, you are healthy and safe!

212
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,330
Luffy, does not put them in anger!

213
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,609
But, this type is one…!

214
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,070
Nami! Use your money to pay
tax with immigration of 7 million Berrys!

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,390
Perfect! Then the problem
is solved if the fine is paid!

216
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,449
7 million Berrys…

217
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,440
It is…

218
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,010
What?!

219
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,300
… REALLY TOO EXPENSIVE!!

220
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,819
Thin!

221
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,209
In my anger for this sum
ridiculous, I have accidentally…!

222
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,010
He!

223
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
C-CAPITAINE!

224
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,389
Ah, Oji-san!

225
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,469
Thank you for Waver.
It was really amusing.

226
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,349
Not, of nothing. All my excuses.

227
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,339
There is more important, you are
in a rather delicate situation!

228
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,739
Captain!

229
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,349
Go, the guy, one sinks!

230
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,079
Why?! You do not finish
brawls that you launched?!

231
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,720
Better is worth not to oppose it
type that they call “God”!

232
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,619
Hold good!

233
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,239
How did one arrive from there there?

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,939
How did this arrive?

235
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,130
Captain…!

236
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,029
By the way, which type of crime
has it just made at the moment?

237
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,970
Apparently, an obstruction of
civil servant, a crime of Class 5.

238
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,229
Ouf! It is right a crime of Class 5.

239
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,460
They is not good!

240
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,199
If you make one
crime of Class 5…

241
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,670
Then in the name of Eneru God, you
will be condemned to the “drifting Cloud”.

242
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,009
The “drifting Cloud”?

243
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,889
It is what that?

244
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,670
The “drifting Cloud”, that with the cool air!

245
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,239
At all!

246
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,420
It is the capital punishment!

247
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,579
L IT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT?!

248
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,870
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

249
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,880
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

250
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,980
It is in apples.

251
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,990
But, a capital punishment with the Kingdom
of God, that appears a little excessive.

252
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,769
It is the truth!

253
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,080
It is what occurs!

254
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,300
The “drifting Cloud” consists with
to pose a boat on a celestial cloud.

255
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,030
It derives in the sky indefinitely,
until all the crew perished.

256
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,160
It is a capital punishment!

257
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,770
I see.

258
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,030
Then it is like that it
boat fell from a clear sky.

259
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,170
About what you do speak, Robin?

260
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,700
The galleon which is to us
fallen above, Bliss Feels it.

261
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,850
This boat perhaps underwent it
even leaves two hundred years earlier.

262
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,559
HE, BAND OF GOOD-FOR-NOTHINGS!

263
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,949
Summers you conscious of what
you made the Captain?!

264
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,039
What you ace say?

265
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,499
Ah! Sanji-kun, wait…

266
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,709
Yes, Nami-san!

267
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,529
Let us go, of made not a whole dish!

268
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,489
It was a simple reflex…

269
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,029
A REFLEX?!

270
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,909
Hum, how to say… involuntarily…

271
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,099
INVOLUNTARILY?!

272
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,779
Ah, it is that! You know…

273
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,269
It was right an accident…

274
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,200
ACCIDENT?! AN ACCIDENT?!

275
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,899
It is that, an accident!

276
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,219
All that was only one accident!

277
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,560
It is really hard of
to control Waver, not true?

278
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,080
It is the first time
that I test one of them.

279
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,369
The direction is very sensitive!

280
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,589
What a awkward I am!

281
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,629
The beginners would do better
to avoid the so difficult activities!

282
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,010
Would Ca be better, not?

283
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
You had fun to lead
this trick so easily.

284
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,249
He, Luffy!

285
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,700
Nami controls the situation with this
history of accident, then loop!

286
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,260
Ah, this Luffy! A thing
similar is impossible!

287
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,760
Good Ah?

288
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,929
Hum, excuse me.

289
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,950
It would be to better look after the Captain
McKinley as quickly as possible.

290
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,109
Still sorry.

291
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,449
C-C' TRUE EAST!

292
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,940
CAPTAIN MCKINLEY!

293
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,819
Let us install it at home then.

294
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,119
We appreciate your co-operation.

295
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,280
Heso!

296
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,689
You seven, remain here and do not move!

297
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,149
INCLUDED/UNDERSTOOD?!

298
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,240
Captain…!

299
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,090
They set out again while crawling…

300
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,880
Carry at least the guy!

301
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,690
I know that you are not
not criminals.

302
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,710
Then please,
return quickly on your premise!

303
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,090
H-He!

304
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,550
We should listen to it.

305
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,209
I saw it my own eyes!

306
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,060
An infested island of dangerous types!

307
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,050
Then you went on this
prohibited crowned ground.

308
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,999
The place where it is necessary especially
not to put the feet?

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,779
Dangerous types?

310
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,639
Not a word moreover!

311
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,330
Whether they are Gods or guerillas, I
am sure that they will cause us problems!

312
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,370
In any case, one
draw! Immediately!

313
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,789
To move away me from Conis-chan
break me the heart…

314
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,270
But if it is Nami-san which says it!

315
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,170
If we remain here, they
large troubles will have!

316
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,409
It rightly!

317
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,479
If they are shown to be our
accomplices, their life will be foutue!

318
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,850
Therefore, if we start from our characteristic
likings, we will not attract any more troubles to them

319
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,389
Of agreement?

320
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,029
Ok!

321
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,380
Let us return on our premises! Go!

322
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,400
What do you make, Luffy?

323
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,019
Why one flees?

324
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,499
Because we are in danger!

325
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,349
One is always in danger, not?

326
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,719
But there, we are not
not the only concerned ones.

327
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,170
They could be
decrees because of us!

328
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,950
But they did not do anything of evil.

329
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,090
It would not be right to stop them.

330
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,460
You are right, but…

331
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,120
Please… Made quickly…

332
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,030
They will not be able to go nowhere!

333
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,049
One will wait how much
time still? Grouillez you!

334
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,139
How much time I will say it to you?!

335
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,849
They is too dangerous here!

336
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,970
Not only for us,
but for them too!

337
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,860
Where that one goes, it there
always danger has.

338
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,790
Flee, please!

339
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,880
Quickly!

340
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,269
Shit!

341
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,230
Ca is enough, young girl.

342
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,150
You know that if you
try to help these criminals,

343
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,360
you will be accused of complicity.

344
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,990
In any case, to have used several
time an abusive language towards us,

345
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,790
and for obstruction with
a gardien de la paix…

346
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,880
These criminals of class 5 are
condemned to the “drifting cloud”!

347
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,089
But I said to you that
it was an accident!

348
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,139
Go… dispatch us!

349
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,930
STOP them!

350
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,829
Please, flee!

351
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,830
You cannot beat them!

352
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,229
Fire!

353
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,180
MILKY ARROW!

354
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,849
Passes in front of, Nami!

355
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,740
Of agreement!

356
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,769
It is what this trick?

357
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,110
Clouds?

358
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,559
Charge…

359
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,990
White berets!

360
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,060
He? How you made that?

361
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,630
Catch it!

362
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,930
They is too marrowy,
I cannot run!

363
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,640
Caution!

364
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,050
What a insane! To try to escape to us!

365
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,829
Then it is that!

366
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,450
A skate-Dial, hein?

367
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,370
It is the class!

368
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,700
Extra, your weapons, the guy!

369
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,859
What…?

370
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,180
Brothel, which is what it…?

371
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,669
Its arm…

372
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,539
lengthened!

373
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,790
My God!

374
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,820
GOMU GOMU NO…

375
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,700
Impossible…! A fruit of the demon?!

376
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,260
HANABI!!
[Hanabi:Fireworks]

377
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,699
With the fact…

378
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,690
Nami!

379
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,509
Which is the state of our finances?

380
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,269
There remain to us 50.000 berrys.

381
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,189
50.000? It is all?

382
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,490
In theory, that holds us
only one day or two.

383
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,949
It is what this misery?

384
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,439
As a Captain, I warn you.

385
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,619
He will be necessary to stop throwing
money by the windows!

386
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,140
ANY SHARE IN MT PUFFS OUT!

387
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,890
Well!

388
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,440
It would be said that my plan B
functioned with wonder.

389
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,550
Really?!

390
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,899
White Berets…

391
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,140
They beat them…

392
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,090
I believed that people of
Mer Bleue were weakened here.

393
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,669
The insane poor!

394
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,399
Finished cretins!

395
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,590
It is too late, now!

396
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,860
You should have listened to me
well nicely!

397
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,050
The White Berets are the guards more
nice and understanding of the Divine Earth.

398
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,590
But “them”… They
will not be so lenient!

399
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,770
You are now
criminals of Class 2!

400
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,120
You will beg in vain…

401
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,280
Priests of Upper Yard…

402
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,169
… will regulate your fate!

403
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,590
Heso!

1
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:59,900
Cherry trees of Hiluluk!

2
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:59,900
The miracle of the mountains of Drum

3
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,490
I will make flower of the cherry trees here.

4
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,460
If I can conclude my research, this country will be saved!

5
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,290
As a doctor, I will cure this country!

6
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,340
You do not want rather to say to destroy it?

7
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,430
It is a covered with snow island, it makes cold all the year.

8
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,300
Never no cherry tree will be able to flower here.

9
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
They will flower!

10
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,810
I was only one dead loss despaired at the edge of the pit.

11
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,230
However, when I saw these cherry trees, I took again taste with the life.

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,650
I felt completely transformed…

13
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,530
Ca wants to say that any man in this world can be saved!

14
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,530
There is not a disease in the world which doesnot can be neat!

15
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,120
This flag with the tête de mort enabled me to face all the diseases!

16
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,210
Because you see, it is the symbol of a will which defies the impossible one!

17
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,710
By holding up this flag, I will fight like a pirate!

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,050
Chopper, you should take the sea one of these days.

19
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,220
You will realize that your concern is really unimportant!

20
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,430
Doctor…

21
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,350
I…

22
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,640
Found!

23
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,690
He! Wait, wait!

24
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,480
Join us!

25
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
Are you well, Dalton-San?

26
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,910
Yes, that goes.

27
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,120
I lost consciousness a few seconds.

28
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,080
I have right need for a little rest.

29
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,500
He, you others.

30
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,630
D- Doctor Kureha!

31
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,010
Does Ca go, the snotty-nosed kid?

32
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,140
Bring the casualties to the infirmary.

33
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,180
You are this species of old witch of the other time!

34
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,600
And do not forget anybody!

35
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,730
Yes!

36
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,770
There are not the time of trainailler.

37
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,230
Unless you want to undergo the same fate only this type.

38
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,610
Nami-San, you should perhaps remain time here that you would be completely restored.

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,490
Keep silent yourself!

40
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,700
If we do not leave now, it will be necessary to wait two days before being able to put the course on Arabasta!

41
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,740
Do you want to see Vivi suffering even more?

42
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,160
Stop feeling sorry for you…

43
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,360
… and turns over immediately in your room!!!

44
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,340
I am Usopp! The Usopp captain!

45
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,780
As I thought it, it worsened its state.

46
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,950
It is what arrives when one wants to make some too much.

47
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,460
Well, now…

48
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,670
Dalton. Where is the key of the arms manufacture of the castle?

49
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,500
You know it, not true?

50
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,670
The key of arms manufacture? What do you want to make some?

51
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,220
What I want to do, that does not look at you.

52
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,350
Wapol always kept this key on him.

53
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,970
And in this case, it was dispatched in the airs with him.

54
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,940
What? Are you serious?

55
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,140
Ca will pose a problem…

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,690
Doctorine…

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,440
What would you say to look after our crew free?

58
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,990
And so could you let me start from continuation?

59
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,490
I think that you know already the answer.

60
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,000
The price to be paid, it is all the gold and the cargo of your boat.

61
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,330
And you must remain here for at least two days more.

62
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,250
Nami-San, it rightly!
You must let it deal with you!

63
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,970
I am well.
I am not with the article of death.

64
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,380
There is not the question!

65
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,430
You this key to open arms manufacture, isn't this needs?

66
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,600
How you had this key?!

67
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,400
Is this really the key?

68
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,900
What does that want to say?

69
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,860
I stole it.

70
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,400
You have really base to make me blackmail.

71
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,490
You are really only one small chieuse.

72
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,740
Well.

73
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,290
I will not ask for any payment for your care.

74
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,790
But it is all.

75
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,790
As a doctor, I cannot reach your second request.

76
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,290
He, wait a little!

77
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,340
In this case, give again to me the key!

78
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,130
Return the-me!

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Listen a little, salts gamine!

80
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,390
I must go away one moment to regulate some businesses.

81
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,020
And nobody is assembling the guard.

82
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,020
There is a coat in the convenient one at the bottom of the room.

83
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,310
Moreover, I finished operating the vertebral column of this greenhorn, but…

84
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
Listen well!
Do not try to flee!

85
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,700
You, you come with me!
I will need strong arms!

86
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,560
Yes.

87
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,080
In fact, she wants that I put a coat, that one takes Sanji-Kun with us and that one leaves from here.

88
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,880
It is also what I included/understood.

89
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,850
Ca makes a small moment that I run, now…

90
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,640
It makes already night.

91
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,100
I do not hear it any more…

92
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,820
It would be said that it finally gave up.

93
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,320
It is better thus.

94
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,110
It is out of the question which I leave.

95
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,700
It is the full moon, this evening…

96
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,200
He!!!!

97
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,540
THE REINDEER!!!!

98
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,160
Become a pirate with me!

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,500
It is not true! He is always after me!

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,790
He, Luffy… drops.

101
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,670
It will not be shown just because you howl like that.

102
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,050
He does not want to be a pirate.

103
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,720
I want that he unites with us!

104
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,010
And it will join us!

105
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,890
CA It IS WHAT YOU YOU WANT!!!

106
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,890
It is not that I do not want to leave…

107
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,190
THE REINDEER!

108
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,810
GO SHOWS ITSELF!

109
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,810
The reindeer!

110
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,800
But I cannot!

111
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,240
I cannot leave!

112
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,420
I am not like them!

113
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,870
The reindeer!

114
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,590
Tony-Kun.

115
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,220
He! Become a pirate with me!

116
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,710
Hein?!

117
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,010
I cannot.

118
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,800
Go, you will see! It is brilliant!

119
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,350
You did not even hear his explanations yet!

120
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,040
I want to say…

121
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,800
I want to say that I am a reindeer!

122
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,040
With wood, shoes, and…

123
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,320
And a blue nose!

124
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,620
You think of being able to cure his ravaged heart?

125
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,460
I want to become a pirate, but…

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,260
I cannot be the friend of human, here all!

127
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,590
I am a monster!

128
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,760
Somebody as me cannot be your companion!

129
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,760
Then…!

130
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,680
Then, I came…

131
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,190
I came to say thank you.

132
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,360
Thank you for your proposal.

133
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,070
I will remain here, but…

134
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,540
If the heart of said to you, return to see me one of these days and…

135
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,790
Close it!!!

136
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,460
ALLONS-Y!!!

137
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,640
“It Closes ". It is like that you hope to make it come?

138
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,210
Nami.

139
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,920
You are sour of better being?

140
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,880
I am well, I breathe health!

141
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,160
Yosh, now I will finish my bonhomme de neige.

142
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,260
He, shouldn't we say goodbye to this old nipple like with this same of doctor?

143
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,180
That you are stupid.

144
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,600
Let do it its good-byes with all alone Doctorine.

145
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,560
Stop! Drop that, rather will prepare the télécâble!

146
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,060
Ca makes now six years that they live side by side.

147
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,560
There surely will be many sadness and tears.

148
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,860
Doctorine can appear hard with the first access…

149
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,280
… but it has really an enormous heart.

150
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,030
Really?

151
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,700
Then, one will leave like that?

152
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Exactly.

153
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,120
As soon as Chopper returns, the mountain will be descended…

154
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,250
… and one will put the course on Arabasta!

155
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,370
Vivi isn't, that is appropriate to you?

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,630
Yes, since we have a doctor.

157
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,210
A doctor?

158
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,380
Very well. Then I will prepare the télécâble.

159
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,880
He, Luffy! Come to give me a knack!

160
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,260
I did not even know that there was a télécâble!

161
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,810
It is brilliant!

162
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,940
After the left assets all,

163
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,070
put them on line, directed towards the sky.

164
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,700
Dr. Kureha!

165
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,780
Why are we emptying the arms manufacture of all its guns?

166
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,910
Instead of nothing to make, put yourself at the job.

167
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,010
Eh well, one would say that it misses some patients here.

168
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,850
They left.

169
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,930
Without listening to your orders.

170
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,060
I see…

171
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,270
Which band the irresponsible ones.

172
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,780
Doctorine!

173
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,820
Doctorine!

174
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,500
I must speak to you!

175
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,080
Was Chopper, but where you?

176
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,040
Goes in bottom, to help to install the guns.

177
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,710
Listen to me, Doctorine!

178
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,510
I will become pirate!

179
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,050
I leave with them!

180
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,800
What do you say?

181
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,340
I take the sea!

182
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,720
I will be their companion as a ship's doctor!

183
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,430
I will make the round the world tour!

184
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,310
WOULD NOT BE STUPID!

185
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,020
Listen to me well, you are my only and single assisting!

186
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,020
Say a little to me… who taught you medicine?

187
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,490
Or don't you thus have any regard for me?

188
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,820
C it is not true…

189
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,990
Doctorine. I am attached to this place.

190
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,290
Because it is here that I met you as well as the Doctor.

191
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,330
Then remains.

192
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,250
Where can you live elsewhere than in this large castle?

193
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,300
Piracy is not made for you!

194
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,090
I do not give your skin expensive!

195
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,550
Little imports me!

196
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,560
Stop speaking like an idiot!

197
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,520
Who already saw a reindeer taking the sea?!

198
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,060
It IS TRUE, I AM a REINDEER!!!

199
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,730
BUT, I AM ALSO A MAN!!!

200
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,740
Since it is thus!

201
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,990
I will never give myself the permission to leave!

202
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,990
If you want to leave, it will be necessary that you me master keys on the body!

203
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,330
Doctorine?

204
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,290
How a chiard as you can be claimed a man?

205
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,800
What a joke!

206
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,760
But Doctorine, it…

207
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,350
Close it!
ALLONS-Y!!!

208
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,810
… included/understood…

209
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,020
CLOSE it!

210
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,020
I will not admit your selfishness!

211
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,360
YOU WILL NOT GO Nowhere, CHOPPER!

212
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,080
RETURN HERE!

213
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,080
He, one would say that it occurs something.

214
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,120
Do not pay attention.

215
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,290
If one did not finish leaving all the guns outside,

216
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,420
Dr. Kureha will start to be irritated and to balance us above tricks.

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,970
Yes, you are right.

218
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,220
Return!

219
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,680
You will not leave!

220
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,100
CHOPPER!!!

221
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,520
HEAT IN FRONT!!!

222
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,560
What? It would be said that something occurs in the castle.

223
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,900
Really, which lack of respect.

224
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,150
Can't they thus make less noise in this night when two people bid their farewell?

225
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,450
I am afflicted, Doctorine!

226
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,820
But I want to discover the world!

227
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,250
I wonder what somebody as suits you to go to make on the seas!?

228
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,420
You believe that you just like will live in a dream this charlatan of doctor?!

229
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,220
You are mistaken! It was not a dream!

230
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,850
RESEARCH OF THE DOCTOR SUCCEEDED!!

231
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,890
Is He, it him?

232
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,520
What occurs?

233
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,980
She pursues it!

234
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,060
He! The télécâble is ready with…

235
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,650
HOW EVERYONE GOES UP IN THE SLEDGE!

236
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,530
ONE WILL GO DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN!

237
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,030
WHAT?!

238
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,580
He, look at!

239
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,210
But what is it that?

240
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,920
The sledge of the witch…

241
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,520
What was it?

242
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,690
It was the reindeer of Dr. Kureha!

243
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,900
The pirates were in the sledge!

244
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,610
But what did it occur up there?

245
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,980
And Wapol?

246
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,900
Is Dalton-San well?

247
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,280
It was brilliant, this descent!

248
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,870
He, let us remake one!

249
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,790
Imbecile! One from goes away!

250
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,710
I believed well that I was going to die!

251
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,790
Where I am?!

252
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,040
Are Sanji-San, you awaked?

253
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,510
Summers you sure that will go, after you to be left kind?

254
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,480
One of my pets left, here all.

255
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,690
I hate the good-byes.

256
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,360
Go!

257
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,280
One will make them a colourful good-bye!

258
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,330
IEA…

259
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,330
I finally succeeded!

260
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,380
It is the reaction which I had waited for 30 years!

261
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,130
Doctor, it was not that a dream, isn't?

262
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,930
Your research succeeded, not true?!

263
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,930
Or was this still only one lie?

264
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,640
I succeeded, Chopper!

265
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,890
My research succeeded!

266
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,020
You have says that before dying…

267
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,810
… because you do not want that I would be sad?

268
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,860
“Nothing is impossible for a man who lives under the banner with the tête de mort!”

269
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Repetitions it once again, Doctor!

270
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,820
DOES ANY EAST AVOID, THE SNOTTY-NOSED KID!?

271
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,950
YES!

272
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,200
FIRE!!

273
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,660
Listen to Kureha, this powder…

274
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,750
Dr. Kureha, what you…?

275
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,260
Close and looks at it!

276
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,300
Ca comes from the castle!

277
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,010
Does Wapol make a fireworks?

278
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,470
Imbecile! It is the artillery!

279
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,980
What occurs?

280
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,190
Made attention with the boulets de canon!

281
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,600
Shit, it shows too dark them!

282
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,900
Dr. Kureha! All the shells were sent!

283
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,990
Light!

284
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,370
Incredible…

285
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:27,990
Yes.

286
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,710
Splendid!

287
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,880
It is the fruit of my 30 years of research!

288
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,590
They is… so marvellous…

289
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,850
You cannot include/understand what it occurs in the head from insane.

290
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,890
I will make flower of the cherry trees here!

291
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,860
If I can conclude my research, this country will be saved!

292
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,280
BREAK FROM HERE, CHARLATAN!

293
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,280
Shit! I was persuaded that with an eye of triton it would go!

294
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,450
Listen! This red powder is not ordinary.

295
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,750
It will be fixed at snow in the atmosphere…

296
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,670
And snow pink will make shine!

297
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,380
Doctor…!

298
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,220
Doctorine…!

299
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,300
I do not want to make you of evil!!

300
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,510
My name is Dr. Hiluluk!

301
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,760
I am a doctor!

302
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,430
Tony Tony Chopper!

303
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,600
It is well like first name, not true?

304
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,520
Thus I will call you.

305
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,270
Chopper, you will make a good doctor.

306
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,770
I promise it to you!

307
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,410
Even after my death, my dream will become reality.

308
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,240
It was really a formidable life!

309
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,580
Thank you in you, Chopper.

310
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,600
Goes, now!

311
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,140
My wire idiot!

00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:54,843
<i>(The following episode is based
on Manga ch.7: "Romance Dawn,</i>

2
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:57,244
The Dawn Of Adventure" and Ch.8: "Nami")

3
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:02,700
What a great harvest today.

4
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:06,537
We robbed so many treasures,
Mr. Buggy won't scold us.

5
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,899
Hey, look.

6
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:15,219
What's wrong with that ship?

7
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,223
Oh, there is a woman.

8
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:32,668
Hey, what's wrong with you?

9
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:38,569
Ah.. am I dreaming?

10
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,452
I never thought that I could
meet anyone over the sea.

11
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:44,675
Though I don't know who you
are, please give me some water.

12
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,634
Would you please give me some water?

13
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,781
I can give you all my money if you want.

14
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,367
Please help me.

15
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:54,619
Ok, we can help you.

16
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,688
But we have to make sure
what is inside your box.

17
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,037
Sorry.

18
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:04,663
I can't open it.

19
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,334
Really?

20
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,905
If you like, I can give them all to you.

21
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,473
And that ship.

22
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:17,475
Ah, our ship.

23
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:20,208
Thief! You lied to us!

24
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:25,883
There are some black clouds over the
southern sky, and some cold front.

25
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,920
I predict the storm is coming soon.

26
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:31,548
Careful, the little ship
is easy to turn over!

27
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,990
Bingo!

28
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:46,942
Goodbye!

29
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:49,457
I'll take your treasures!

30
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,276
Don't run away, you thief!

31
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,645
We will remember you!

32
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:57,899
"Luffy's Past!
Meet Red-Haired Shanks"

33
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,010
"Luffy no Kako!
Akagami no Shanks Toujou"

34
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,080
I am so hungry.

35
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,895
How soon will we be on land?

36
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,263
I don't know.

37
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:15,333
Just follow the wind.

38
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:18,102
Are we there? No, but we will be.

39
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,380
Someday.

40
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,305
You want to be a pirate king, but you don't
know any sailing skills. Isn't it strange?

41
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:29,080
Why? I am always following the wind.

42
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,184
So you also earn money
by roaming over the sea.

43
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:37,419
I don't remember having told you I
earned my living by earning prizes.

44
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:42,160
I am on the sea for a man.

45
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,096
Then I got lost.

46
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:48,933
So I have to earn some money
by catching those pirates.

47
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,535
So you are lost.

48
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,493
Shut up! YOU are lost!

49
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,895
Shanks.

50
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:11,579
It has been with me through many
battles. It's very important to me.

51
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,935
Luffy, I will never give
it away, even to you.

52
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,996
Bring me with you next time, Shanks.

53
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:53,784
I want to be a pirate, too.

54
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:58,302
How could it be possible?

55
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,412
Why not?

56
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,609
Luffy, even if you are a good swimmer,

57
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,244
you can't be a pirate.

58
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:07,812
I can fight well.

59
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:10,181
My fists are also very good.

60
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:11,182
Really?

61
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,950
What do you mean?

62
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,820
Anyway, you are too young.

63
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:18,189
Yes, you are about the
same age as my children.

64
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,658
I am not a child! I am a grown man!

65
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,260
Ok, don't be angry.

66
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,028
Come on, drink some juice.

67
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,532
Ah, thank you.

68
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,567
Kids are kids, easy to cheer!

69
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:30,878
You are wicked, Shanks!

70
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,038
Don't laugh!

71
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,787
Stingy Shanks!

72
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,478
Excuse me.

73
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:59,467
Those people are all pirates,
they all look so funny.

74
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:05,556
Welcome.

75
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:10,308
We are mountain men.

76
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,377
Don't be afraid, we are not here to rub.

77
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:16,194
We want to buy ten bottles of wine.

78
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,811
Sorry, we are sold out.

79
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,620
Why, it is strange.

80
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:26,390
Those pirates are drinking; do
you mean they are drinking urine?

81
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,383
Sorry, but we don't have any wine.

82
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:32,063
I am really very sorry.

83
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:34,145
Look like we drank too much.

84
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,798
Sorry.

85
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,402
If you don't mind, take this one.

86
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:39,848
It's not opened.

87
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:55,154
I am worth 8 million belly's. One bottle
is not enough. Don't look down on me.

88
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,370
Ah, the floor is wet.

89
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,028
I am sorry, Makino.

90
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:05,196
Let me clean it.

91
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:06,960
Ah, I can clean it.

92
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:15,906
Looks like you enjoy sweeping.

93
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,164
Enjoy yourself well.

94
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:23,149
It is meaningless if
there is no wine. Let's go.

95
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,634
Goodbye, cowards.

96
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,645
Are you ok, captain? Did you get hurt?

97
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,731
Ah, it's ok. I am fine.

98
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,608
Our captain is so poor.

99
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:51,981
It is ridiculous.

100
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,814
How can you laugh?

101
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:58,783
Don't you feel ashamed?

102
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,985
Why didn't you fight?

103
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:03,754
Even though they are so many!

104
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,290
You are not men to
laugh at such a thing!

105
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,257
And you are not pirates either!

106
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,264
I can understand how you feel.

107
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,432
But it is just some wine.

108
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,367
You don't need to be that angry.

109
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:17,195
I don't want to talk to you!

110
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:26,656
Are you stuffing yourself, Luffy?.

111
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,009
Leave me alone!

112
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,412
What are you eating?

113
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:35,119
Is that the box?

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,920
Did you eat the things
in the box? > Yes.

115
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,524
Spit up, spit them all out!

116
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,058
What's wrong, Shanks?

117
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,340
What is that?

118
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,951
You ate the "rubber fruit"!

119
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:01,145
Rubber fruit is called "Devil Fruit."

120
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,013
After you ate it, your
body would become rubber!

121
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:05,966
You won't be able to
swim after eating it!

122
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:08,794
No!

123
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:11,298
You little bastard!

124
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,505
I was drinking happily.

125
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,112
Are you tired of living, kid?

126
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,663
You dog, apologize now. How
can you look down on Shanks?

127
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:43,554
What did I say to make you so unhappy?

128
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,869
You just said it! Apologize now!

129
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,336
Mayor!

130
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,698
<i>Did you see those pirates' faces?</i>

131
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:57,835
<i>You didn't even say a word.</i>

132
00:10:57,836 --> 00:10:59,121
<i>You are such a coward.</i>

133
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:02,952
<i>Pirates are all cowards.
All they can do is play cool.</i>

134
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,365
Stop it!

135
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:06,577
<i>Ah?</i>

136
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,479
<i>Don't look down on
Shanks and his friends!</i>

137
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,114
<i>They are not cowards!</i>

138
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,203
<i>Stop, Luffy!</i>

139
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,457
You can't look down on Shanks!
You bunch of stupid mountain men!

140
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,261
You are too impolite, kid.

141
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:27,999
So far no one can live
if they irritate me.

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,734
Wait a minute.

143
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:32,646
Let go of that kid, please.

144
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:37,775
I don't know what Luffy did,

145
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,610
and I don't want to fight with you.

146
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,046
If I have ever offended
you, I would like to pay you.

147
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:44,087
Please, give that kid a chance.

148
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:45,824
Mayor.

149
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,721
Indeed elders are more
polite and knows the norms.

150
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:53,190
But it is useless this kid is finished.

151
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,714
Because he made me really angry.

152
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,966
It is your fault, monkey!

153
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,467
You are in big trouble.

154
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll let you say you're sorry in hell.

155
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:08,029
Luffy! >Please, give him a break.

156
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:11,703
I wonder why the bar is empty?

157
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,446
Aren't they those pirates?

158
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,671
Captain!

159
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,689
Shanks.

160
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:46,810
Pirates, why are you still here?

161
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,480
Are you still sweeping?

162
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:53,751
Luffy, I thought your fists
are more powerful than guns.

163
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,212
Shut up!

164
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,690
I don't know why you are here,
but get out before you get hurt.

165
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:04,191
If you come any closer, you
better watch your head, coward.

166
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,865
I told you not to come any closer.

167
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,547
Or I'll smash your head.

168
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,857
You are risking your life.

169
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:23,147
You're going to pay
for this with your life.

170
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:25,382
What you are talking about?

171
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:28,388
I mean, you cannot scare me.

172
00:13:40,273 --> 00:13:41,772
What?

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,468
They started it!

174
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,136
Really nasty!

175
00:13:46,137 --> 00:13:47,204
Nasty?

176
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:48,806
It is so naive.

177
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:51,709
You think this is a game?

178
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,411
Those in front of you are pirates.

179
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:57,614
Shut up! It is none of your business!

180
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,183
Listen, mountain man...

181
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:03,687
Even if you throw wine or food
on my head, or you spit at me,

182
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:06,290
I will laugh it over
as if nothing happened.

183
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,393
No matter what your reason is,

184
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:12,420
I won't spare those guys
who ever hurt my friends.

185
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,070
Shanks!

186
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:17,601
You won't spare us?

187
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:20,971
Ridiculous pirates! Kill them all!

188
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,240
Charge!

189
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,399
Let me handle it one is enough.

190
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,888
Don't be arrogant, mountain man!

191
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,812
If you want to fight us,
send over a battleship.

192
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:44,666
Sweet.

193
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:49,566
Wait, this kid irritated us first!

194
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,295
I heard your head's
worth a lot of money.

195
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:53,378
Damn you!

196
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:55,534
Smoke bomb!

197
00:14:59,077 --> 00:14:59,982
Luffy!

198
00:15:01,146 --> 00:15:04,114
Oh no, I let him go! Luffy is kidnapped!

199
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,716
What can we do now?

200
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:08,185
Calm down! Stupid head.

201
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,268
Let's look for him together
we will find him soon.

202
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:13,532
I can't stand this guy.

203
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,795
I can get away easily.

204
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:20,798
They would never imagine a
mountain man would go out to sea!

205
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,534
Let go of me, you stupid monkey!

206
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:25,197
Go to hell!

207
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:28,906
Stupid kid, YOU go to hell!

208
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,775
You irritated me first.

209
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:32,616
Bye bye.

210
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,146
Damn him!

211
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:39,016
Those guys are garbage.
I can't even beat them.

212
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,021
Damn him!

213
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:49,057
Sorry, it is pity that
you are useless now.

214
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:00,000
What? What the hell is that?

215
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:09,974
Help, help!

216
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,153
Shanks.

217
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,373
Get out.

218
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,238
I want to thank you, Luffy.

219
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:59,635
Makino told me.

220
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,333
You challenged them because of us.

221
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,819
Don't cry, you are a man.

222
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,570
Shanks...

223
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,040
Your arm!

224
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,291
Sorry, but it is just an arm.

225
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,915
I am glad that you are safe.

226
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:43,607
Are you leaving now?

227
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,744
Yes, we have stayed here too
long. It is time to say goodbye.

228
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:49,246
Will you get lonely?

229
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:51,782
Yes, I will be very lonely.

230
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:53,984
But I won't ask you to take me.

231
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:57,321
Because I decided to
be a pirate by myself.

232
00:17:57,322 --> 00:18:01,158
I won't take you with me anyway.

233
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,661
You thought you can be a pirate?

234
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:05,507
I can!

235
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:09,666
Someday I will find my
partners as good as yours.

236
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,202
And to find the best
treasure in the world.

237
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:16,130
I will definitely become a pirate king!

238
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,838
You want to surpass us?

239
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:23,086
Here.

240
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,585
I leave this hat to you.

241
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:33,616
This is the most important
thing to me. Keep it well.

242
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,869
<i>Someday, I will come to
you and get it back...</i>

243
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,711
when you become a good pirate.

244
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:03,387
A deal is a deal, Luffy.

245
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:18,201
Hey, you are daydreaming again.
That hat is important, isn't it?

246
00:19:18,202 --> 00:19:18,978
Yes.

247
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,634
Thanks, Zoro.

248
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:25,742
Ah, I am so hungry.

249
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,686
There's a bird.

250
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:37,754
Let's eat the bird.

251
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:39,456
How?

252
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:40,497
Watch this

253
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:42,849
GOMU GOMU NO!...

254
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,557
ROCKET!

255
00:19:46,464 --> 00:19:47,624
What a genius.

256
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:58,075
Help!

257
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,299
Idiot, what are you doing?

258
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:10,387
Hey, stop now! The ship
over there, please stop!

259
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:12,622
Somebody is in danger at the wrong time.

260
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:14,764
I am busy! Save yourself!

261
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,354
What did you say?

262
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:22,089
You are quite skilled.

263
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,016
Do you want us die?

264
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:25,902
Stop the ship.

265
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:29,840
We are underlings of "Buggy the Clown"!

266
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,137
We want this ship.

267
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:39,850
I didn't know you are the famous
"pirate hunter," Master Zoro.

268
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:41,946
We are very sorry.

269
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:45,155
You made me lose my partners.

270
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,656
Sail forward in full swing.

271
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:48,024
Yes.

272
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:51,875
By Luffy's capacity, it should
be no problem to be on land.

273
00:20:54,699 --> 00:20:58,702
To take it seriously,
buddy, what should we do now?

274
00:20:58,703 --> 00:20:59,769
You are right.

275
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,073
Our treasure and ship
are stolen by that girl.

276
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,908
If captain Buggy knows this...

277
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:08,545
What is this "Buggy" that
you are talking about?

278
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,981
Haven't you heard of "Buggy the Clown"?

279
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:12,073
Never.

280
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,652
He is the leader of our pirate ship.

281
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:19,322
And he is one of the people
who ate the "Devil Fruit".

282
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:22,886
He is very terrible, to put it simply.

283
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:41,885
Great! I finally got it!

284
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:45,649
Wait, stinky girl!

285
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,384
Thief! Give us back our map!

286
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:50,540
We've just grabbed it! It's
the map of the "Grand Line"!

287
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:54,724
Damn! If we can't get it
back, we must die miserably.

288
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,737
I don't want to die
under the captain's bombs.

289
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:03,166
Captain Buggy.

290
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,686
Some unknown object is
above the sky of the harbor.

291
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:07,290
Shoot it down!

292
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:14,852
What?

293
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:26,524
What?

294
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,182
What?

295
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:30,259
Somebody fell down.

296
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:34,258
Where did the bomb come from?

297
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:41,972
Thank God I'm alive.

298
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:44,117
What a strange journey this is!

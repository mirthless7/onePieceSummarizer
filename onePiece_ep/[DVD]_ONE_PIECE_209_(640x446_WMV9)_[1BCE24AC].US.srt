1
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:58,425
FIRST ROUND!
THE DONUT RACE

2
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,407
Brothel.

3
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:06,408
This time you ace really talked cock Luffy.

4
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,808
All that one has to do is to gain.

5
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,074
Hey! You forgot that.

6
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:15,075
There register above the various participants
and transmit to it to the manager play.

7
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,607
But to the second turn,

8
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:20,408
The participants registered above could not be modified.

9
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,608
With what will have we right?

10
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:25,474
There are race, sport and combat.

11
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:26,474
Look at that…

12
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:29,074
There is no limit of participants for the race.

13
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,475
953…

14
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,141
And the organization counts 500 members.

15
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,274
Eh well!

16
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,675
One all will take part in it.

17
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:40,274
But according to the rules it is prohibited that one
even nobody takes part in the three tests.

18
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:43,275
Will Hey, what it occur if one loses?

19
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,474
I am sure that they want the Ussop Captain.

20
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:48,540
Not, they will want me me…

21
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,875
Prettiest.

22
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:54,207
Listen to all, one has just received
the list of the participants of the two teams!

23
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,940
I will announce them!

24
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:58,674
First of all, Mugiwara TEAM!

25
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:01,074
For the first test, Donut Race!

26
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:04,675
All pirates of the crew
straw hat decided to take part in it!

27
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:07,274
Afflicted, jai caught again the disease of
“I cannot take part in this race”.

28
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:08,974
I do not want the knowledge!

29
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,541
You buckle it and you cheeks!

30
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:13,074
For the second test, Groggy Boxing ring!

31
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:17,808
The participants are,
Roronoa Zoro, Sanji and Tony Tony Chopper!

32
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,140
Do not make the ball this time!

33
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,407
Similar for you!

34
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,407
I would make…

35
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:23,474
of…

36
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:24,475
my better!

37
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:28,074
For the third test, Run Around With rollers!

38
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:33,475
The participants are,
Monkey D. Luffy, Nico Robin, Nami and Ussop!

39
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,075
One needs 5 people.

40
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,874
We miss somebody.

41
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,008
Do not make any you, one will gain!

42
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:46,008
A captain, a epeist, a navigatrice, a gunner
of elite, a cook, a doctor and an archeologist.

43
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:50,208
Let us see seeing which I want?

44
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,675
It will be perhaps that one.

45
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,275
It is him whom I want!

46
00:03:55,808 --> 00:04:00,608
Do not forget, to gain and it is
the festival, lose and you are finished.

47
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:03,141
Here pitiless Davy Back Fight!

48
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:09,275
I present myself, I am the master of ceremony of
Foxy Pirates which will comment on this competition!

49
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:13,408
The first round will begin, Donut Race!

50
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,875
One makes how much teams?

51
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:21,008
If one takes into account the fact that they
can have fruits of the demon…

52
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:23,741
best would be 3 or 4 teams.

53
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,674
In order to build your boat, one will provide you…

54
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,208
2 oars and 3 barrels.

55
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:32,608
If you use other materials,
you risk the disqualification!

56
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,808
Maintaining all depends on your
skill to build a boat.

57
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,140
Come to recover the barrels for
the construction of your boat.

58
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:41,275
You do not worry, all is free!

59
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,541
With only 3 barrels…

60
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:46,808
It is almost impossible of
to build a boat for 3 people.

61
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,741
Good, it would be time to choose the 3 foremen.

62
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,208
IMBECILE!

63
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,340
Why you peeled it without reflecting?!

64
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,741
Look at well, I will build an exceptional boat.

65
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:09,541
While you build your boat,
I will explain you the rules of Donut Race.

66
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,607
The race consists in making the turn
island “Length Boxing ring Long Land”!

67
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,808
Memorize well the layout which is likely to be enough coriace!

68
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,008
If your boat runs, you are disqualified!

69
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:26,408
Guns, guns, swords, all is allowed!

70
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:30,541
If you find these rules unjust, then
you do not deserve to be pirates!

71
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:33,875
I finally finished.

72
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:37,874
There is no limit of time!

73
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,875
Are the preparations finished?

74
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,741
I have just received the list!

75
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:46,674
Do I have to announce most popular initially?

76
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,875
First of all let us start with the favorite!

77
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:54,775
Representing Foxy TEAM,
our idol with all Porch-chan!

78
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,808
Afflicted to have made you wait.

79
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:04,275
It will be assisted of Kabouti man- thefish and of Cleaned the spangled shark, their boat is “Cutie Wagon”!

80
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:08,608
It will be easy for you, one counts on you!

81
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:11,475
Wait! It is a fish that!

82
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:14,341
No rule prohibits to make use of a fish.

83
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,608
The second favorite…

84
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,875
“Arara Egaiaiai”

85
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:24,475
The crew of the straw hat is made up of Nami the navigatrice, Ussop the tireur d'élite and Robin the archeologist!

86
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,541
Their boat is “Barrel Wagon”!

87
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:30,674
This russet-red is too sexy!

88
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,475
I want the brown one in the crew!

89
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,607
One does not want of the guy.

90
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:35,541
At all.

91
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:37,274
I see…

92
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:42,075
Foxy pirates are very attached to
the presence of sexy women in the crew.

93
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:44,674
One will not run?

94
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:45,675
I already said it…

95
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,808
I am not a carpenter!

96
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,008
Incredible, they dared to build that.

97
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,341
It is not a boat this machine, it is right a tub.

98
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,141
Ca is equal for me.

99
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,207
You will continue like that to the finishing line?

100
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,874
Ouais, I will continue to pedal until the arrival.

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,541
it is a miracle which they manage to float.

102
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,541
If nothing is done…

103
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,041
one is likely to lose this race.

104
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:12,607
The third is the “Harem No Tango”.

105
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:16,408
It is a boat only made up of creatures of dream.

106
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:20,808
The fourth is “Honey Krenge”,
they have the super air justified!

107
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:24,941
The fifth is “Ichigo Nigo”

108
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:28,275
The sixth is the boat of festival is the “Oyakata”.

109
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,608
Seventh is…

110
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,808
The boat “Special Duku”.

111
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:35,608
Objection! And our boat then?

112
00:07:35,608 --> 00:07:37,408
Ouais, ours too!

113
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:43,941
Chopper and the epeist Zoro, “Torro Mana Go”.

114
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,808
It is with the thirteenth position!

115
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,408
Eh well, if it is the case.

116
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:56,875
The next one on the list is the “Droove”!

117
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,875
Does Ca want to say what “Droove”?

118
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:01,875
Ca wants to say second on the basis of the end.

119
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,275
Is their boat as null to shit as that?

120
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,208
Coming from the East…

121
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:12,408
The giant boat “Mother Ship”!

122
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,007
Euh… It is not…

123
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,275
… contrary with the rules?

124
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:24,008
How does it make to advance?

125
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,475
Excellent question.

126
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,540
This boat does not move.

127
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,875
But at least, the interior is reinforced!

128
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,541
They is idiots.

129
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,008
Is Euh… why so proud by saying that?

130
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:40,675
This boat is a giant tank.

131
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,808
It is of nothing contrary with the rules.

132
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,675
Maintaining all the boats are joined together
around the starting line.

133
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:56,741
I will comment on top of
my super sparrow of South Blue, Gigin!

134
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:01,808
Hey! Porch-chan!

135
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,674
Run these goods with nothing!

136
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:04,941
Us?!

137
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,275
It is necessary that we beat them as of the beginning!

138
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:09,341
And we have the right to run our competitors.

139
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,140
Oh not, listen to a little what they say.

140
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:17,575
They are free to say what they want Porch-chan, in 5 minutes they will be at the ocean floor, not true Monda?

141
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,474
I am very excited.

142
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,274
You really think that one will succeed in finishing the race?

143
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,740
Hey! Ussop!

144
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:26,941
If something arrives at the two ladies, I burst you.

145
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:29,808
One will gain it is sure and certain!

146
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,008
Cretins.

147
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:37,475
We never lost with the orthodoxe rules.

148
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:41,075
You believe that they will hold how much
time in the race, Hamburger?

149
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:43,075
Not a long time.

150
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:48,741
Now recover the eternal
installations, not to lose you.

151
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,208
To lose itself?

152
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:56,075
Made attention not too move away you from the island.

153
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:01,741
To move away from the island? Why that would be done?

154
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:04,340
One will follow the coast.

155
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,407
Ca is not likely to be also simple.

156
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,475
Why?

157
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,874
Look at well behind us, it there with enormous
boat of the other imbeciles.

158
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,608
One should deviate from the coast from the beginning.

159
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:16,408
It does without something ladle

160
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,075
Is Eh well everyone ready?

161
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,541
READY!

162
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,208
With what you do refer?

163
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,207
Do not make any you, hey the guy!

164
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,741
Upon the departure you of the coast draw aside!

165
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:32,941
Hein? He said something?

166
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,608
Why?

167
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,008
Finally…

168
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,008
DONUT RACE!

169
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,340
Is necessary that one hurries!

170
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,341
But why?

171
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:48,608
Push, push, push.

172
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,075
The true intention of this boat…

173
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,341
… is to put full the mouth of it to you.

174
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,940
It is what that?

175
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,940
It is surely a trap

176
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:07,075
How that? A trap?

177
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:09,475
Nami! Do not do that!

178
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:22,875
We are entitled finally to the technique
special of “Mother Ship”!

179
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:32,675
Afflicted, one will have to take the first
place, do not run immediately.

180
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,741
It is necessary that one moves away from there.

181
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,342
You ace reason, I will get rid of all that!

182
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,341
Calm yourself, Luffy…

183
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:48,007
It is true that, stops! You risks of
to create a gigantic explosion.

184
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,274
But is necessary that one left from there…

185
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,875
One has right need to move away them
of our way, not true?

186
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,942
Luffy, passes to me this oar.

187
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:59,208
What do you intend to make, Zoro?

188
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:01,142
Remain in withdrawal and looks at.

189
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:16,008
They return towards us!

190
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:32,341
Nami-san, Robin-chan, you move away!

191
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,075
The wave comes right on you!

192
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,007
ONE GOES SE WALNUT TREE!!

193
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:43,008
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

194
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:52,275
MUGIWARA-TEAM

195
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:56,825
It is brilliant!

196
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,958
Good blood, with this pace the boat risks
to finish in spare parts.

197
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,225
One will run.

198
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:09,025
It is what this brothel?!

199
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:19,625
Pirates of the straw hat
decided to counter-attack!

200
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,091
It is not possible!

201
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,991
Oh not, if they continue like that,
one will not be able any more to catch up with them.

202
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:27,292
Go Monda, one will owe them
to show our true level.

203
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,558
I count on you all.

204
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:41,292
Ca was finally calmed.

205
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:46,691
During the attack of vagueness, one
an end of the boat lost.

206
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,691
It was really brilliant.

207
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,958
One again can surfer on this wave?

208
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:54,292
Species of imbecile! If one starts again
this time one really will run!

209
00:13:54,558 --> 00:13:56,425
With is the fact, where Nami-san?

210
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,492
Welcome!

211
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,558
Welcome!

212
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,092
It is what?

213
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,225
Hey the guy on the boat come, come by here.

214
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:15,625
And here! sushi inari and udon kitsune free!

215
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,825
Really?! Thank you!!

216
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:24,092
I would like much to have a cook as sexy as you.

217
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,558
He is too nice with his rolled up eyebrows.

218
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,225
Perhaps that I should make me “Davy Backer”…

219
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:34,624
Do the casualty, you have to surely appreciate the festivals?

220
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,757
What a wounded?!

221
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,692
Well, you are in full form so that I see.

222
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:40,824
What would you say of an apple of love?

223
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:41,891
It is what?

224
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:42,958
They is good?

225
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,291
Hey, one needs more than beer here!

226
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,224
Wood as much as you want, does not hesitate!

227
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,692
Thank you the guy.

228
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:56,225
And here is the boat of the festivals, “Oyaku Harlem”

229
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,892
The crew of the straw hat is K.O.

230
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:02,824
They is too good!

231
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:05,224
You hold super good alcohol!

232
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:07,158
Your rolled up eyebrows are too cool.

233
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:10,292
HEY!! Turn over to the race!

234
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:13,858
I wonder whether it is very malignant of your share
to occupy you of the others for the moment.

235
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:17,224
You should first of all worry you about you.

236
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:20,425
Kabouti, shows them your watery karate.

237
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:29,825
An end of the boat was lost!

238
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:32,892
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

239
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,225
Luffy!

240
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:36,292
Nami-san has problem, one goes there!

241
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:37,691
Chopper, allons-y!

242
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:38,358
Hein?

243
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:39,091
Nami-san! Robin-chan!

244
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:41,958
Drop this fat bag, join us!

245
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:45,692
Go, the type with the rolled up eyebrows, return among us!

246
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:48,825
I will undertake some.

247
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,558
Take that.

248
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:58,957
It is what?!

249
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,158
Kabouti!

250
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,625
Excel! Let us profit!

251
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,425
Ussop is thrown to water and retain their boat.

252
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,625
DO NOT SAY ANYTHING!!!

253
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,425
Kabouti, Cleaned! You seize again!

254
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:20,092
We at the head have race adorable “Cutie Wagon”.

255
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,157
Follow-up of near by Barrel Tiger.

256
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,691
And behind them one finds…

257
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,358
A ghost, the “Kamikrengo”!

258
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,158
Well, does one have to implement our plan, Hamburger?

259
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,625
Why not. One starts the festivities, Oyabi?

260
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:42,025
Nami-san, Robin-chan, I come to your rescue!

261
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:49,092
I have just had a brilliant idea, Sanji, gives me that.

262
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,225
it is fast!

263
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,292
You see!

264
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,025
Wait! Nami-san, Robin-chan!

265
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,492
One could not go more quickly?

266
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:06,892
Usually you run more quickly than that?

267
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:07,824
Euh…

268
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:08,558
Oh…

269
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:11,225
I did not think that would be also hard.

270
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:20,492
What?

271
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,424
No the committee of reception?

272
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:30,492
Afflicted.

273
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,691
It is not in our manners.

274
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,292
Ah? Then I will show you ours.

275
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:44,892
Zoro!

276
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,958
One nevertheless will transform you into dust.

277
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:52,358
Chopper, change!

278
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,692
“Torro Mana Go” and “Ichigo Nigo”…

279
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,758
… are disqualified.

280
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,575
Chopper!

281
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,442
They were disqualified?

282
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,575
We either one did not leave the inn.

283
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,107
But tell me Ussop!

284
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:15,574
You have only to use Daiiryu.

285
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:18,775
Of course! if one uses the daiiryu like that…

286
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,775
They are increasingly faster than us!

287
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:27,175
Fleet surely infiltrated
inside when one was in Navarone!

288
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:29,041
You do not have a Jet Daiiryu?

289
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,107
I do not touch with this kind of thing!

290
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,975
And the Daiiryu Impact?

291
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:36,242
I left it on the Merry Vogue…

292
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,908
What there is?! You do not believe me?!

293
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:42,708
Why I would lie me?!

294
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,907
The life of one of my friends is concerned!

295
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,042
I did not say anything.

296
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:48,575
But, the true problem…

297
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:51,242
is that if this race is lost…

298
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:54,642
they will take to me in first…

299
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:58,842
because of my beauty. One must avoid that at all costs!

300
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,208
You have ideas, go oar.

301
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,541
Robin, what you make, you read a book?!

302
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:08,475
I row.

303
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:12,207
Yes you oars, but they are right your hands,
one with the impression which you do not make large thing.

304
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:16,408
Ouais Robin is necessary to put to you at it more seriously.

305
00:19:16,675 --> 00:19:18,141
I do my better.

306
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:20,542
It does not have the practice of this kind of thing.

307
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,007
This rate/rhythm one can go directly on arrival…

308
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,208
Or they are run?

309
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:30,342
An easy victory is not a bad idea.

310
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:32,475
But this woman humiliated me…

311
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:36,075
I will not let myself walk above without stumbling…

312
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,408
The race beats full sound!

313
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:44,742
At the head of the race we have the “Cutie
Coach " followed by “Barrel Tiger”…

314
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,542
and in third position, “Kami Kure”.

315
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,875
Hein? “Kami Kure” is not there any more?

316
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:51,542
It is there!

317
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,542
Shit.

318
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,608
How this type made to run us so quickly?

319
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:59,607
Which reversal of situation?
“Kami Kure” is except race!

320
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:01,608
How that occurred, it is…!

321
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:07,275
Ohh! Ohh! Idles now.

322
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:08,941
The changing is taken.

323
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,142
How do they make to go so quickly?

324
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,808
I cannot about it any more…

325
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,208
They stopped.

326
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:22,408
“niinii giri gee ahh”

327
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,475
It was forgotten that the ocean drains its forces to him.

328
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:27,475
is necessary to recover to row, or one will lose the head.

329
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,874
I of insane of what it was,
one will not lose vis-a-vis you.

330
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,942
Shit, they still doubled us.

331
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,742
They have surprised me one moment but
they will not catch up with us any more.

332
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,075
How?

333
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:38,741
What do you say that?

334
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:39,942
Super, Robin!

335
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:41,875
Dirty cheaters!

336
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,075
Release us!

337
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:46,542
They already found.

338
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:48,008
Kabouti?

339
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:51,608
Salt plague!

340
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:54,742
Luffy! You could remake it, would be this only one moment.

341
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:58,275
I have well the impression that one will not be able
to count on him for a small moment.

342
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,542
It is necessary that the race is continued.

343
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:03,475
If one does not stop discussing
with them, one is likely to lose.

344
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:05,408
You are right, one takes again the race.

345
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:08,875
I believe that one should run them
good once for all.

346
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:17,008
I see that the difficulties arrive, there is
first of all the long coral barrier.

347
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,275
Followed the “Long one Wraps”…

348
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:22,542
Where the swirl “Long Boxing ring resides”!

349
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:26,875
How will they be left there? But what it is?!

350
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:28,008
What?

351
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:30,408
I see two silhouettes on the island!

352
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:34,274
He, sitting there on Hamburger.

353
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:36,274
What a plume!

354
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,542
The génialissime!

355
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,941
The pitiless one!

356
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,608
Our démoniaque Oyabi.

357
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:45,542

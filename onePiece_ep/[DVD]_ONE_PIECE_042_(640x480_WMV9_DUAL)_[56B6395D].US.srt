1
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:55,498
Do you know what the difference
Is between you and me?

2
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,181
Nose...

3
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:01,838
Chin...

4
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:02,881
Oh, the webs!

5
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,425
It's our very race!

6
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,384
It's our very race!

7
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:19,564
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

8
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:19,898
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

9
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:20,565
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

10
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:20,815
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

11
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:21,274
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

12
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:21,733
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

13
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:22,067
That idiot, he'll bite off his own tongue!

14
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:23,943
His teeth must be...

15
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:24,152
His teeth must be...

16
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,698
He bit that column to pieces!

17
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:29,199
He bit that column to pieces!

18
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,449
He bit that column to pieces!

19
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,408
He bit that column to pieces!

20
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:45,298
BURSTING OUT! MERMAN ARLONG
FEARSOME ATTACK FROM THE SEA!

21
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:45,423
BURSTING OUT! MERMAN ARLONG
FEARSOME ATTACK FROM THE SEA!

22
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,432
See now?

23
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,309
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

24
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,643
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

25
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:56,935
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

26
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:57,185
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

27
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:57,477
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

28
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:57,727
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

29
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:58,061
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

30
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:58,469
This is the true power we mermen are born with!

31
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:03,817
The Heavens only gave you humans
enough strength to exist below us.

32
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:04,943
You are inferior creatures!

33
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,820
You are inferior creatures!

34
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:11,116
From the very moment we were
born, everything was different!

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,087
Allow me to show you just
how different we really are.

36
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:26,047
Sure, show me.

37
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,007
But I won't lose to the likes of you.

38
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:28,883
'Coz I'm the man who'll become the Pirate King!

39
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:29,759
'Coz I'm the man who'll become the Pirate King!

40
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,927
'Coz I'm the man who'll become the Pirate King!

41
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,114
Pirate King?

42
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:53,116
Don't make me laugh.

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,954
You think a mere human like you
can become someone like that?

44
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,623
Can you bite through that column with your power?

45
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,255
To simply bite through a solid stone column
like he did... no human could do that.

46
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:11,709
Those teeth... wouldn't just leave
scars if he got bitten...

47
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,659
It'd go through and break his bones, too!

48
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,773
So what?!

49
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:31,780
Don't try showing off... with things that don't matter!

50
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,952
I can break that column without having to bite it.

51
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:45,043
Oh! Well said, Luffy-aniki!

52
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,420
You got it! In the end, the results the same!

53
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,549
You're so stupid!

54
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,553
The whole human race is pathetic!

55
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,723
You can't even save yourself in the ocean.

56
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:00,100
You can't do anything!

57
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:07,482
And when I can't do anything,
I have others to help me!

58
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,490
Huh? He can use swords, too?

59
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,370
Take that, and that, and that!

60
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,080
What the hell are you doing now?
Take that, and that, and that!

61
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,667
You're just waving them around.

62
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,626
You're just waving them around.

63
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,554
I'm not interested in fooling around with you.

64
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:48,732
This is boring.

65
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:49,357
Then eat this!!

66
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,775
Then eat this!!

67
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:15,717
Arlong's teeth broke!

68
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:24,384
Of course I don't know a damn thing
about swords, you dumbass!

69
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,812
Wha... what's he talking about?

70
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,643
I don't know how to navigate, either.

71
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,146
I can't cook.

72
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,858
I can't even lie!

73
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:41,951
Hey.

74
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:47,040
I know that I need others to HELP
me if I want to keep on living!

75
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:56,132
You sure are useless... How pitiful.

76
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,638
And such a pathetic guy is their captain?

77
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,724
They must really resent you.

78
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:10,939
Why should they risk their lives
to save someone like you?

79
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:17,153
Someone they can't be proud of,
why should you be their captain?

80
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,989
What can you do?

81
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,535
I can beat the crap out of ya!

82
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,793
That goes without saying, piece of shit...

83
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,546
If you get yourself killed, I'll kill you.

84
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:37,215
Yeah! I'll back you up!

85
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,217
Yeah! All right!

86
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,635
Kick his ass, rubberman!

87
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,429
Go Luffy-aniki!

88
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,264
Go get him!

89
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:48,226
SHUT UP! You've got to be joking, weaklings!

90
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,021
Eh? His teeth grew back!

91
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:53,606
Because I'm a shark.

92
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:59,320
My teeth will grow back over and over...
with stronger ones everytime!

93
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,362
My teeth will grow back over and over...
with stronger ones everytime!

94
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,950
However many times...

95
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,125
As many times as I need.

96
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:22,969
This is a trait that the Heavens have given to me.

97
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,097
COOL!

98
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:31,644
Are you beginning to understand
just how superior I am?

99
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:31,853
Are you beginning to understand
just how superior I am?

100
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,276
TWIST GUM!

101
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,076
Whoa, stop that!

102
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:56,377
Luffy-aniki!

103
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:10,809
A-Arlong-san... it hurts...

104
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:11,309
M-my kinsman!

105
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,561
M-my kinsman!

106
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,151
Why you, rubber bastard...

107
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,737
How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield!

108
00:09:22,737 --> 00:09:23,279
How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield!

109
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:23,738
How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield!

110
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:24,280
How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield!

111
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,781
How dare you use one of my kinsmen as a shield!

112
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:26,866
What're you talking about?

113
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,202
You're the one who attacked him.

114
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,080
You had me worried there.

115
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,879
Stand still, rubber bastard!

116
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:44,467
Heh, I just thought of a good idea.

117
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:45,927
An idea?

118
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:47,887
What could it be?

119
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,640
Does he have some kind of special attack?

120
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,227
TWIST GUM!

121
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:21,629
They came out!

122
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:30,430
Idiot, I told you that it doesn't matter
how many times you break my teeth.

123
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,768
Don't you get it yet?!

124
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:39,981
Luffy-aniki, could your idea have to do with..?

125
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:43,318
Look! Now I have 'em, too!

126
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,870
I-It wasn't a special attack?!

127
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,665
I figured he'd do something stupid like that.

128
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:06,007
How long do you intend to keep fooling around?

129
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,055
Ah! I was bit by a shark!

130
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:14,516
'COZ YOU'RE FOOLING AROUND!

131
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,435
Who's fooling around? I'm dead serious!

132
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:19,729
TWIST GUM!

133
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:44,504
Bitten again!

134
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,265
How's that? Getting bit by your own teeth?

135
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:57,058
Sha-hahaha!

136
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,269
Even if they are mine...

137
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,606
Your jaw's far too weak!

138
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:10,363
Listen, sharks tear flesh and limbs
from the body of its prey.

139
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,615
That's what a shark's true power is!

140
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:15,410
No! Aniki's bones will be broken!

141
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:15,660
No! Aniki's bones will be broken!

142
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,536
No! Aniki's bones will be broken!

143
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:16,911
No! Aniki's bones will be broken!

144
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:17,746
No! Aniki's bones will be broken!

145
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:18,830
Luffy!

146
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:30,258
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

147
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:37,307
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

148
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,606
I-Is his arm alright?

149
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,069
He was one step away from being eaten!

150
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:36,032
I can't imagine what it feels like to
be bitten by that beast's fangs.

151
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,627
Aniki's elbow, you think it's okay?

152
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:07,313
Huh? Where is he?

153
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,692
Luffy! In the water!

154
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:11,735
The water?

155
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:15,655
Oh! A shark!

156
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,700
That's ARLONG, dummy!

157
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,124
Huh? He dove down.

158
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,168
This is bad.

159
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:31,838
They grow more powerful in the water!

160
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:40,305
No one can surpass my speed in the water.

161
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:45,310
This is a special trait that only we mermen have.

162
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,271
Is he running away?

163
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:00,158
SHARK ON DARTS!!

164
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,537
SHARK ON DARTS!!

165
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,128
What the!

166
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,880
A torpedo?

167
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:20,095
Something shot out from the sea!

168
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,105
Oh?

169
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,816
You dodged that well.

170
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:40,490
But dodging is just dodging, the
next one will send you to hell!

171
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:47,747
SHARK ON DARTS!!

172
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,095
W-What's that shark freak made of?

173
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,389
He even crushed the floor!

174
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:09,102
SHARK ON DARTS!!

175
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:26,077
Hey, Luffy! Hide!

176
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:28,246
He went back into the water!

177
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:32,751
Aniki, hurry and hide!

178
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:35,128
He's gonna attack again!

179
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:40,884
RUN!!

180
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:45,930
No.

181
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,641
What are you saying, you moron?!

182
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,019
You wanna just stand there and
be an easy target? Go and hide!

183
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:52,395
No!

184
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:55,398
I'm gonna break that nose of his!

185
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,567
Bring it on!

186
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,110
Sharky!

187
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:04,115
Heh. You've got guts!

188
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:08,328
Or, maybe you've finally realized
that you have no escape?

189
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,760
What part of ''hiding'' do you not understand, Luffy?

190
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,836
You just got lucky before and barely dodged it!

191
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:20,465
But if he hits you this time, you're doomed!

192
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:24,589
GOMU GOMU NO...

193
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,474
What's that stance?

194
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:31,601
Does he really think that'll stop him?

195
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:31,810
Does he really think that'll stop him?

196
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,063
I have twice the distance to accelerate.

197
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,482
I'll pierce your heart this time!

198
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:42,445
SHARK ON DARTS!!

199
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,036
Stabbed!

200
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,051
What? Is he dead?

201
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:07,929
No, he got away in time!

202
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,601
I stopped your li'l trick, so I guess
you can't use it anymore!

203
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:17,063
SHARK ON DARTS!!

204
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:25,780
You dork, haven't you used enough of that?

205
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,657
You're finished!

206
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,284
Take this!

207
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,537
GOMU GOMU NO

208
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:37,000
Fishing! Let's fish!

209
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:44,132
And now...

210
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:49,012
YARI!

211
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,400
He did it!!

212
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,945
Good job!

213
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,073
Oh? Is he dead?

214
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:15,121
Arlong's eyes have changed!

215
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:19,375
That's what people said happened to the ''Sea
King's'' eyes when they were attacked...

216
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:24,589
...that he changed and went berserk!

217
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:28,343
Arlong... with those eyes... I've
never seen him like this!

218
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,638
You inferior human!

219
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:39,187
How did you do this to me, a merman!?

220
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,285
Man, that shook me up.

221
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:57,831
I don't think he's hurt, but he sure is angry.

222
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:10,468
What's that?

223
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,761
Kiribachi!

224
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,097
With huge teeth!

225
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:39,914
Luffy-aniki! Run! Watch out!

226
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:40,874
He won't stop. There,s no way out of this!
Luffy-aniki! Run! Watch out!

227
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,292
He won't stop. There,s no way out of this!
It's dangerous!!

228
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:42,542
It's dangerous!!

229
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,801
They went inside.

230
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:02,187
Top floor... left window.

231
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,815
That room is...

232
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:08,860
That was close.

233
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,781
Now you have no where to run.

234
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:18,453
This is the top floor of Arlong Park.

235
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:22,582
Looks like your last moments have come.

236
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:25,001
What's with this room?

237
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:27,337
It's full of paper.

238
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:29,756
Not just any ordinary paper!

239
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,007
This is the map room.

240
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,260
The room for that girl to draw her maps.

241
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:36,888
The cartography room!

242
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,766
Nami's room?

243
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:44,396
All of them are sea maps that Nami drew for me.

244
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,108
It's impressive, isn't it?

245
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,944
Her eight years of work. My treasure.

246
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:59,702
We know the sea like the back of our hands,
but it's hard for us to make maps.

247
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:03,123
We needed a skilled cartographer.

248
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,918
Then I found that girl, with her talented eye!

249
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:09,546
That girl's a genius.

250
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:12,465
You won't find anyone who can
draw more accurately...

251
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:15,844
She's too good to serve you humans!

252
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,808
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

253
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,981
Nami is our nakama.

254
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:29,983
Nakama?

255
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,654
Just stay out of our way!

256
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:37,073
You rubber bastard!

257
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:40,493
What? What's with that look?!

258
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,245
She's...

259
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:45,039
Nami is...

260
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:51,379
OUR NAVIGATOR!

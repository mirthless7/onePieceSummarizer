1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Say a spell in your chest

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,440
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,750
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Singing from our hearts.

18
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

19
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
Negai nara chiisana mune no naka

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Kibou de jumon o

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
Kakereba...

24
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Kasoku shita yokan

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Nanairo no onpukana de

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Issho ni konai ka?

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
Bokura datenshi

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
Yume ni ya o hanatsu no sa

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
Kobaruto buruu ni

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,440
Naniiro o kasanete ikou?

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
Hitomi ni utsutta kanashii riaru o kowase

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,750
Nukumori tsuki no hane o ageyou

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Shuuru na datenshi

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Kokoro kara utau no sa

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,920
Wealth.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Fame.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,180
Power.

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,530
The man who once owned everything,

39
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,110
The Pirate King,

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,410
Gold Roger.

41
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,440
The words he said before his death,

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,350
Sent all the people of the world...

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,870
Out to the seas.

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,750
My treasure?

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,540
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,240
Find it!

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,840
I left everything in that place.

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,890
Men, searching for romance,

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,810
Pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,610
The world is now

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,940
In the Grand Age of Pirates!

52
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,900
Oh, I've got it!

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,110
What?

54
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,980
We can...

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,960
If I'm here, we can save Robin!

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,690
Dammit!

57
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,480
"Dammit?" Can't you do this without getting worked up?

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,570
Let's hurry, Nami-kun!

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,970
How many times have I told you?

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,540
You don't even have a shred of hope left!

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,410
We heard a voice earlier, but nobody's gonna come!

62
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,340
Lucci's taking that guy down right now!

63
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,740
It seems we don't agree.

64
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,140
It doesn't matter what you do.

65
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,470
I don't have time for this...

66
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,980
Gomu gomu no gatling!

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,730
Stamp!

68
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,440
Muchi!

69
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,440
Muchi: Whip

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,070
Yari!

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,070
Yari: Spear

72
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,580
I'm a wolf!

73
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,780
I'll chase you down 'til I catch you and eat you!

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,640
What, you were alive?

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,550
I don't intend to run...

76
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,120
I don't intend to be killed...

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,010
I don't intend to forgive you.

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,710
Forgive me?

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,360
You're doing that for Nico Robin?

80
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,380
That kind of feeling's only gonna get in your way in a fight.

81
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,350
If you've got the time to pity that stupid, hopeless woman,

82
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,740
You should think of a way to get out of here alive!

83
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,120
Be careful what you say...

84
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,080
When I get mad, I heat up...

85
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,130
This is the same power as the devil.

86
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,000
Diable Jambe...

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
W-wait!

88
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
Flambage...

89
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,720
Flambage: Flaming

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,630
Shot!

91
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,910
Cooking is a gift from the gods...

92
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,990
Spices are a gift from the devil.

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,280
Looks like it was a little too spicy for you.

94
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,970
A Furious Attack of Drawn Swords!

95
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,990
Zoro vs. Kaku: Powerful Slashing Duel

96
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,530
Onigiri!

97
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,530
Onigiri: Demon slash

98
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,620
The giraffe and the marimo...

99
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,740
Are they trying to collapse this tower?

100
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,620
This is...

101
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,040
"Gate of Justice"...

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,850
If I follow this, can I get there?

103
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,370
Nami-san probably already went to where Robin-chan is.

104
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,620
I need to hurry and get this number one key over there too...

105
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,400
I should go.

106
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,460
Hurry and come on!

107
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,760
We're finally here... on the Bridge of Hesitation!

108
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,590
Look, Nico Robin!

109
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,940
Do you see?

110
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,410
The Gate of Justice is opening.

111
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,340
It's taken a long time...

112
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,440
It's really taken a long time!

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,160
But I finally made it!

114
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Once I pass through the gate, I'll be the government's-

115
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,720
No, the world's hero!

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,140
The bridge leading to the gate itself is being raised now.

117
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,750
It's waiting for the hero!

118
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,380
Wonderful!

119
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,620
Just look at this path to a brilliant future!

120
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,360
Well, to you it's more of a path to hell.

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,040
Isn't that what you think?

122
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,330
Nico Robin!

123
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,100
Oi, what?

124
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,640
Ow...

125
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,180
Oi, wait!

126
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,650
Why you...

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Stop this now, dammit!

128
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,670
You still don't get it?

129
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,700
You can't get away!

130
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,590
Do you know who I am?

131
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,450
I'm the world's hero.

132
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,160
The world's hero!

133
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,960
There's no hope for you!

134
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,290
I'm completely different from someone as horrible as you!

135
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm a man full of hope and dreams!

136
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,550
Do you understand, you stupid woman?

137
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,680
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

138
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,190
Luffy... Everyone...

139
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,320
Everyone...!

140
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,280
Hurry, hurry!

141
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,490
There's no point if I don't make it in time.

142
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,850
What's that?

143
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,880
10 minutes until arrival at our destination!

144
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,790
All ships confirm your positions.

145
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,610
Yessir!

146
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,630
Come on!

147
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,760
Walk!

148
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,100
Let's go, Nico Robin!

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
Is this the exit?

150
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,570
You- Strawhat!

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,780
Franky!

152
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,020
Bastard, why're you here?!

153
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,200
Now's not the time to be mad at me, idiot!

154
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm on your side for now.

155
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,670
Just give it up!

156
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,170
Lucci's here?

157
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,970
Are you having trouble with him?

158
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,330
Where's Nico Robin?

159
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,930
I brought two of the keys.

160
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,640
You need help?

161
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,550
No...

162
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,740
More importantly...

163
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,390
Please stop Robin!

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,650
You can get to the Gate of Justice through the door behind pigeon-guy!

165
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,400
Robin already got taken through!

166
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,300
I'll take care of him.

167
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,240
Just leave it to me, bastard!

168
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,510
If you asked me...

169
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,720
I'd tell you that I prefer meat!

170
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,770
I already said I don't care, herbivore.

171
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,640
But for now I've gotta get your key.

172
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,020
If I don't make it in time, it's the same as losing.

173
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,200
Nitouryuu

174
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,200
Nitouryuu: Two-sword style

175
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,450
Nigiri.

176
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,450
Nigiri: Two slices

177
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,870
If you wear that bandanna, are you more powerful?

178
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,460
I dunno.

179
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Tourou!

180
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
Tourou: Climbing a tower

181
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,040
Outourou!

182
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,040
Outourou: Reply climbing a tower

183
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,760
Hirameki!

184
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,760
Hirameki: Flash

185
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,500
Samon!

186
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,500
Samon: Sand figure

187
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,240
If you're in the air, you're done for!

188
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,150
Kama Kirin!

189
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,150
Kama Kirin: Scythe giraffe

190
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,630
Tekkai "Mushikaku"

191
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,630
Mushikaku: No weak spots

192
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,160
What?!

193
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,470
Even though I'm a "cube," I have no "weak spots."

194
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,470
Both "cube" and "weak spots" are pronounced the same way (shikaku), so this is a pun.

195
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,560
Shut up, what the hell're you doing?!

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,160
How naive...

197
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
Haven't you realized?

198
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,480
What?

199
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,560
Giraffes have four legs.

200
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,010
Rankyaku.

201
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,900
Are you even trying to fight?!

202
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,910
Where are you looking?

203
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,660
The attack has already begun.

204
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,660
The attacks will bounce off the ceiling, and rain down...

205
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,000
Kiri Shigure!

206
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,000
Kiri Shigure: Giraffe autumn rain

207
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,380
Tekkai.

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,830
Throwing attacks around...

209
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,520
Shit!

210
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,690
I can't block!

211
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,040
Bigan!

212
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,940
...Bastard...

213
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,890
What a strong man.

214
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm surprised.

215
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,530
I've trained, Giraffe-Jar.

216
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,530
This entire conversation is a pun on Kaku's bizarre speech patterns, and it unfortunately loses most of its humor when translated.

217
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,290
Giraffe-Jar?

218
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm a giraffe.

219
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,390
Giraffe-Jar.

220
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,170
No, I'm a giraffe!

221
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,670
Shut up!

222
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,460
"Giraffe-Jar", "I'm a giraffe"...

223
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,550
It's just annoying, it doesn't matter which it is!

224
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,270
You'll pay for insulting me.

225
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,200
And you should prepare yourself.

226
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,480
Playtime is over.

227
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,550
First, that "tekkai"...

228
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,990
I'll break it!

229
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,730
That's pretty funny.

230
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,680
You'll break tekkai?

231
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,640
Can you do that?

232
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,080
Yeah, of course.

233
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,860
Should I try?

234
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
Ittouryuu

235
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
Ittouryuu: One-sword style

236
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,780
Iai...

237
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,780
Iai: Sword style in which one draws their sword, attacks, and then sheaths the sword, all in one motion.

238
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,830
Shishi Sonson!

239
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,830
Shishi Sonson: Lion song

240
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,090
Rankyaku...

241
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,770
Roudan!

242
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,770
Roudan: Dragon cut

243
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,640
Could you have cut it if it was steel?

244
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,490
I'm the one who decides whether or not to use tekkai.

245
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,710
Really?

246
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,780
Then I'm gonna have to go about this differently.

247
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,280
Ichi Gorilla...

248
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,280
Ichi: One

249
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,990
Ni Gorilla...

250
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,990
Ni: Two

251
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,250
Now, come.

252
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,450
Santouryuu...

253
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,130
This time it's a test of strength?

254
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,500
How interesting!

255
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,210
Bigan!

256
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,630
Ni-Gori Zake!

257
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,630
Zake: Slice

258
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,840
What a powerful attack!

259
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,330
Talking like that from such a high place...

260
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,500
You didn't even consider that you could be defeated too

261
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,950
You're too full of yourself!

262
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,400
You are as well!

263
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,630
Gomu Gomu no Gatling!

264
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,990
Kami-e.

265
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,890
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!

266
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,560
Soru.

267
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,410
Strawhat!

268
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,780
Rankyaku.

269
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,460
Weapons Left!

270
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,710
What?

271
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,090
Gomu Gomu no Rocket!

272
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,760
What?

273
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,690
Gomu Gomu no Bazooka!

274
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,500
Strawhat!

275
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,180
Yosh.

276
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,940
Just don't move!

277
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,870
Wait!

278
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,810
Don't do anything stupid!

279
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,070
Just go!

280
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,120
I told you I'd take care of him!

281
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,680
Take care of him?

282
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,270
Aren't you being stupid?

283
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,270
Let's just work together!

284
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,030
Franky!

285
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,660
This guy's my opponent.

286
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,420
I have to defeat him!

287
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,320
I'll say it one more time:

288
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,970
You hurry and go to Robin!

289
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,380
And please stop her!

290
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,690
If you don't, Robin will be gone!

291
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,890
If we don't get her back, we'll lose her!

292
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,620
You...

293
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,520
Stop, Sea Train!

294
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,750
Give back Tom-san!

295
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,690
Impossible.

296
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,490
I won't let you escape.

297
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,930
Strawhat...

298
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,500
Hurry!

299
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,500
GO!

300
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,000
...You...

301
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,540
Got it!

302
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,630
Didn't I say...

303
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,090
I wouldn't let you escape?

304
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,840
Geppou!

305
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,300
Soru!

306
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,640
What?

307
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,350
Shigan.

308
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,900
I already told you...

309
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,030
I'm your opponent!

310
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,090
You still haven't seen...

311
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,910
A giraffe's full potential.

312
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,740
Enough talk.

313
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,540
Show me.

314
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,540
You don't need to tell me.

315
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,670
Watch the power of a giraffe carefully...

316
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,450
Kirin Houdai!

317
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,450
Kirin Houdai: Giraffe cannon

318
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,590
There's no giraffes like that.

319
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,810
Kyoku Bigan.

320
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,810
Kyoku: Extreme

321
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,390
Kiriman Jaro!

322
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,390
Kiriman Jaro: Giraffe-man fire oar, also a pun with Mount Kilimanjaro

323
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,140
It stretched?!

324
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,040
I shouldn't even have to tell you...

325
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,530
But that long neck of yours is your weak spot!

326
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,200
No it isn't!

327
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,660
Rankyaku "Neji Hakujin!"

328
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,660
Neji Hakujin: Screw drawn sword

329
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,370
You're the one who has weak spots.

330
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,080
What the hell kinda animal is he?

331
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,340
This time you won't escape.

332
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,790
Kirin Houdai!

333
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,420
Oh no, I pulled my neck in too far so my legs stretched out!

334
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,300
What the hell is with your body?!

335
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:21,770
Just like wheat being turned into pasta in a pasta machine!

336
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,000
Pasta Machine!

337
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,740
Don't name your attacks now!

338
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,050
A long neck is nice, but there are many uses for long arms and legs as well...

339
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,500
I'm an expert at taking even the most unexpected of situations and using it to my advantage!

340
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,400
Watch!

341
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,460
The attacks I can use with this new reach...

342
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,190
Kiriman Jaro!

343
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,880
Was that all you could think of?!

344
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,340
This is too much talking...

345
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,940
Santouryuu...

346
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,650
Tatsumaki!

347
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,640
Tatsumaki: Tornado

348
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,770
Tekkai!

349
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,110
Such power...

350
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,920
Soru!

351
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,070
Geppou!

352
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,570
He jumped to the floor above?

353
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,370
Pasta Machine!

354
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,170
I've made you wait.

355
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,740
My neck as well as my limbs...

356
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,210
If I can control all of their reaches at will,

357
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,050
I can fight as I like.

358
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,110
I'm a yontouryuu user!

359
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,110
Yontouryuu: Four-sword style

360
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,770
Like this, I can use the giraffe's power to its fullest!

361
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,570
You'll have no chance of winning!

362
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,660
Even if giraffes are the most powerful...

363
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,000
Even if you can fully use that annoying neck...

364
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,370
Even if you are a yontouryuu user...

365
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,110
What?

366
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,340
He stopped my swords?

367
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,060
You still have no chance of defeating me!

368
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,260
You're so full of yourself...

369
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,780
Kyuutouryuu!

370
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,780
Kyuutouryuu: Nine-sword style

371
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,010
Next time on One Piece:

372
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,100
Fierce God Zoro!

373
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,070
The Incarnation of Asura Shown by his Spirit

374
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

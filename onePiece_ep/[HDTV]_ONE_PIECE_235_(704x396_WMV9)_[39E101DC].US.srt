1
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,330
Does one have to continue Franky?

2
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,819
But where?

3
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,010
Good, they do not seem to know where is the money.

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,740
Even if one ends up catching this Franky, he already very spends.

5
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,829
What will one make?

6
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,020
While remaining here, one can await it still a long time.

7
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,949
Ca is not used for nothing to chatter longer.

8
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,689
In any case, let us turn over to the boat.

9
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,300
Nami-san remained all alone.

10
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,010
It misses Robin-chan, too.

11
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,840
There is also the problem of the boat.

12
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,610
Oi, Luffy!

13
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,490
About the boat…

14
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,300
I made my decision…

15
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,480
It is time to separate from Merry!

16
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:02,180
Fights with the moonlight!
Tears of the pirate boat!

17
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,139
Oooi! Usopp is awaked!

18
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,020
Really?! It is brilliant!

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,200
Which relief.

20
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,380
Oi, Usopp!

21
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,420
Robin-chan did not return yet.

22
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,780
Cretin, will not cause us more concern!

23
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,689
Ouais, you is nutcase to be there gone all alone.

24
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,310
Estimate yourself happy to be in life.

25
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,019
Reflected before acting.

26
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,580
You did not make the weight!

27
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,199
I bring only troubles to you.

28
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,919
Afflicted…

29
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,420
I am really…

30
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,270
What a shame! The guy!

31
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,849
All our money… I… I…

32
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,909
He, wait, calms itself!

33
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,639
I included/understood, releases me!

34
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,099
But, all the money that we had finally collected is…

35
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,209
Usopp, you must still rest.

36
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,140
Ca is enough now, do what Chopper says you.

37
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,280
Then it is what I thought…

38
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,320
We will never find the money.

39
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,070
In fact, one will know nothing as long as this Franky will not return.

40
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,330
I include/understand… I am sorry.

41
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,340
It is not serious if we do not find it, we always have 100 million, then do not worry you.

42
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,310
If, it is serious!

43
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,070
Nami.

44
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,940
Afflicted.

45
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,400
Not, it is nothing.

46
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,170
On this subject, Luffy…

47
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,680
The ship, which will become Merry?

48
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,210
Will we be able despite everything to repair it with this 100 million?

49
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,129
After all this time, we can finally repair it in this famous shipyard.

50
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,829
We will be able to repair it completely and to make it more robust…

51
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,229
It will be able to then sail again.

52
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,920
Isn't He, 100 million Berrys, that enough?

53
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,529
With what you do think, Luffy?

54
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,720
And well, with that…

55
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,290
Usopp, we decided to change boat.

56
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,429
Afflicted to have taken this decision in your absence.

57
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,309
But the decision was made.

58
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,119
Merry helped us much…

59
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,800
But the voyage with this boat stops here.

60
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,400
In any event…

61
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,989
In the catalog of Ice-ossan…

62
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,509
There is full with other boats which we can buy.

63
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,569
With 100 million, we can treat to a larger boat of occasion.

64
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,770
Wait…

65
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,969
Wait, wait…

66
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:16,079
He… It is a joke, not?

67
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,159
He, look at, Chopper believed there.

68
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
Our captain is not if defaitist.

69
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,540
Say it to him, Nami.

70
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,129
What? There is not enough money to repair it?

71
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,819
It is because they took the money to me?

72
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,489
We do not have enough any more of money, it is that?

73
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,409
It is that, Luffy?

74
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,059
A boat of quality is inevitably expensive, it is normal.

75
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,739
Not, not, that does not have anything to see!

76
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,689
Then it is what? Say to me!

77
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,229
You want to make me Peter leads?

78
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,359
Of course that not! The money does not have any importance!

79
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
Then it is what? Stop with your conneries of change of boat!

80
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,729
Oi, stop both! What good is it to dispute?!

81
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,730
You calm before speaking!

82
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,369
I cannot calm myself with such conneries!

83
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,889
He, the hour is serious but it is not worthwhile to be irritated like that.

84
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,719
Yes, Usopp. You must rest, your body will not support.

85
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,459
I of insane!

86
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,189
Ca returns nutcase to me to see this captain making decisions with the light one.

87
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,649
Pas à la light! I suffered before making this decision!

88
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,839
How can you suffer and finally decide that?!

89
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,170
Except me that of the sight!

90
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,319
What you make?!

91
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,119
What a horror!

92
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,019
Oi, Luffy! If it is not because of the money, then it is what, Luffy?!

93
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,999
Say to me!

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,969
Go, why you do not say anything?!

95
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,329
Do not occupy you of me, and say to me!

96
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,589
Say it! But I hope that the reason is valid!

97
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,550
Merry is not any more…

98
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,130
What did you say?

99
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,109
You included/understood very well.

100
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,190
Merry is not reparable any more.

101
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,040
Never…

102
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,740
I will not have said such a thing if it were not the case!

103
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,740
It is THIS boat, this boat on which we are in this moment even!

104
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,380
Yes, this boat is about to run!

105
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,479
What do you say, Luffy?

106
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,600
It is the truth. It is what they said to the shipyard.

107
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,940
They said that it would not even reach the next island.

108
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,010
I see… One would not reach…

109
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,119
You returned, convinced by people that you hardly know?

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,580
What?

111
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,030
It has is enough that famous engineers say that to you…

112
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,620
Awake!!

113
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,199
This boat on which we travelled so much all this time…

114
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,409
A companion who resisted the waves and the combat…

115
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,940
Hope you to let it die here?!

116
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,880
It is that which you want for this boat, Luffy?!

117
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,389
Usopp, that is not used for nothing to shout so extremely.

118
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,050
Remain apart from all that.

119
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,579
The conversation is not finished.

120
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,210
Usopp.

121
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,270
What do you decide then?

122
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,239
We do not have a naval engineer in the crew. It is for that one asked them to throw an eye there!

123
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,739
Then they is good, one does not need more to require anything of them!

124
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,569
I will repair it myself, as I always did.

125
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,509
One makes like that since the beginning.

126
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,099
Yosh, I will start immediately.

127
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,239
Oi, come to help me.

128
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,029
Oi, await Usopp.

129
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,949
Ah yes it is true, it misses boards.

130
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,579
Let us buy some with the shipyard.

131
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,969
One will have job.

132
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,529
You are not naval engineer, Usopp!

133
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,280
He, Luffy!

134
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,849
I know, and then?!

135
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,939
It is to have the opinion of an engineer better!

136
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,789
But I do not rely on engineers who would drop a boat like that!

137
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,340
Usopp…

138
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,999
What wants to say that we must protect our boat ourself.

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,630
I…

140
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,230
WILL NEVER GIVE UP THIS BOAT!

141
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,299
You become nutcase?!

142
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,450
You were influenced by a band of engineers!

143
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,179
People whom I knew…

144
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,810
Would have relied on the force of Merry…

145
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,349
Rather than to listen to these balivernes!

146
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,100
To drop like a poor old man.

147
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,359
And to believe captain… do not generate the good decisions?!

148
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,860
I badly judged you, Luffy!

149
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,319
He, wait, Usopp. Luffy also…

150
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,880
Keep silent yourself, Nami! I made my decision!

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,129
I will not change an opinion!

152
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,889
We will change boat no matter what you say!

153
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,849
We will leave from here without Merry!

154
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,729
Firm! I will not let to you make!

155
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,089
Listen, Luffy…

156
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,869
It is not by trailing the feet as that one leaves oneself there!

157
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,869
I cannot leave from here while giving up a companion!

158
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,119
Anything, a boat is not the same thing!

159
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,199
It is similar!

160
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,689
Merry is alive and still has forces!

161
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,339
You are in a hurry probably already to have your next boat!

162
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,709
Oi, the guys, remain calm!

163
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,129
Ca will not arrange anything to be irritated like that!

164
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,759
DECREE CA IMMEDIATELY!

165
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,999
Luffy!

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,929
Do not imagine you that you are the only one to spend a dirty moment!

167
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,539
One feels all the same thing!

168
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,489
It is not question of changing boat!

169
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,529
Of agreement, then if my decision is not liked…

170
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,410
You have only to leave this immediate boat…

171
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,270
Sanji!

172
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,320
Bandage cretins.

173
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,939
You ridges what, there?!

174
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,139
One calms oneself! Did not say anything!

175
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,030
You included/understood, Luffy?!

176
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,039
I am sorry.

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,989
I did not want to say that…

178
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,109
Not, they is good, Luffy.

179
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,329
You let speak your heart.

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,850
What?!

181
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,730
You do nothing but progress, by throwing the useless companions.

182
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,550
If you give up Merry…

183
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,290
Give up me with.

184
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:57,290
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

185
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,130
You do nothing but progress…

186
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,739
By throwing the useless companions.

187
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,560
If you give up Merry…

188
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,999
Give up me with.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,279
Oi, Usopp, do not say stupidities!

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,870
Not, I am serious. I reflect there since one moment already.

191
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:26,350
Gradually, I understood that I anything was not compared with your superhuman force.

192
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,850
Today, I was unable to protect a little money.

193
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,790
Henceforth, I am only one ball for you, the guy.

194
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,820
You does not want the weak one among you, isn't this?

195
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,910
Luffy, you will become the Lord of the pirates.

196
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,870
But your ambitions are too large for me.

197
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:01,060
When I wanted to leave at sea, you invited me.

198
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,509
What do you tell? Hurry to go up.

199
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,850
We are already companions, not?

200
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,820
You are my only bonds of fastener.

201
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,100
When our opinions do not agree any more, we should not travel any more together!

202
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,250
Oi, where you go, Usopp?!

203
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,670
Ca does not look at you.

204
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,630
Ca does not concern you any more.

205
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,600
I…

206
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,150
I leave this crew!

207
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,150
Usopp.

208
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,680
Impossible.

209
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,889
He, await you what Luffy?!

210
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,489
You hope to let it leave?! He!

211
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,830
Catch up with it! Quickly, seek Usopp!

212
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,520
Ca is not done only it leaves like that…

213
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,020
After having travelled all this time together?

214
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,180
Isn't Usopp, an invaluable companion?

215
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,370
SEEK IT!

216
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,400
He Luffy.

217
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,100
Aren't you the captain?

218
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,000
Why you do not say anything?

219
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,780
Usopp!

220
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,549
Wait, do not do that!

221
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,439
He, is turned over!

222
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,059
Oi, return!

223
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,690
Do not leave, Usopp!

224
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Please, return!

225
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,070
Luffy.

226
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
Luffy, I cannot remain any more in your company.

227
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,290
Afflicted for all these troubles that I brought to you.

228
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,790
The boat is your property, since which you are captain.

229
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,410
Then engagements against me.

230
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,670
Monkey D. Luffy.

231
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,870
ENGAGEMENTS me!

232
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,630
Do He, what you tell?

233
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,770
This evening, 10 hours, I will return.

234
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,690
Then we will fight for Merry.

235
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,609
I would beat you and will recover Merry.

236
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,860
And…

237
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,100
This moment, we will not have anything any more to say to us.

238
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,240
What is there? Stop making the idiots!

239
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,189
Why friends should fight?!

240
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,149
If one grants a little time to the problem, everyone will be calmed.

241
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,820
Usopp has right summer irritated by the conversation.

242
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,320
One cannot retrogress after such a discussion.

243
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,159
Of course that if!

244
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,210
If you will excuse yourself and speak to him, very will arrange itself!

245
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,800
I already said you…

246
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,210
It is too late.

247
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,660
Why?

248
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,510
Usopp is not insane at the point to risk its life for a small argument.

249
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,350
And if one cannot regulate that differently…

250
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,730
There are not the choice.

251
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,720
If you include/understand, go T.

252
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,319
Luffy.

253
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,719
As I thought it…

254
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,269
Did Franky Family come here during the day, not?

255
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,969
Hein? About what you do speak?

256
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,369
Why didn't you deal with them as long as it was still time?

257
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,699
Usopp would not have been made attack.

258
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,429
You would have better done of you to charge some rather than to go to make shopping!

259
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,739
As a cook, I need to buy the necessary one…

260
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,180
It is not the moment to discuss on top!

261
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,940
I intended enough to shout for today.

262
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,759
You do not beat any more for what it occurred.

263
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,199
Nami-san.

264
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,300
But it is this cretin…

265
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,880
Chopper, you have…

266
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,270
Run after Usopp?

267
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,680
I wanted to continue his care…

268
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,720
But it threw me.

269
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,880
Usopp rented a room in a town hall.

270
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,340
He said…

271
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,680
He said…

272
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,610
“We are not any more companions, turns over to the boat.”

273
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,450
All these good moments spent together appear to be transformed into lies.

274
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,449
In addition to that…

275
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,010
If something arrives at Robin…

276
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,830
I am afraid well that the crew…

277
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,510
Fly in glares.

278
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,290
The crew of the Straw hat.

279
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,380
Maaa, I do not remain places this evening from there.

280
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,280
It is 10 a.m. Usopp arrives.

281
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,880
The guy, do not go down from the boat!

282
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,400
Included/understood?!

283
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,849
It is there!

284
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,190
Usopp!

285
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,750
You came without fear.

286
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,669
Do not regret anything, it does not matter what it occurred.

287
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,940
Here the duel which you asked!

288
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,469
Of course.

289
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,249
Give all that you ace. I will overcome you.

290
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,749
I know already how I will beat you.

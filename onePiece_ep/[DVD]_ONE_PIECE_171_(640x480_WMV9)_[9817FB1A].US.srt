1
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:10,322
I shouldn't have come!

2
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:10,739
I shouldn't have come!

3
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,073
I shouldn't have come!

4
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:11,407
I shouldn't have come!

5
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:11,740
I shouldn't have come!

6
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,074
I shouldn't have come!

7
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:12,449
I shouldn't have come!

8
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:12,741
I shouldn't have come!

9
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:13,075
I shouldn't have come!

10
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:13,284
I shouldn't have come!

11
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,746
Come down from there at once.

12
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,748
You sassy Blue Sea dweller! I'll cut you down!

13
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:19,999
You sassy Blue Sea dweller! I'll cut you down!

14
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,333
You sassy Blue Sea dweller! I'll cut you down!

15
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,867
SIX FLOWERS!

16
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,867
TWIST!

17
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:31,927
What a cruel thing to do...

18
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:32,803
What a cruel thing to do...

19
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,941
Have you seen the Flying Blade Attack?

20
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,041
ONE-SWORD STYLE!

21
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,241
36-POUND CANNON!

22
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:16,341
HOWLING BURN BAZOOKA!!
LUFFY VS WAR DEMON WIPER

23
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:22,770
DAMMIT!

24
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,563
That guy...

25
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:28,525
He... killed Sanji first!

26
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:29,943
It's no good!

27
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:33,238
His heart stiII isn't beating!

28
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:34,531
Oi! Sanji!

29
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,992
Sanji!

30
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:37,576
Sanji!

31
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:38,535
Damn...

32
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,663
If only Chopper were here...

33
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:41,121
If only Chopper were here...

34
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,373
Wait a second, Usopp!

35
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,166
That's his right!

36
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,377
His heart's on left!

37
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:46,627
His heart's on left!

38
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:47,127
His heart's on left!

39
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:47,628
His heart's on left!

40
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:48,170
His heart's on left!

41
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,671
His heart's on left!

42
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,299
IT'S BEATING!

43
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,427
Thank goodness!

44
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,762
He's back from the dead!

45
00:03:57,388 --> 00:04:00,057
But this is serious! He might still die!

46
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:01,268
WHAT!?

47
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,768
CRAP!

48
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,228
THIS IS BAD!

49
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:11,485
Enel!

50
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,444
Enel!

51
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,532
You needn't be so resentful.

52
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:19,451
We have not seen each other in so long.

53
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,912
Why wouldn't you be happy about it?

54
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:24,331
Well Gan FalI?

55
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,882
H-Hey! Bastard!

56
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:36,760
What did you do to Sanji!?

57
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,139
J-J-J-Just try that again!

58
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,767
My 8,000 followers wiIl have
you surrounded in a heartbeat!

59
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:49,064
But... I-If you run away now, I-I'll let you live.

60
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:49,481
How about that?

61
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,274
How about that?

62
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,696
He... ran away?

63
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:05,914
Fiend!

64
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:07,332
Fiend!

65
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,175
Stay quiet...

66
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,177
...and I won't do anything.

67
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:21,138
understand?

68
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,352
Good.

69
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:30,052
Who is this guy!?

70
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:32,352
What did he just do!?

71
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:37,654
Just what do you mean by coming here?

72
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:43,327
In the si years since we took controI of this isIand

73
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:48,373
I've had your former subordinates working hard.

74
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,462
The Enforcers under my command...

75
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:53,712
The Enforcers under my command...

76
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:53,962
The Enforcers under my command...

77
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:54,087
The Enforcers under my command...

78
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,465
Their strength is impressive.

79
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:57,174
Their strength is impressive.

80
00:05:57,174 --> 00:06:00,010
Truly, men of talent.

81
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,722
But now these six de pressing years of hard labor...

82
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:06,600
...are finally coming to an end.

83
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:12,564
Consequently, so is my need for this island.

84
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:15,984
I have come here to bid you farewell.

85
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,403
That is all.

86
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:27,704
I must say, the people of Skypiea
are blissfully ignorant.

87
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:33,168
They see this island as nothing
more than a clump of Vearth.

88
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,003
What do you mean by that?

89
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:40,467
The reason we seized this isiand...

90
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,179
The reason the Blue Sea meddlers are here...

91
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,222
The reason the Blue Sea meddlers are here...

92
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:45,931
The reason the Blue Sea meddlers are here...

93
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:46,974
And the reason the Shandians
persistently try to take it back...

94
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,309
And the reason the Shandians
persistently try to take it back...

95
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,352
And the reason the Shandians
persistently try to take it back...

96
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,812
And the reason the Shandians
persistently try to take it back...

97
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:52,396
And the reason the Shandians
persistently try to take it back...

98
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:58,402
In other words, the one reason
anyone seeks to claim this island!

99
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:05,200
We seek the city that flourished on this
island long ago on the Blue Sea

100
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,273
The legendary City of Gold

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,473
The last remnants of Shandra!

102
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,752
Gold?

103
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,879
What is that?

104
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,384
That's why I call you blissfully ignorant!

105
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:22,843
That's why I call you blissfully ignorant!

106
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,637
The only beings who don't know of
the existence and value of gold...

107
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:28,348
...are the people living with it right under their noses.

108
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:28,598
...are the people living with it right under their noses.

109
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:29,224
...are the people living with it right under their noses.

110
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:30,100
Interestingly enough, we are now in the Final Game.

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,976
Interestingly enough, we are now in the Final Game.

112
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:31,601
Interestingly enough, we are now in the Final Game.

113
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:31,977
Interestingly enough, we are now in the Final Game.

114
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:32,894
Interestingly enough, we are now in the Final Game.

115
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,604
The one who is victorious in the Survival Game
shall claim the fortune of gold for their own.

116
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:35,105
The one who is victorious in the Survival Game
shall claim the fortune of gold for their own.

117
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:37,107
The one who is victorious in the Survival Game
shall claim the fortune of gold for their own.

118
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:39,109
The one who is victorious in the Survival Game
shall claim the fortune of gold for their own.

119
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:39,484
The one who is victorious in the Survival Game
shall claim the fortune of gold for their own.

120
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,030
Can you hear it?

121
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,783
The jubilant sound of our festival!

122
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:56,460
As a matter of fact, I am also a contestant in this event.

123
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,170
I must be going.

124
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,713
Wait, Enel!

125
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,841
The Enforcers! Will you release the Enforcers?

126
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:07,804
That is for only God to know.

127
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,682
WAIT, ENEL!

128
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,020
He disappeared...

129
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:19,983
Usopp!

130
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,110
Thank goodness! His heart's still beating!

131
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,362
Thank goodness! His heart's still beating!

132
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,162
GOMU GOMU NO...

133
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,262
FUUSEN!

134
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,820
Give it up!

135
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,241
No matter what you shoot me with,
whether it's cannons or rifles,

136
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:11,159
You won't even scratch me!

137
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,036
So it would seem.

138
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,830
Time to change the style.

139
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,727
What's this smell!?

140
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,608
This Breath Dial contains gas.

141
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,192
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

142
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:44,401
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

143
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:44,567
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

144
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:44,776
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

145
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:45,235
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

146
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:45,443
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

147
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:45,902
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

148
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:46,277
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

149
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:46,528
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

150
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:46,903
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

151
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:47,070
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

152
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,278
This weapon is known as the Burn Bazooka.

153
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:47,487
By igniting the released gas,

154
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,279
By igniting the released gas,

155
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:48,446
By igniting the released gas,

156
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:48,738
By igniting the released gas,

157
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:49,280
It fires a blue-white flame which
incinerates anything in its path.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,158
It fires a blue-white flame which
incinerates anything in its path.

159
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:52,867
It fires a blue-white flame which
incinerates anything in its path.

160
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,886
What is that thing!?

161
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,596
It burned right through that huge tree!

162
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:15,890
Huh?

163
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:17,726
He's gone!

164
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:18,893
Where'd that guy go?

165
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:20,562
Where'd that guy go?

166
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:34,862
GOMU GOMU NO...

167
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:37,662
PISTOL!

168
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,462
GOMU GOMU NO STAMP!

169
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,570
That was close!

170
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:10,987
That was close!

171
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:11,029
That was close!

172
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:14,462
GOMU GOMU NO...

173
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,862
YARI!

174
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,845
If you like bazookas...

175
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,014
Mine's bigger!

176
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,766
Straw Hat!

177
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,066
GOMU GOMU NO...

178
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:43,966
BURN!

179
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,366
BAZOOKA!!
BAZOOKA!!

180
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,880
Straw Hat!

181
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:26,104
Damn that guy!

182
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:56,175
What's wrong, Straw Hat!?

183
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,180
I know that wasn't enough to kill you!

184
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,144
Yeah!

185
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,646
Damn straight it wasn't!

186
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:39,677
What happened?

187
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:45,850
Where'd Straw Hat go?

188
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,311
Where'd Straw Hat go?

189
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,399
Whatever.

190
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:54,358
This isn't the time to be wasting my energy on him.

191
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:54,734
This isn't the time to be wasting my energy on him.

192
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,067
This isn't the time to be wasting my energy on him.

193
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,196
This isn't the time to be wasting my energy on him.

194
00:13:58,196 --> 00:13:59,530
More importantly...

195
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,159
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

196
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:03,326
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

197
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:03,993
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

198
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:04,160
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

199
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,494
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

200
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:05,328
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

201
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:05,620
I need to save enough strength to reach Enel.

202
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,748
If i use the Reject one more time,

203
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,542
My body will be reduced to ashes.

204
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,921
Just you wait...

205
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,021
Enel!

206
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:28,799
Had enough?

207
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:35,399
Damn. We can't let him go any farther!

208
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,651
Shut up!

209
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:38,528
I'm here for Enel's head!

210
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:39,153
You're in the way!

211
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:39,612
You're in the way!

212
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:39,862
You're in the way!

213
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:40,154
You're in the way!

214
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:40,446
You're in the way!

215
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:40,863
You're in the way!

216
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:49,247
Another one!?

217
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:55,002
These piece-of-shit Enforcers aren't worth my time!

218
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:57,630
These piece-of-shit Enforcers aren't worth my time!

219
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,888
What unusual cannonballs you have there.

220
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:10,226
Nothing that dense naturally exists in the sky.

221
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:13,854
Are they made of that Vearth mineral, iron?

222
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:19,151
You made quick work of my men.

223
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,736
You made quick work of my men.

224
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:20,903
You made quick work of my men.

225
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:24,407
You made quick work of my men.

226
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,575
I recognize you as one of Shandia's strongest warriors,

227
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:26,242
I recognize you as one of Shandia's strongest warriors,

228
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:26,701
I recognize you as one of Shandia's strongest warriors,

229
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:26,909
I recognize you as one of Shandia's strongest warriors,

230
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:27,702
I recognize you as one of Shandia's strongest warriors,

231
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,704
Genbou.

232
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:33,624
Chief Enforcer Yama!

233
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,042
Out of my way!

234
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,043
Out of my way!

235
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:36,836
Out of my way!

236
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,156
Damn you...

237
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:09,452
I'm not...

238
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:12,747
...dying like this!

239
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:13,247
...dying like this!

240
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,332
...dying like this!

241
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:14,790
...dying like this!

242
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,416
...dying like this!

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,628
Oh, still alive?

244
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:21,672
Tenacious, as I would expect.

245
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:22,965
very well.

246
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:26,385
To reward your strong resolve,

247
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:31,348
I shall finish you with my axe.

248
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,785
TEN-FOLD!

249
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:42,985
CURSE YOU, YAMA!!

250
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,785
AXE MOUNTAIN!

251
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,301
What a pity.

252
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,137
And After he came so far.

253
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:19,897
What!?

254
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,816
Who are you two!?

255
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,317
Don't ask stupid questions!

256
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:23,567
Don't ask stupid questions!

257
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:23,943
Don't ask stupid questions!

258
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:24,276
Don't ask stupid questions!

259
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:24,443
We're Enforcer clones!

260
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,569
We're Enforcer clones!

261
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,570
We're Enforcer clones!

262
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:26,821
How dare you hurt Satori, our big brother!

263
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:27,071
How dare you hurt Satori, our big brother!

264
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:27,321
How dare you hurt Satori, our big brother!

265
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:27,571
How dare you hurt Satori, our big brother!

266
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:28,072
How dare you hurt Satori, our big brother!

267
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:28,322
How dare you hurt Satori, our big brother!

268
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:28,697
How dare you hurt our big brother!

269
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:29,448
How dare you hurt our big brother!

270
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:29,949
How dare you hurt our big brother!

271
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:30,282
How dare you hurt our big brother!

272
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,795
What brother?

273
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:34,495
I don't know him!

274
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,351
Like hell you don't!

275
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,918
My name is Hotori!

276
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:41,126
My name is Hotori!

277
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:43,629
My name is Kotori!

278
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,466
And our third brother was taken out by you guys!

279
00:17:49,426 --> 00:17:52,638
Like I said, I don't know him!

280
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:57,059
Satori was one of the four Priests who serve Enel.

281
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,648
His domain was the Lost Forest.

282
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,569
So, he's the Priest who Luffy and the guys beat?

283
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,238
Yes, the older brother of these two.

284
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:09,738
Well, look at that!

285
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:10,990
Well, look at that!

286
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,950
You really do know!

287
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:13,576
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

288
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,034
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

289
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:14,451
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

290
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:14,660
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

291
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:14,827
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

292
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:15,160
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

293
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,327
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

294
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:15,536
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

295
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:15,786
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

296
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:15,911
WE'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS!

297
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,955
PIERRE!

298
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:25,713
We must deal with these two quickly and pursue Enel!

299
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:26,672
We must deal with these two quickly and pursue Enel!

300
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,884
If we do not, he may harm my former subordinates!

301
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,522
Stand back, my dear!

302
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,401
Even with my injuries, I will not lose to the likes of them!

303
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,360
No!

304
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,695
Sometimes, it's me...

305
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:52,406
...who has to protect them!

306
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,742
...who has to protect them!

307
00:18:58,245 --> 00:18:59,788
very well.

308
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,042
First, we must determine what Dials they possess.

309
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:03,876
Alright.

310
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,254
Let's avenge our brother!

311
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,774
finally stopped.

312
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,212
Where am I?

313
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:03,727
Oiii!

314
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:04,978
Guys?

315
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,772
You here?

316
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,272
It's me!

317
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:08,941
If you're here, answer me!

318
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,818
If you're here, answer me!

319
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:12,903
Guess they're not here...

320
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,738
Guess they're not here...

321
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,115
WHERE!?

322
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,699
WHERE!?

323
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,704
Where did it go?!

324
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,249
G-Gedatsu sama...

325
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,876
Y-Your eyes are rolled all the way back.

326
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:31,114
You cannot see in front of yourself like that.

327
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,214
How careless!

328
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,509
Please look at this photograph.

329
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:37,761
Right here.

330
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:39,304
That furry little guy.

331
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:42,307
He is one of the BIue Sea dwellers!

332
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,725
What?

333
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,061
He isn't a tanuki?

334
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,646
A tanuki?

335
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,648
No, he is no wild animal.

336
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,986
There can be no doubt that this creature came from the Blue Sea.

337
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,029
Luffy!

338
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,490
Where are you?

339
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,117
Zoro!

340
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,578
Are you still asleep?

341
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,121
Robin!

342
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:06,790
Come quick!

343
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,294
Isn't anyone here!?

344
00:21:10,294 --> 00:21:12,880
Isn't this were we're supposed to meet!?

345
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,549
Oi, guys!

346
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,249
It's me!

347
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,852
Where is it?

348
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,492
Where'd it go!?

349
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,992
SCARY!

350
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,792
W-What's going on!?

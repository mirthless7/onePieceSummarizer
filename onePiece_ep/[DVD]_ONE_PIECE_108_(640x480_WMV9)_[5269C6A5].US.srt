1
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:58,150
Alarming Bananawani

2
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:58,150
and Mr. Prince

3
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,490
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,210
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,080
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,900
Nanohana

7
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,040
An impostor presented himself in front of the people while claiming to be Cobra.

8
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,150
He informed them that the shortage of rain was its work.

9
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,100
And then it started to destroy the village…

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,550
… and to persecute its inhabitants.

11
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,690
According to the tortuous intentions of the trap of Crocodile, the hatred of the people exploded.

12
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,210
The flames of a violent rebellion seized all the country of Arabasta.

13
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,460
The rebellious army is now solved for its final and decisive battle with Alubarna.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
But Luffy and its crew…
are always imprisoned in Rainbase.

15
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,220
The army rebels approaches while we speak!

16
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,540
Listen attentively!

17
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,400
We will sacrifice our lives to protect Arabasta!

18
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,820
Do not fear death!

19
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,820
You give to bottom!

20
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,310
We will attack the rebellious army!

21
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,990
Prepare you to intercept them!

22
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,120
Let us reverse Alubarna!

23
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,000
Does Ca go, Kohza?

24
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,730
This wound is not serious!

25
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,370
With this pace, we will reach Alubarna with the lever du soleil!

26
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,540
We will maintain this pace during all the way!

27
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,530
Included/understood!

28
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,400
The battle…

29
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,980
...com will mencera at dawn!

30
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,100
What a coincidence!

31
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,820
We were also going to leave in Alubarna.

32
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,010
If you want to accompany us, you are the welcome.

33
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,140
Or…

34
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,440
… will you save them in the place?

35
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,740
It is…!

36
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,840
The key of the cage!

37
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,460
Give the-me!

38
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,560
This key!

39
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,700
A trap door!

40
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,570
I cannot say that how long will take before they start with entretuer.

41
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,610
Even while travelling as quickly as possible until Alubarna, you will be able nothing to probably make.

42
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,810
If you want to stop the rebellion, I advise you to leave immediately, Miss Wednesday.

43
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,000
Or will you save them in the place?

44
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,910
Unfortunately, I accidentally made fall the key in the part in lower part…

45
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,510
Banana Croco

46
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,510
Bananawani Den.

47
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,170
Bananawani…!

48
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,020
Bananawani?

49
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,120
What is it?

50
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,120
There is a crocodile under a banana!

51
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,080
It is what these monstrous crocos?!

52
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,720
Would that like to say that… this part is under water!?

53
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,400
Mysterious bananas…

54
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,350
Moron, looks at well!

55
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,560
The bananas are not under the crocodiles.

56
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,910
They are strange crocodiles.

57
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,390
Is He, what there, Vivi?

58
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,420
One of the bananawanis swallowed the key!

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,300
What!?

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,910
Goes to its continuation and make spit to him!

61
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,560
I am unable!

62
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,820
Bananawani is a wild creature, they are predatory sailors.

63
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,250
He will eat me at the second when I will approach it!

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
I am afflicted, I held the key so awkwardly.

65
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,210
And moreover, I do not believe that you will be able to say which swallowed.

66
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,230
What!?

67
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,810
What a idiot!

68
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,800
Shit, if one could open the cage,
I would deal with these monstrous reptiles.

69
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,330
Be to you an idiot, Zoro.

70
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,850
We cannot leave because it swallowed the key.

71
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,100
I know it!

72
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,200
Well.

73
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,490
The hour had just left.

74
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,040
Still a thing, this part car-will be destroyed in one hour exactly.

75
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,880
This secret base that I used to direct Baroque Works me is not any more any utility.

76
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,280
Water will fill this part and will run it until the bottom of the Lake Rainbase.

77
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,430
A million innocent people?

78
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,200
Or four pirate poor wretches who don't have any future in front of them?

79
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,520
One or the other.

80
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,440
The chances of all to save them are tiny.

81
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,260
It is with you to see, Miss Wednesday.

82
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,110
You like the bets?

83
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,460
There are so much idiots in this country which my plan was too easy.

84
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,420
Especially these young bold rebels and this old man who digs holes with Yuba.

85
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,060
Q- What did you say!?

86
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,700
You want to speak about the grandpa!?

87
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,480
He tries to dig an oasis died, day after day, with this desperate face.

88
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,150
Which old stupid man.

89
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,700
With time, the tempêtes de sable came and he refused to give up.

90
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,260
You…

91
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,990
Say to me, Luffy with the straw hat,

92
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,920
you believe that tempêtes de sable…

93
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,240
… always fall down on the same village by chance?

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,630
What does that want to say?

95
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,380
Yuba…

96
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,780
… cannot be made overcome by simple sand.

97
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,870
I will ressusciterai it.

98
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,530
It does not matter time that will take to me…

99
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,610
It does not matter time that will take to me…

100
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,160
You…

101
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,580
… ace does that!?

102
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,660
Vivi-Chan.

103
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,780
I believe the King.

104
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,170
It is not the kind of anybody to betray his country.

105
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,000
I will kill you.

106
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,940
He! water starts to invade the part!

107
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,110
This rate/rhythm, the part will be entirely immersed!

108
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,800
Vivi! Helps us! Do something!

109
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,290
I do not want that it is my last hour!

110
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,680
Calm yourself idiotic.

111
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,720
Zoro! Be to you a cretin! Water goes up!

112
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,490
How I can calm myself at one similar time!?

113
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,880
If we do not reflect, we all will die!

114
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,360
You do not include/understand!?

115
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,430
My country or my companions…!?

116
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,110
In any case, you no, isn't this will let to me have some?

117
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,770
You will have killed me before even as I reach Alubarna.

118
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,610
I know…

119
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,170
… how nothing will stop as much as I will not have killed you!

120
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,860
You do not know anything…

121
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,880
… in connection with the inhabitants of this country…

122
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,600
… nor of their history…

123
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,820
… nor their lives…

124
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,160
You do not know anything the whole…!

125
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,120
Vivi!

126
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,270
Do something!

127
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,090
Make leave to us from there!

128
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,600
Luffy-San…

129
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,470
Do Ah, then you have fear of dying, Luffy with the straw hat?

130
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,880
It is true…

131
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,880
I suppose that everyone fears death.

132
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,340
If us…

133
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,840
If we die here…

134
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,430
who will explode to him the mouth?!

135
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,940
Would not be pretentious, kid.

136
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,960
It is you here the kid.

137
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,440
If you give up them, it would be time, Miss Wednesday.

138
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,140
You want to stop the rebellion above all.

139
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,920
It is imposing…

140
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,920
Yosh!

141
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,450
Burst it, Vivi!

142
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,640
Would not be ridiculous!

143
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,830
It is well too large!

144
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,520
Vivi!

145
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,100
Flee!

146
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,890
You cannot fight against that!

147
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,650
But…

148
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,720
Save us!

149
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,410
It is you which are ridiculous!

150
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,330
One moment, look at!

151
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,300
Behind the window!

152
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,590
They make all the tail to go to eat!

153
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,990
They think that we are their meal.

154
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,400
In one hour, we all will be in their bellies!

155
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,790
Whore! Too much fast!

156
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,870
It crunched the staircase of only one blow!

157
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,660
What jaws!

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,970
Vivi!!

159
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,670
Shit! This monster is unbeatable!

160
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,180
Vivi!

161
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,420
Flee!!

162
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,950
Be raised!

163
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,820
Vivi, it will devour you!

164
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,810
A message.

165
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,320
What is it?

166
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,750
Hello?

167
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,180
Hello?

168
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,570
Does this trick function?

169
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,830
Yes, I hear you.

170
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,150
You of the Million, isn't this is one?

171
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,820
Does He, that go?

172
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,630
Baby Den Den Mushi = Snail Phon of pocket

173
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,630
I had never used one of these Babies Den Den Mushi before…

174
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,060
Yes, that functions.

175
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,490
Continue to speak inside.

176
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,770
What is there?

177
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,940
Go ahead spits.
What did it occur?

178
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,030
Ah, I already heard this front voice.

179
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,930
He, thank you for the call.

180
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,930
Here the Restaurant of Shit.

181
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,020
He, thank you for the call.

182
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,410
Here the Restaurant of Shit.

183
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,030
The Restaurant of Shit, you known as?

184
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,240
Hein?

185
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,750
It would be said that you remember.

186
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,410
I am flattered.

187
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,660
He, thank you for the call.

188
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,090
Here the Restaurant of Shit.

189
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,540
You want to place order?

190
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,200
Stop talking cock, jerk!

191
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,630
Den Den Mushi?

192
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,990
What do you want to say?

193
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,550
I did not make use of Den Den Mushi when I was on Little Garden…

194
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,390
The four pirates of Straw hat are locked up in this cage.

195
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,550
The only one which remainder must be their pet.

196
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,320
Is there another of them?

197
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
Did He, you hear!?

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,570
The Restaurant of Shit.
Ca must be…

199
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,340
San…

200
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,370
Wait, Luffy!

201
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,370
They do not know it yet!

202
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,530
This day when Mr.2 was on board.

203
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,470
He did not see it because he was in the kitchen.

204
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,200
Sanji-San…

205
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,150
It is true!

206
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,690
Sanji-San and Tony-Kun are always outside!

207
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,750
Who are you, poor shit?

208
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,180
Me?

209
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,760
I am…

210
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,970
Mr. Prince.

211
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,220
I see, Mr. Prince.

212
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,960
Where are you?

213
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,360
I cannot say it for the moment.

214
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,300
If I said it to you, you would come to kill me.

215
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,840
Even if I do not think that you can reach that point.

216
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,130
I am not also stupid to give information.

217
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,080
Not like you, Mr. 0.

218
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,440
Prince-San!

219
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,180
The Help!!

220
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,840
One does not have any more as a a long time!

221
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,760
Save me too!

222
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,890
Prince-San! Make leave to us from here!

223
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,480
One is in the soup!

224
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,350
It would be said that my crew is not far from you.

225
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,440
Well, I suppose that I…

226
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,620
The dumb…

227
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,160
Hello?

228
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,330
One had it.

229
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,130
What do we have to make of this type?

230
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,270
Sanji-San…

231
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,890
Not…!

232
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,890
Where are you?

233
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,110
Give your position!

234
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,410
We are in Rainbase in front of the doors of the casino Rain Dinners.

235
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,380
This good with nothing got caught!

236
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,700
It may find it beneficial to be still in life!

237
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,810
Sanji!

238
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,490
Our last hope…

239
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,580
All is perfect.

240
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,600
Let us go to the door.

241
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,590
You are sure?

242
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,750
The Million is unaware of still the identity of their chief.

243
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,250
I do not go there as a chief.

244
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,060
Nobody knows our identity with share the Numbers Agents.

245
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,380
But as a Crocodile the owner of the casino,

246
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,460
nothing prevents me from going to see what occurs.

247
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,860
What is there the curious one with that?

248
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,650
Vivi!

249
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,060
What do you make?

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,670
Vivi!

251
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,940
There remains still time before this part is not flooded!

252
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,940
I leave to seek of the assistance!

253
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,380
Ouais, Sanji cannot be dead!

254
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,420
If Vivi can release it in one way or another…

255
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,930
And Chopper is him outside too!

256
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,160
Ca should go…

257
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,620
Attention, Vivi!

258
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,120
Vivi!

259
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,460
Do not test anything stupid.

260
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,770
Ahhh! Vivi, begin again yourself!

261
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,320
Vivi, awakes!

262
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,460
Make leave to us!

263
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,070
Vivi, saves us!

264
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,590
Vivi!

265
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,560
If you hold so much with your friends, you have to only die with them.

266
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,540
As soon as water fills the salle à manger of the crocodiles, this part will start to run.

267
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,370
I think that I will bring back this impudent of Mr. Prince at the same time for you…

268
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,220
At least its corpse!

269
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,420
Make shit!

270
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,530
Oh, Main Crocodile.

271
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,920
You are with the current in connection with Nanohana?

272
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,580
Hm? Ah yes, I know.

273
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,820
The rebellious army and the royal army are about to clash!

274
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,120
The whole city east…

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,270
Not, the whole country is without top-below!

276
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,540
Yes, eh well…

277
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,750
The King is the kind of anybody who does not raise the little finger when the villages are attacked by the pirates.

278
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,060
That does not surprise me at all.

279
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,580
He look at, it is Crocodile-San!

280
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,670
It is him! What a class!

281
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,310
It is really him!

282
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,310
It is never shown in the casino!

283
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,530
Crocodile-Sama!

284
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,600
Which popularity.

285
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,490
Oh, does not look at me like that.

286
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,290
Monster, when did you touch my face?

287
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,190
I did not touch it, I struck it!

288
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,010
You forgot, my large wolf?

289
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:29,920
What?

290
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,960
You want to fight?

291
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,030
Stop that. There are others of them to fight.

292
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,500
They is tedious.

293
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,840
Why do I have to make a so tedious mission with these so tedious people?

294
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,900
One card-indexes oneself if they is pleasant or tedious…

295
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,170
We are with range of sight of Alubarna.

296
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,980
Oh yes!

297
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Show to me! Show to me!

298
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,440
Really?

299
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,440
Thus it is Alubarna…

300
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,710
Over there, the curtain will open on our play.

301
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,420
The ambitions of Zero-Chan will flower like a flower of the desert.

302
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,170
Vivi!

303
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,940
Until now,

304
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,120
they always protected me and always took care on me.

305
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,670
I cannot give up them and let them die!

306
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:22,840
It succeeded!

307
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,870
She east flees!

308
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,280
The panes yielded and water goes up more quickly!

309
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,060
This train, the part will run in less than 20 minutes!

310
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,340
This part is foutue!

311
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,860
Vivi!

312
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,830
Does Ca go!?

313
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,530
You all!

314
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,900
Hold good still a small moment!

315
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,260
I will seek of the assistance!

316
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,350
It is out of the question that I let to you die!

317
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,110
Well!

318
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,870
Go ahead, Vivi!

319
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,860
That devil…

320
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,630
… did it occur here?

321
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,610
In addition to the losses caused by Pell the falcon…

322
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,040
all the Million this city was crushed.

323
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,490
What did it occur here?

324
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,360
He!

325
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,240
The man who is made call “Mr. Prince”.

326
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,140
Didn't you say me that you had caught it?

327
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,760
Where is party?

328
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,250
It has just left towards the South…

329
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,220
At the moment?

330
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,230
It is him.

331
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,760
Poor insane…

332
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,650
He believes capacity to escape to me…

333
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,770
Why not let it slip by?

334
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,710
Close it!

335
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,920
I killed all the people…

336
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,740
… which had enough notch to resist to me!

337
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,450
He, that does occur?
An earthquake?

338
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,870
Oh not!

339
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,330
The bridge of Rain Dinners crumbled!

340
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,650
How did it can crumble so quickly!?

341
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,780
What does that want to say?

342
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,230
What caused that!?

343
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,480
How did that can arrive!?

344
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,640
We cannot turn over downtown any more!

345
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,590
There is no boat!?

346
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,560
How did that can arrive!?

347
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,950
The bridge… crumbled…

348
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,430
Oh not… I cannot leave any more from here now!

349
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,490
It is not that we cannot leave any more…

350
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,020
But the fact that Baroque Works doesnot can return any more here.

351
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,470
All occurs as envisaged.

352
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,330
Chopper is being used as soft food and makes it tower of the city.

353
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,840
We would make better press us, the rebellion started.

354
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,390
Sanji-San!

355
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,080
Say to me only where to go…

356
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,730
Princess.

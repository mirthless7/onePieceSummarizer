1
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:25,130
The first obstacle?

2
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:25,130
The giant whale Laboon appears

3
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,980
He! I can see Reverse Montain!

4
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,840
What?

5
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,720
One cannot even see the top through the clouds!

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,030
Here thus Red Line!

7
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,200
It is incredible…

8
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,490
Water really climbs on the mountain!

9
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,470
One succeeded!

10
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,470
Towards the top!

11
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,330
We reach the sky!

12
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,820
Now we will go down!

13
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,590
The largest ocean of the world…

14
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,460
Large Line!

15
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,680
It is really immense!

16
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,060
You have not just heard a trick?

17
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
Hein? What?

18
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,150
I heard a strange sound!

19
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,200
That must be the wind!

20
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,080
There are many odd rock formations which can cause that.

21
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,560
What is it?

22
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,980
Nami-San!

23
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,710
I see a mountain right in front of us!

24
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,060
A mountain? It is impossible!

25
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,690
But I see it in front of us!

26
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,470
One of fout!

27
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,600
One goes there!

28
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,680
After the twin points, there should be only the ocean!

29
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,980
It is not a mountain!

30
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,390
It is a black wall!

31
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,420
You are mistaken!

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,510
Then it is what?

33
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
It is a whale!!!

34
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,120
Qu… Qu… What does one make?

35
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,900
One fights?

36
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,130
Cretin! One cannot fight with such a thing!

37
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,810
… … The current sends to us on it!

38
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,650
What will one make?

39
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,720
Wait one minute!

40
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,160
The more one approaches, the more that resembles a wall!

41
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,600
Then, where is its eye?

42
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,850
I see!

43
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,700
It did not should yet have noticed us!

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,570
If that continues, one will be crushed dead tops…

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,350
He! There is an opening on the left!

46
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,260
A port!

47
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,050
Right towards the port!

48
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
The rudder is broken!

49
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,100
Is necessary to do something!

50
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,410
I will help!

51
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,850
Ah! Here!

52
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,680
I have just had an good idea!

53
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,710
Luffy?

54
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,590
What do you make?

55
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,760
Tireeezz!!

56
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,150
That will not turn!

57
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,440
It is not worthwhile!

58
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,300
Do not give up!

59
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,010
Too much late.

60
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,490
The gun???

61
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,430
One stopped?

62
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,870
Oh… shit…

63
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,620
That failed to kill me.

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
My special seat!!

65
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,480
Flee

66
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,460
while you can it!

67
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,700
What does it occur?

68
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,300
She did not notice that she was caught a boulet de canon!

69
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,750
She is stupid or what?

70
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,320
One of fout! One goes there!

71
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,580
Aahh! My ears!

72
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,100
Rows! Continue to row!

73
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,430
Il faut qu'on s'éloigne d'elle !

74
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,740
Luffy?

75
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,250
You…

76
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,130
My favorite seat…

77
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,530
Why you broke it brothel?

78
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,340
Cretin!!!!

79
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,630
She saw us!

80
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,340
You ace considering that?

81
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,260
I go you botter the bottom!!!

82
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,950
The farm, ball!!

83
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,590
What…

84
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,400
Luffy!

85
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,380
Luffy!

86
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,410
I must move!

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,730
I will not die here!

88
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,160
What did I make?

89
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,540
The others were eaten.

90
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:43,800
He!

91
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,940
He! Dirtiness!

92
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,880
Recrache others!

93
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,560
Recrache them!

94
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,750
Return them! Return them!

95
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,940
Salts it to you…

96
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,010
Bastard!

97
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,500
You plunge?

98
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,210
Stop!

99
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:55,670
He!

100
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,070
Stop!

101
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,760
He!!

102
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,380
Wait a little!

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,870
Return to me my companions!

104
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,530
He!

105
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,440
I said stop!

106
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,180
We must live venture together!

107
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,710
They are invaluable for me!

108
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,270
Return them!!

109
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,830
What you of known as?

110
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,370
“What I think” you say?

111
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,150
One of fout of what you think!

112
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,640
We were swallowed in an obvious way by a whale.

113
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,120
Is this a dream?

114
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:47,940
Yes.

115
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Surely a dream.

116
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,760
And thus the house on this island…

117
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,490
An illusion.

118
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,730
Ah… and that?

119
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,510
A giant squid!!

120
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,970
It would be said that there is somebody in the house.

121
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,090
I hope that it is a person…

122
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,090
Enough! I want to return to the house.

123
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,710
If Luffy were there, it would know what to make…

124
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,390
Ah yes! Is Luffy well?

125
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,160
It is what all that?

126
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,310
Why this whale has a door

127
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,310
and maintaining a corridor?

128
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,210
A boat?

129
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,220
Kill it!

130
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,590
Disintegrate the island with the gun!

131
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,530
Not, wait one moment.

132
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,320
Somebody leaves.

133
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,160
It is a flower!

134
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,840
A flower?

135
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,620
As much for me! It is a person!

136
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,790
It is which this type?

137
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,270
This old man killed the giant squid.

138
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,900
Did it fish

139
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,930
or did he want to save us?

140
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,910
Say something, dumb!

141
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,700
One will fight with you if it is what you want, dumb!

142
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,540
We have a gun!

143
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,190
Stop, or somebody will die.

144
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,200
And would that be which?

145
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,300
Me.

146
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,600
You?

147
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,490
Whore of…

148
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,720
He, does not irritate you.

149
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,560
To play with me like that…

150
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,840
Grandfather, say to me…

151
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,480
Where are we?

152
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,150
And which are you?

153
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,630
If you want something of somebody,

154
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,680
it is more polished to present to you initially!

155
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,020
Yes! It is true.

156
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,080
As much for me.

157
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,100
I am called Rorono…

158
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,910
I am Crocus.

159
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,980
I am the guard of the headlight of the twin points.

160
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,200
I am 71 years old.

161
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,060
Gemini, blood group AB.

162
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,560
Can I kill it now?

163
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,730
He, of the calm one!

164
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,720
You want to know where you are?

165
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,900
You are in my particular island.

166
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,030
You shout of the insults in my connection.

167
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,450
You believe that you are in the stomach of a rat?

168
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,490
Therefore, we were really swallowed by the whale!

169
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,790
But, that does not resemble inside a whale…

170
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,040
Wait a little!

171
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,590
What will it arrive to us?

172
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,020
I do not want to be digested!

173
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
Stop doing that!!

174
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,630
You donot can appreciate a good gag of repetition?

175
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,650
A gag?

176
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,480
For the exit, it is over there!

177
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,880
One can leave?

178
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,910
Wait one second!

179
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,310
Why there is an exit in the stomach of a whale?

180
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,120
And what makes this door in the sky?

181
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,880
Wait…

182
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,620
Look at attentively.

183
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,660
Sky, clouds…

184
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,560
And even the gull…

185
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,460
That was painted!!

186
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,990
All is painted in the stomach of the whale!

187
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,400
I like to have fun!

188
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,360
Whore, what you made there?

189
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,000
They is good, leaves it quiet.

190
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:43,890
Now, one does what?

191
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,720
Nami, there is an exit.

192
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,520
Then let us leave from here.

193
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,580
Ouais it is clear.

194
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,370
What?

195
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,730
It starts again.

196
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,440
Look at that!

197
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,890
It is not an island!

198
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,640
It is a boat,

199
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,100
and it is made of metal!

200
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,810
It is true!

201
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,570
That means that this “ocean” must be made of gastric acid!

202
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,890
If we remain too a long time here,
we will be digested…

203
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,340
He!

204
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,680
It starts again what?

205
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
You explain!

206
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,780
This whale…

207
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,480
Laboon started again to be thrown against Red Line.

208
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,900
What?

209
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,910
I remember,

210
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,680
this whale had enormous scars on the head,

211
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,890
and it looked at the sky.

212
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,500
What do you say?

213
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,010
She suffers!

214
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,480
I see!

215
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,480
Then, the plan of the old man was…

216
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,150
Probably.

217
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,130
It tries to kill the whale of the interior!

218
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,320
Eh well…

219
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,550
What a way of killing horrible!

220
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,840
Let us leave from here now that we cleared up the mystery.

221
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,450
Our boat will be digested there if you remain to feel sorry for you.

222
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,800
Well, the businesses of whale are not my onions.

223
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,480
And I do not see myself saving that one.

224
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,090
Let us leave from here!

225
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,810
Shit!

226
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,120
The waves are too large!

227
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,090
One will not be able to arrive at the exit like that!

228
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,520
One will try to row.
Take the oars!

229
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
We must leave now!

230
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,560
We must see what arrived at Luffy!

231
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,540
It is outside!

232
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,840
I saw it being ejected mouth of the whale!

233
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,120
The old man plunged!

234
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,070
Hein?

235
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,890
Why does it do that?
It will be digested!

236
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,060
Why?

237
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,010
To turn, turn, my eyes turn!

238
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,140
I am where now?

239
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,110
An ocean?

240
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,010
A river?

241
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:23,870
A pipe?

242
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,990
Well.

243
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,570
Our infiltration is a real success.

244
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,990
Now, Wednesday Miss.

245
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,510
Other side of this door, it there with the stomach

246
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,700
and this old curious croûton also.

247
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,650
It must be eliminated

248
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,790
for the good of this whale.

249
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,210
Yes, Mr. 9!

250
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:59,970
This whale is the most invaluable good of our city.

251
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,880
He! the old man remakes surface!

252
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,650
Be unaware of it!

253
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,010
We must find how to open this door.

254
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,900
Ok, Wednesday Miss?

255
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,940
“3, 2,1, Baby” and we open the door.

256
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,740
Do not hesitate.

257
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,410
Roger, Mr. 9!

258
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,590
When you want.

259
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,790
I cannot stop!

260
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,170
Which is this voice, Mr. 9?

261
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,050
I do not know Miss Wednesday!

262
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,950
Still them!

263
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,270
Oh not, Wednesday Miss!

264
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,700
In lower part, there is an immense ocean of gastric juices!

265
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,250
Luffy?

266
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,400
Yo! You are well?

267
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,860
While passing…

268
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,530
Help me please!

269
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,390
Luffy joined us…

270
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,640
But it brought with him two odd people.

271
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,840
He! The old man left!

272
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,290
One of fout.

273
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,350
It is necessary to save Luffy.

274
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,270
Stop Laboon.

275
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,010
Stop making you these terrible scars.

276
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,420
There remains an only little sedative.

277
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,360
It will be necessary that I remake some later.

278
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,740
This wall is the wall which separates the oceans from the world.

279
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,800
It will not break even if you slaps stronger, Laboon.

280
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,980
That is calmed!

281
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,950
The whale calmed itself!

282
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,490
One would say…

283
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,430
Thus…

284
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,400
We saved your buttocks.

285
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,960
Now which are you?

286
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,750
Mr. 9, they are pirates.

287
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,160
I see it, Miss Wednesday.

288
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,810
But I think that one can convince them…

289
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,970
Probably.

290
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,760
You are still there, both scélérats?

291
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,810
Made me not repeat!

292
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,160
As long as I will be in life,

293
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,910
you will not pose a finger on Laboon!

294
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,630
Oh, the revoilà.

295
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,230
Who is this old man?

296
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,090
Tell what you want,
we will not give up.

297
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,080
To kill this whale is our mission.

298
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,000
We will not let to you interfere with our whale once more!

299
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,890
We will make a hole in its stomach!

300
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,100
Allons-y, Baby!

301
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,530
Roger!

302
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,500
Bandage…

303
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,010
The old man stopped the balls itself!

304
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,810
Incredible!
He thus protects the whale?

305
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,880
Stop your pathetic resistance!

306
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,040
If you want to protect it so much,
you will have to remake it!

307
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,810
The whale will nourish our city!

308
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,890
What does it occur?

309
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,850
Luffy?

310
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,580
I do not know.

311
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,080
I was to strike them.

312
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,620
You helped me much.

313
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,820
But why?

314
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,320
I did not help you.

315
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,620
I did not want to see that, it is all.

316
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,380
He, which is these people?

317
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,410
And what you made inside the whale?

318
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,840
These two scélérats are of a city not very far.

319
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,470
They want the meat of the whale.

320
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:07,580
Laboon could nourish their city during two or three years.

321
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,250
Laboon?

322
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,960
It is the name of this whale.

323
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,750
It is a whale of the islands.

324
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,500
It is in West Blue that saw

325
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,250
the greatest species of whale of the world.

326
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,140
How could I let it become food?

327
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,150
There is a reason for which it continues to strike its cranium against Red Line

328
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,040
and why it deals with Reverse Montain and its sky.

329
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,000
A reason?

330
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,340
Yes.

331
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,290
This whale…

332
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,800
This whale has a heart like a person.

333
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,570
And it indefinitely awaits a certain group of pirates.

334
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,430
Since 50 years…

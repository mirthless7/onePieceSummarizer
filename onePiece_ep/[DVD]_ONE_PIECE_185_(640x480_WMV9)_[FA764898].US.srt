1
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,140
The plan of Eneru God
come to a end.

2
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,800
Luffy comes to defy Eneru,

3
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,650
but it falls from the Arch.

4
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,870
What is there? You managed
to survive all this time.

5
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,499
Forget these lower imbeciles.

6
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,870
There is a future which you wish, not?

7
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,950
A future which I do wish?

8
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,810
Yes, I have one of them.

9
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,630
But, if I were to leave
with you, I would be alone.

10
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,300
The truth, it is that there is a multitude
of thing which I want to make or to have.

11
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,970
But if I must give up these people
and outward journey with you to have them…

12
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,770
Then I do not want anything!

13
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,149
I of insane who you would be a god.

14
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,140
If you installations would not be this
that a finger on Nami-san,

15
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,450
I would become it
Demon of the Blue Sea!

16
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,120
NAMI-SWAAAN!

17
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,770
mezameta futari

18
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,770
Two Reveillees People!

19
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,770
The Face of the Love Ignites!!

20
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,770
moeru koi No kyuushyutsuzen SEN

21
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:43,260
If you do not wish to remain on board this vessel, then you have only one possible destination.

22
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,380
It is a forthcoming life.

23
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,020
It is impossible for
me to overcome this type.

24
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,269
However, I do not want
not to remain on this boat!

25
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,680
My heart…

26
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,480
no regret has.

27
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:07,870
Well, following that, you include/understand well that you will not be able to leave this healthy and safe arch.

28
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:15,820
Or then, you by chance would count on
two mice which was introduced on board?

29
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,349
I… I want to go down!

30
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,600
To this pace, one will go so high
that one will not be able to go down any more, Sanji!

31
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,810
Moreover, God must
to find on this arch.

32
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,899
One already started to climb
the arch! It is necessary to go until the end!

33
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,820
But how
you will be caught there, Sanji?!

34
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,900
This boat is so large that it could
to have well there hundreds of enemies on board!

35
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,859
One will not be able to even unload.

36
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,240
It is not all. One does what
if God and the Priests are there?

37
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,699
He, you ace jitter or what?!

38
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,570
However, you ace of the effective tools.

39
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,789
You can fight well not?!

40
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,800
It is not for that
I invented them!

41
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,960
At all events, now we know
that our enemy uses his Mantra.

42
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,290
It is not the sorrow to move back.

43
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,390
One already had to be made locate
by the enemy since one moment.

44
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,680
They know that one is there?
How one makes now?

45
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,300
Useless to worry some!

46
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,190
When one is inside, one
separate and one goes on the bridge.

47
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,109
Nami-san
find over there!

48
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,020
Q-what? Good Ah, one separates?!

49
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,439
Be insane for you?!

50
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,610
One does not even know how much
they are in it!

51
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,780
They is too dangerous, two people alone will not be enough to overcome them, then why…

52
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,310
Imbecile!

53
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,870
If one does not separate, one
will be beaten both.

54
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,330
How that? You say that to
less will one of us die?

55
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,080
One minute… by chance waits…

56
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,960
do not only say to me…
it is to save Nami.

57
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,139
Listen to me, Usopp.

58
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,850
If is to save Nami-san,
it is not serious if you sacrifice yourself.

59
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,679
I WILL KILL YOU, DUMB!

60
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,200
Go, one goes there!
Await to me Nami-san!

61
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,460
Our discussion was not finished!

62
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,399
Nami-swan!

63
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,189
He wait! Await me, Sanji! He!

64
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,810
Wait! Sanji-kun!

65
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,660
It would be said that they are beautiful
and come well to save you.

66
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,860
They are really ridiculous.

67
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,620
Who thus? With Luffy share,
nobody is in a position to move.

68
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,950
Moreover, how they are
gone up on board boat?

69
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,890
Even if the helps arrive,
nobody will be saved.

70
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,800
And then, I do not have
need to await them.

71
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,480
I must count on the chance… I
can only jump out of the boat.

72
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,530
If not, I am sure
to 100% to die here.

73
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,409
I face the lightning…

74
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,320
There is a means
to overcome it?

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,700
What is it that?

76
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,680
In fact the machines do all.

77
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,940
Not need for machinists
or of hommes de main, hein?

78
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,020
, That I do not like shit.

79
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,079
There is nobody here!

80
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,789
But in a so large boat…

81
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,650
why machines
function of themselves?

82
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,599
How this boat can fly away?

83
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,419
I had never seen that!

84
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,250
The simple fact of going up
on this boat frightens me.

85
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,619
It is strange!

86
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,130
What can feed it well?

87
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,790
There is a risk
what does the boat fall?

88
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:45,850
Moreover, even if one finds Nami on
bridge, one will not be able to be left there afterwards.

89
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,540
How one is
to make, brothel?

90
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,610
Sky…

91
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,410
darkens more and more.

92
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,120
It for soon
to begin the destruction.

93
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,910
And unfortunately…

94
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,340
the Gold Bell must be
just above us.

95
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,600
Assemble all on the boats
! Do not remain here!

96
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,320
Quickly on the White Sea! It
does not have there time to lose!

97
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,850
What a sinister boat!

98
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,450
It is really the end of this country!

99
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,860
To evacuate the village? But Chief…

100
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,569
What are warriors made?

101
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,110
They are not yet
incomes Upper-Yard!

102
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,690
Useless to await them.

103
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,199
Why that?

104
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,610
What do you say?

105
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,329
The warriors are not any more of the children.

106
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,240
They can only manage.

107
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,200
Believe in them.

108
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,540
Eneru will make disappear this country.

109
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,330
Ca is not any doubt.

110
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,719
Just like it destroyed
its native land, Bilka.

111
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,470
It tries to destroy
this one also.

112
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,050
Go, will run to your boats!

113
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,980
Our priority is to save
life of the villagers here present!

114
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,310
Any thing has an end.

115
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,610
Wiper, that is enough.

116
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,490
You made any possible tone!

117
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,539
You come from the Blue Sea?

118
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,129
Ouais, one comes from in bottom.

119
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,450
You live here?

120
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,220
All occurs in
the forest in front of me…

121
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,290
But I cannot see it.

122
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,630
I can only wait.

123
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,420
You all…

124
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,090
Return healthy and safe!

125
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,650
Bird-horse-chan
!

126
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,199
Bird-horse-chan
!

127
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,370
Afflicted! You protected me!

128
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,150
Aisa?

129
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,079
Aisa!

130
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,030
AISA!

131
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,999
Luffy?

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,410
You are alive?

133
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,049
Where are you?

134
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,149
By here!

135
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,669
Here!

136
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,410
Aisa!

137
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,339
Aisa!!

138
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,139
He!

139
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,809
I helps!

140
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,509
Here! Here! Here!

141
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,840
How you made ace
to fall like that?!

142
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,019
Good!

143
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,190
Shit! I do not arrive at
to remove this gold testicle!

144
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,190
[Note:kintama = testicle/testicle of gold]

145
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,690
Do not speak about testicle!

146
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,530
In any event, it is necessary to return
at the place where was Robin!

147
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,819
One cannot let make Eneru.

148
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,970
I included/understood!

149
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,910
Do not believe only that
will be enough to stop me!

150
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,700
I will follow your boat!

151
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,910
I know where it goes!

152
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,860
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

153
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,330
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

154
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,240
Very interesting, young girl.

155
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,619
I succeeded…

156
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,620
It crowned weapons there in
blue Sea, so that I see.

157
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,780
THUNDERBALL

158
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,340
They is very clever to create
a current to deviate the lightning.

159
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,880
That implies solids
weather knowledge.

160
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,840
But… that is not enough.

161
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:52,770
You seem to have already understood that if I increase the power, that will not function!

162
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,220
Isn't this?

163
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,430
I have another thing to make.

164
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,840
Disappear!!

165
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,279
I cannot dodge it.

166
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,849
It is you which will disappear!!

167
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,760
[Note:explosive ball mortal]

168
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,839
Die…

169
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,919
Afflicted.

170
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,129
Usopp!

171
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,759
Then it was you!

172
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,340
One met on the boat.

173
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,979
Is Euh… where Sanji?

174
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,139
Sanji-kun? It is him there too?

175
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,420
Good Ah, it did not arrive yet?!

176
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,279
I see.

177
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,569
Hello.

178
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,270
Hééé!!

179
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,039
Do I have to flee?

180
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,700
Would Usopp the hefty man flee?

181
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,910
You ES GOD AND THEN?!

182
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,950
Usopp!

183
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,119
Nami!

184
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,019
Yes?

185
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,099
What can I make?

186
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,899
Save me!

187
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,479
Cretin!

188
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,600
But came to you to save me or not?!

189
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,689
Ben…

190
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,939
I am not any more very sure.

191
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,989
THEN WHAT YOU INSANE?!

192
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,859
He well…

193
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,410
He well what?! SAVE ME, BROTHEL!!

194
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,029
To save you?

195
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,119
But finally, it is God see?

196
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,640
Oh, you ace reason!

197
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,209
With the Nami fact, this hat…

198
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,839
Yes, it is that of Luffy.

199
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,350
It was there very with
the hour but it fell.

200
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,549
But he did not die. He will leave himself there.

201
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,839
The arch flies away.

202
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,049
One cannot count on
Luffy to save us!

203
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,599
Exact!

204
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,009
Will be necessary to manage!

205
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,019
I do not want to die today!

206
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,460
Included/understood!

207
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,729
He!

208
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,729
Remain beside this electric tube!

209
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,609
It is perhaps the system of the boat!

210
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,900
It will not be able to launch
powerful attacks above!

211
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,480
Usopp! Look by-there!

212
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,029
Waver!

213
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,940
Our only chance
it is to jump with!

214
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,150
To jump?! From this height, one goes…

215
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,159
Not.

216
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,410
In the middle of the forest, it
there a zone of ilonimbus has!

217
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,120
If one can reach it, one will be saved!

218
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,120
I see!

219
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,070
Shit!

220
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,019
I will try to distract God!

221
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,849
Prepare!

222
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,130
Ok!

223
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,540
Take that, God!

224
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,389
usopp

225
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,930
[Note:Spell = Magic spell]

226
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,360
“You were inserted a needle
between the nail and the flesh! “

227
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,199
Aah!

228
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,579
The simple fact of thinking that of it hurt!

229
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,790
Idiot! Stop yourself the ears
if not you could die!

230
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,630
“You cut yourself the finger with a sheet
of paper right on the articulation. “

231
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,010
“You have five mouth ulcers
purulent on the gum!! “

232
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,830
Usopp!

233
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,349
In any event, I must all prepare!

234
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,930
If one wants to escape,
it is our only chance!

235
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,880
Usopp…

236
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,029
It is the right direction!

237
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,320
The ilonimbus are just
under this bean stem!

238
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,690
They is good! I am ready…

239
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,830
USOPP!!

240
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,140
Even if you just seek to flee,
it will not be easy with me.

241
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,090
Do you want nevertheless to test?

242
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,850
You cheeks with a hide-and-seek
mortal with God!

243
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
Usopp! Take my hand!

244
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,020
Your hand!

245
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,750
Even now,
do not hope to be saved!

246
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
Usopp!

247
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,510
You bar!

248
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,559
EL

249
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,750
Sanji-kun!

250
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,720
Start, Nami!

251
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,360
THOR

252
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,029
Await Usopp!

253
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,369
Why accelerate you?!

254
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,029
And Sanji-kun?!

255
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,199
It is necessary to flee!

256
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,840
You do not want nevertheless
to waste the sacrifice of a man?!

257
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,379
They finally jumped!

258
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,390
They did not include/understand yet with
what a not I am powerful?!

259
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,300
They are always also vulnerable.

260
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,140
He, God!

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,270
I have something to say to you!

262
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,100
But before that…

263
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,730
Thank you.

264
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,040
I sought fire
to light my cig.

265
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,910
Another thing?

266
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,919
Ouais.

267
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,510
Prepare with chialer.

268
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,489
What?

269
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,770
The Arch…

270
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,700
Prepare with chialer.

271
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,950
You… do not only say to me…

272
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,869
Dumb!

273
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,330
What you have
fact in the boat?!

1
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:59,460
Rebellious army VS the royal army!

2
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:59,460
The battle will be in Alubarna!

3
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,000
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,600
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,940
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,370
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,820
Separated from Vivi and its crew, Luffy faced all alone Crocodile.

8
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,590
But overcome by its phenomenal power, it sank in sands of Arabasta.

9
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,970
Although it was saved of accuracy by Miss All Sunday,

10
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,750
the wound mortal inflicted in Luffy makes that its re-establishment seems improbable.

11
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,550
During this time, Vivi and the others carry on their road towards Alubarna.

12
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,040
While crossing the vast one extended from the country, they were helped by certain single creatures of Arabasta…

13
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,930
… and advance more and more towards their final destination.

14
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,750
Vivi and his/her friends must try to prevent the battle.

15
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,080
But the rebellious, strong army of its 2.000.000 men, is almost with the doors of Alubarna!

16
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,230
The Sand glass of the Destiny counts the last seconds before the end.

17
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Meat…

18
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,430
Hey, you!

19
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,140
Does Ca go?

20
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,910
Meat…

21
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,750
Meat!

22
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,560
Meat?

23
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,290
About what you do speak?

24
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,950
Hold out!

25
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,820
Wait. I take you along in a doctor.

26
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,780
This dumb of Crocodile…

27
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,980
I will make him pay.

28
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,010
To say as many conneries of Vivi and Ossan…!

29
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,720
It will pay it to me!

30
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,930
But which are you thus with the Juste?

31
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,850
Meat!

32
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,780
I see it!

33
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,430
It is still far, but I can see Alubarna!

34
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,290
Kohza, we will be there in less than 30 minutes!

35
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,370
Well!

36
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,970
CLOSE ALUBARNA EAST!

37
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,700
BE READY WITH THE COMBAT!

38
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,330
OUAIS!

39
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,060
Chaka-Sama!

40
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,000
The Rebellious Army was seen with approximately 15 kms in the south!

41
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,920
Very soon, 2.000.000 of rebels will start to attack the Southern Door!

42
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,000
Is!

43
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,690
West!

44
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,510
South!

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,360
South-east!

46
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,150
South-west!

47
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,040
Defend each door until the end!

48
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,680
DO NOT LET THEM PUT ONLY ONE FOOT IN THIS CITY!

49
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,840
YES!

50
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,920
Alubarna - Western Door

51
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,520
He, He! Look at over there!

52
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,200
I can see the rebellious army!

53
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,250
They are so numerous!

54
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,300
The Princess must be insane to think of being able to stop them!

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,350
But this insane…

56
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,490
… really will come?

57
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,010
Will it really come?

58
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Or not to come?

59
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,450
Or is it coming?

60
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,710
Or not to come?

61
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,920
It is too ambiguous!

62
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,450
He, He, He, He, He, He!

63
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,450
Should Ca be good? They is good?

64
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,210
They really come!?
This Princess and these pirates!

65
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,170
With this pace, the Army Rebels will be the first here!

66
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,350
They do not want to stop this battle any more!?

67
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,710
There are strong chances that they do not arrive in time.

68
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,350
They enormously wasted time with Rainbase, after all.

69
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,790
What, are you serious!?

70
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,940
But if the rebellion starts before they arrive there?

71
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,430
What will we make?

72
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,790
We will not do anything.

73
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,300
Once the started combat, even the Princess will not be able to do anything.

74
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,750
All that one must do is to kill those which one orders to us to kill.

75
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,620
It is so complicated to include/understand for you, queer?

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,090
What would you say to taste my Kenpo!?

77
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,970
Thus stop, you two.

78
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,340
Ah!

79
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,070
My hip!

80
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,180
My sciatica!

81
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,160
R--E--G--has--R--D--E--Z I--L--S.A. --R--R--I--v--E--N--T…

82
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,000
Mr.4, massage!

83
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,250
WHAT!?

84
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,290
Why you it known as step more early, weak!

85
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,180
Super Mallards!

86
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,920
Super Mallards?

87
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,780
What do you see, Miss Merry Christmas?

88
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,190
Aren't they too numerous?

89
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,310
I count six of them.

90
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,070
After the elimination of Straw hat,
there should remain only 4 about it.

91
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,350
You are mistaken, Miss Merry Christmas.

92
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,180
You did not listen to the speech of the Boss?

93
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,310
This Mr. Prince is with them.

94
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,110
If they are two moreover, the account is good.

95
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,820
What imports how much there is moreover,
we must just eliminate Vivi.

96
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,980
Why tergiversate?

97
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,910
Mr. 1.

98
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,180
“We must just eliminate Vivi”?

99
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,380
Eh well…

100
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,890
WHY DON'T YOU SAY ME WHICH IS VIVI!?

101
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,130
They carry all the same coats!

102
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,990
And these birds are fastest of Arabasta.

103
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,290
The squadron of the Super Mallards!

104
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,520
Bandage rats…!

105
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,400
Which of you is Vivi!?

106
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:39,450
It IS TOO AMBIGUOUS!

107
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,440
FIRE, Mr. 4!

108
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,840
Attention, you draw aside!

109
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,460
They dodged it!

110
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,540
These birds are fast!

111
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,900
Two of them passed to the South!

112
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,180
They divide!

113
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,600
I bet that they go to the Southern door!

114
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,300
It is there that the army rebels moves.

115
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,810
One of them must be Vivi.

116
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,860
THESE TWO ARE IT FOR ME!

117
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,820
Allons-y, Mr.4!

118
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,120
Mr. 1, y' has two of them which flees by there!

119
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,420
One of them can be Vivi!

120
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,170
They project to enter by the Western door.

121
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,110
These bastard…

122
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,490
Allons-y!

123
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,810
One…

124
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,770
Two!

125
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,840
Good! We direct towards the South-western Door!

126
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,580
On the five doors of Alubarna, three of them can be crossed by the West.

127
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,510
They try to enter the city separately.

128
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,850
It does not matter! We will eliminate them inside!

129
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,970
You will not escape to me!

130
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,480
He. Somebody assembles the steps!

131
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,140
The enemy!?

132
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,480
Not, wait!

133
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,580
It is the squadron of the Super Mallards!

134
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,410
Let pass them!

135
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,080
I will not leave you…

136
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,660
… to enfuiiir you!

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,620
I am so happy that you followed me up to now!

138
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,650
How?

139
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,100
Stop! Stop!

140
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,770
One can say that you are malignant!

141
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,380
Yes. I am Princess Vivi…

142
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,110
What you…

143
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,570
D-say?

144
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,640
It is me true the Vivi.

145
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,350
I think that one can stop there!

146
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,120
One had fun, my expensive.

147
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,400
Now…

148
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,590
It is time to show our truths faces!

149
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,620
DAMAGE, PERDUUUU!

150
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,130
WHAT!?

151
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,100
Thank you with all…

152
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,090
I must hurry.
The rebellious army is almost on us!

153
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,140
Allons-y, Karu!

154
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,940
Vivi and Kohza…

155
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,850
… do not have to meet.

156
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,500
A CAMEL!?

157
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,890
And you?

158
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,220
D-DESOLE!

159
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,760
Go ahead Zoro, smashes them!

160
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,290
YOU WANT TO CLOSE IT WELL!?

161
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,870
Stop them and I will forget your debt!

162
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,070
Which disappointment…

163
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
ONE IS ALREADY FREE!

164
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,800
One has any forgery.

165
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,380
Your rebellion will not take place today.

166
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,890
What do you have says!?

167
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,020
I will stop them!

168
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,390
I must stop them here,

169
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,450
or all our efforts will have been vain!

170
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,950
Fix the guns correctly!

171
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,770
Do not let them roll stupidly!

172
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,020
During the bombardment, do not break the formation!

173
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,660
Made attention with your boulets de canon!

174
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,330
This grondement is unreal.

175
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,880
We face a mad enemy of more than 2.000.000 men.

176
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,400
It is normal that the ground trembles with their arrival.

177
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,750
Do not flanchez!

178
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
They is good, Karu.

179
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,550
You can go there.

180
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,050
They will not notice us even if they trample us.

181
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,350
Please, Leader…

182
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,580
Listen to what I have to say to you…

183
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,270
ALL UNITS!

184
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,470
WE WILL ENTER BY DOOR CUS!

185
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,580
THEN ALL THE OTHER DOORS WILL FALL FROM THE INTERIOR!

186
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,200
WITH THE ATTACK!

187
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,740
YES!

188
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,700
STOP YOU, REBELLIOUS!

189
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,560
THIS BATTLE EAST A BLOW GOES UP!

190
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,310
PLEASE, LISTEN TO WHAT I AI HAVE TO SAY to YOU!!

191
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,120
REBELS, STOP VO…

192
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,550
He!

193
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,040
You did not see a person by there!?

194
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,970
A person!?

195
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,110
It is not the moment to be delirious!

196
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,720
Especially that they started to draw us above!

197
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,850
What?

198
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,230
They cannot any more see me, now!

199
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,430
How the Royal army can make a similar idiocy!?

200
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,320
SPECIES Of MORON!

201
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,990
I AI NOT DO NOT GIVE the ORDER TO DRAW!

202
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,140
Do not act without one giving you the order of it!

203
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,270
J I excuse myself.

204
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,980
By inadvertency… my hand slipped.

205
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,170
You do not stop, advance!

206
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,670
It is right a sand cloud!

207
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,180
NOT, STOP, PLEASE, STOP!!

208
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,340
For the good of our country, we will détrônerons the King!

209
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,270
Leader!

210
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,790
LEADER!!

211
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,310
What do you have, Kohza?

212
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,690
Not, it is nothing.

213
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,870
Was this my imagination?

214
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
Leader…

215
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,460
Listen well!

216
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,030
It is our final combat!

217
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,220
YES!

218
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,100
Wait! Listen to me!

219
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,540
LEADER!

220
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,790
They approach!

221
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,480
Prepare you to make fire!

222
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,610
LET US RELEASE ALUBARNA!

223
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,440
Karu…

224
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,820
You protected me…

225
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,520
Excuse me…

226
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,640
One did all that one could…

227
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,160
But the rebellion started…

228
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,760
Forgive me…

229
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,610
But… I will stop them!

230
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,130
I will still test, as much once than it will be necessary!

231
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,800
I cannot have done all that in vain!

232
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,510
On this boat… it is what I learned!

233
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,700
I will never lower the arms!

234
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,280
Vivi!

235
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,970
You were thus there!

236
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,360
Usopp-San!

237
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,080
You can arrive still there!

238
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,110
Quickly, goes up!

239
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,380
Yes!

240
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,030
But, Karu…

241
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,660
This bird can nothing any more make!

242
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,790
If one does not hurry, the rebellion will gain ground!

243
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,130
Come quickly!

244
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,370
This… bird…?

245
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,070
Allons-y, Karu!

246
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,350
What arrives to you?

247
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,850
Hurry and goes up!

248
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,830
Usopp-San.

249
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,320
Prove it.

250
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,750
What?

251
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,220
You doubts of me?

252
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,150
Look at!

253
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,010
NOT!

254
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,320
Usopp.

255
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,460
He, Usopp!

256
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,340
Matsuge, upright!

257
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,070
Ah, Sanji.

258
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,610
Hello.

259
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,760
Ah, my combat against this type?

260
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,350
The part of the plan where it had to be deceived was successful perfectly.

261
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,980
But then…

262
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,100
Ca lasted two seconds.

263
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,440
One second for each one of us.

264
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,780
Could to you have better done!

265
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,050
But are Sanji, why you here?

266
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,640
Your Mallard invited me to come to save you the round loaves!

267
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,110
Oh.

268
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,880
At all events…

269
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,410
Mr. 2 was made the trunk.

270
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,060
Yes.

271
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,590
Shit…

272
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,380
Listen, the transformations of this bastard of pervert are perfect.

273
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,440
He could become any among us to be caught some to Vivi.

274
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,660
If you have most slightest doubt small on one among us,

275
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,160
remove your binding and show this mark.

276
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,080
If they cannot, they are impostors.

277
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,980
Ca does not resemble itself to think of such intelligent tricks like this double mark.

278
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,230
Ca must mean that you are this bastard of pervert!

279
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,620
I WILL CUT YOU OUT OF DISCS!

280
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,480
Ah not, it is Zoro.

281
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,090
Ouf… it is Zoro.

282
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,710
You… are not Usopp-San…

283
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,550
Well…

284
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,490
I wonder how you uncovered me.

285
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,120
I thought that it was perfect.

286
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,900
Zéro-Chan said to me that you carry all same white binding on your arms…

287
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,760
They is bad…

288
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,040
Vivi-Chan is in danger!

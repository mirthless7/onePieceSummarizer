1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,699
Isn't this the moment to have the heart Net of it?

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,349
If this woman is our enemy…

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,539
Or our friend.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,599
Another thing Iceberg-san, why do you have the research opinion of Nico Robin in your room?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,130
Does Ca disturb you?

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,690
A little.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,499
It is preferable that you would not be with the current.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,409
It is a demon.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,229
This evening, you will enter again to Iceberg.

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,139
Of all the apprentices of Tom who could have it in their possession…

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,159
Only still in life is Iceberg.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,169
It does not matter how you reach that point…

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,949
In the name of the CP9, we will take it to him this evening.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,160
Remember that this mission is for the good of justice.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,459
If something occurs, it will be this evening. One goes there?

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,579
One goes there.

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,649
Which is our goal?

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,550
To catch Robin.

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,620
It is the only means of more.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,099
It is true, one wastes time to reflect.

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,360
But it is the only way of knowing the truth.

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,029
Yosh, I will do my better, me too.

23
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,080
Then, allons-y…

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,360
In Galley it Company.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,640
The guy, remain on your guards!

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,719
If one lets pass a pirate, we will be the shame of Galley it.

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,489
Do not let them enter!

28
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,039
Protect Iceberg-san!

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,979
No pity for the assassins!

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,249
How that occurs to the back.

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,899
All the entries of the fortress are blocked.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,309
All is under control.

33
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,109
Approach if you dare it!

34
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,680
We all will catch them one by one!

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,019
How is that presented, Chopper? Does Ca move?

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,109
It still occurred anything.

37
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,450
But…

38
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,839
Everyone is armed, and they have the air strapping men.

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,589
Obviously. These carpenters can overcome pirates.

40
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,769
We must act prudently and at the good moment.

41
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,210
With the least forgery not, one is foutu.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,049
It is you who says that?

43
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,409
I know you, you will sink lowered head

44
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,139
Chopper, we do not know with what to await us.

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,690
Describe us until more the small detail.

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,169
Informed us with the least movement.

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,369
Yes, of agreement.

48
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,979
The night is likely to be long, then remains concentrated.

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,489
If we let pass this chance…

50
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,769
We will set out again bredouilles.

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,729
We will not be likely second to find Robin.

52
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,419
We are not entitled to the error.

53
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,480
Ouais, one will catch Robin, I am sure.

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,900
The signal is the explosion!
The CP9 passes to the action

55
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,280
Kalifa.

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,589
Yes, Iceberg-san.

57
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,279
Me, could you excuse leave me only a moment?

58
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,689
Of agreement.

59
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,789
And then…

60
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,200
Sendings me Paulee.

61
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Yes.

62
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,910
Paulee.

63
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,219
Iceberg-san has something of important to say to you.

64
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,509
Me?

65
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,309
Yes, you only.

66
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,840
I will be with the secretariat. Call me if there needs.

67
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,719
From what you will discuss?

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
I know anything of it.

69
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,230
ITS LAST WILLS?!

70
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,799
He said that it was important.

71
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,360
Quickly will join it.

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,619
One will move away from the door.

73
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,740
Yes.

74
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,249
OF WHAT WANTS IT TO SPEAK WITH PAULEE?!

75
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,139
Connaissant Iceberg, it is surely in connection with the government.

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,550
With the fact, news of the pirates?

77
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,629
According to the searchs for Kalifa, they are Sept.

78
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,319
The captain Luffy with the straw hat, Zoro the hunter of pirate and Nico Robin.

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,909
The girl, and the type with the long nose which was with the dock n°1 this midday.

80
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,199
Yes, and with the two remainders, the account is good.

81
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,969
Their goal does not have any more importance.

82
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,699
If they enter here, they are foutus.

83
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,050
We will catch them all to finish some with them.

84
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,419
Yes, I include/understand.

85
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,939
You could find you in danger.

86
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,759
I reflected much, you are the only one from whom I can request it.

87
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,639
Can you take the responsability for it?

88
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,400
Do not worry you. Let me make

89
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,129
I count on you.

90
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,350
I go there immediately.

91
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,539
Is maintenance finished?

92
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,259
Ouais.

93
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,929
I will make a turn.

94
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,199
Afflicted but I must leave you a few moments, of agreement?

95
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,169
Not engraves. Even to four, one is largely sufficient.

96
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,320
Of agreement.

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,050
Take care of Iceberg-san.

98
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,619
Listen to me, Paulee.

99
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,499
On the right under the table of the main office…

100
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,389
If you turn over the carpet…

101
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,860
You will find a trunk.

102
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,050
That one.

103
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,579
I will tell you the combination, then listening well.

104
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,080
Initially, six on the right.

105
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,649
Ka-cha

106
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,579
Ready summers you?

107
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,639
Yes, they is good.

108
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,079
Then I launch the diversion.

109
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,469
To the 4 remainder,
to announces want to carry out your mission.

110
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,069
Included/understood well. In the name of the CP9.

111
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,399
They is good, Nico Robin?

112
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,869
Yes.

113
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,080
When you want.

114
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,480
CA EXPLODE!

115
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,849
It was what this explosion?!

116
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,939
Quickly, of water!

117
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,219
Move the casualties in sure place!

118
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,509
Quickly! Extinguish fire!

119
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,219
It was a shell?!

120
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,109
Not, it came from null leaves!

121
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,799
That planned summer!

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,199
Ca burns! Dispatch you to extinguish!

123
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,310
Give me a knack!

124
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,860
It is the signal.

125
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,630
Allons-y.

126
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,079
The explosion took place on the northern face! Is everyone well?

127
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,160
How half among you remain at their stations!
We did not locate the enemy yet!

128
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,669
Be ready to draw, reinforce the défences!

129
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,350
Do not let them return in the building of the company!

130
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,449
YOU ARE WELL, ICEBERG-SAN?!

131
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,929
Ah, that frightened me.

132
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,629
I saw somebody!

133
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,679
They are disguised! Capture them!

134
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,320
THEY ARE THERE!

135
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,209
LEAVE THEM TO ME!

136
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,699
I will deal with them.

137
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,050
He! Wait!

138
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,760
Good…

139
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,229
By there! Catch them!

140
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,809
Do not let them escape!

141
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,609
It is alone! Encircle it!

142
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,860
Approaches, assassin of pirate!

143
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,830
It is assembled on the roof with its whip!

144
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,469
You believed that there would be nobody on the roof?

145
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,719
Do not underestimate the craftsmen of Galley it.

146
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,199
How oses you of the acts as insane as the meurte?

147
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,629
Prepare, pirate!

148
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,709
We will never forgive each other!

149
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,439
You would make better stop.

150
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,080
You are not size against me.

151
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,129
Two people arrive by there!

152
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,650
They move towards the entry of behind!

153
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,309
Catch them! Do not let them enter the building!

154
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,550
Continue them! Dispatch you to capture them!

155
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,240
Do you remember the plan of the fortress, Nico Robin?

156
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,230
The carpenters do not know any more where to give head.

157
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,950
That becomes more and more annoying…

158
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,160
What do we make? Do we have to enter?

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,980
Hein? Where is Luffy?

160
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,989
REFLECTED A LITTLE BEFORE ACTING!

161
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,900
AHO-CAPTAIN!

162
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,560
Too much late…

163
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,139
The door of behind! They move towards the door of behind! Wedge them!

164
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,360
Do not let them escape! Stop them!

165
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,329
You have notch to show you in spite of so many guards?!

166
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,929
Do not make fun you of Galley it!

167
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,389
You, who have to dare to raise the hand on Iceberg-san, your destiny is sealed!

168
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,580
Appointment!

169
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,809
You will not go further, pirates!

170
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,069
Appointment now and show your face!

171
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,609
We will capture you and trap the others!

172
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,850
Assassins!

173
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,999
They prepare a dirty blow!

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,640
FIRE!

175
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,119
They are disappeared!

176
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,279
It is a joke!

177
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,579
What happens there?

178
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,470
Where are they?

179
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,289
Are Oi, you well?

180
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,629
Extremely…

181
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,129
Who is this manager of whip?

182
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,029
It moves in the airs.

183
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,789
Impossible.

184
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,229
To move in the airs?

185
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,180
All this is not reasonable.

186
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,859
It jumped!

187
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,120
GENPO!
[Not on the moon]

188
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,330
Still, it jumps in the airs!

189
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,370
[Jet of spines]

190
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,959
I had warned you.

191
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,999
Here it is!

192
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,429
Court! It jumps in the court! Encircle it!

193
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,110
Oi, by there! All on it, one will have it!

194
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,370
It is that…

195
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,140
Would this be the goods of Mr. Iceberg?

196
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,160
Bring to me that.

197
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,200
You do not know anything of his true value.

198
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,959
Who are you? From which do you leave?

199
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,399
Darkness.

200
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,239
According to our charter, we represent justice.

201
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,859
The secret organization…

202
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,310
Cipher pol. Number 9.

203
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,039
From where that you came, you should have crossed the craftsmen.

204
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,309
Who knows…

205
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,049
Perhaps that yes…

206
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,090
Perhaps that not.

207
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,920
My memory is lacking to me.

208
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,149
The attempted murder of yesterday is nothing beside this evening.

209
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,409
We remained quiet on this subject…

210
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,259
At all events, give to us the treasure of Mr Iceberg.

211
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,239
And you, who maintaining know some too much…

212
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,920
Give us your life.

213
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,599
In the name of justice…

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,980
Immediately, here.

215
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,779
Did you find both which disappeared behind?

216
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,159
Not, they are untraceable!

217
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,889
And inside…

218
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,949
There are a guard with each door and fenètre!
It is impossible for them to enter!

219
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,849
Shit, dumbs of pirates, where are parties?!

220
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,799
They must hide some share!

221
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,159
Still seek!

222
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,360
We must absolutely capture them, included/understood?!

223
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,400
Behind this wall.

224
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,830
Yosh, pushes now!

225
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,439
Which surprise.

226
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,210
I knew that you would come in one way or another…

227
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,779
But not by there.

228
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,219
Do you have to use the same technique yesterday evening?

229
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,389
Normally, there is no door here.

230
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,369
It is the Doa-Doa fruit. [Doa = carries]

231
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,649
Can-import the hardness of the wall,
the part which I touch this exchange in door.

232
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,280
As long as there is a wall, I can enter and leave as I like it.

233
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,699
What? We did not receive the signal yet.

234
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,889
They did not say that one could not weaken it, it can still speak.

235
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,679
A good cook never neglects the preparation of the ingredients.

236
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,539
It is to prevent that it tries anything before the signal…

237
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,329
Nothing to leave randomly and prevent the least movement,
it is as that which the professionals work.

238
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,660
This would be…

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,340
Methods of the CP9?

240
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,139
You very included/understood.

241
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,050
It is true.

242
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,339
I was mistaken in connection with Straw hat.

243
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,800
It had nothing to do with all that.

244
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,839
You do not have with you to make some.

245
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,320
You told truth while affirming to have seen me.

246
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,089
Did Ca form also part of the plan?

247
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:47,289
Yes. To leave you in life and to make show the pirates.

248
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,609
And if we had to kill you…

249
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:58,010
Our objective, the sketches of a certain boat, would not have been achieved.

250
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:05,180
This object is transmi between carpenters from generation to generation.

251
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,499
Whereas you felt your life in danger…

252
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,689
You wanted to entrust it to someone else.

253
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,439
And the designated man was the engineer of the Dock n°1, Paulie.

254
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,569
Our companions deal already with him.

255
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,149
Then all occurs…

256
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,870
As you had envisaged.

257
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,819
They would seem that all is held perfectly…

258
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,259
Yes.

259
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,229
I will deal with the engineers of outside.

260
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,459
Nico Robin, débarasse us of this man then.

261
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,020
When they take the croqui hands of Paulie, they will contact you.

262
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,210
This moment, Iceberg must die.

263
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,539
Afterwards, we will kill Paulie which knows the truth, and the mission will be finished.

264
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:04,710
The crew of Straw hat will be all the wrong against him.

265
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,369
Whore.

266
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,259
Why does he never listen to but one says to him?

267
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,349
He always does that.

268
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,719
But…

269
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,369
Robin is surely implied in all that.

270
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,229
What will one make? We must remain discrete!

271
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,179
But it is also a chance for us.

272
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,479
Do you think that Luffy entered the building discreetly?

273
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,439
Surely not.

274
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,829
Not, Not.

275
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,629
It had to enter without making details in the fortress.

276
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,349
Without knowing where it goes and pursued on all the sides.

277
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,509
You think what of it?

278
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,719
Completely of acccord.

279
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,989
Of agreement, agreement.

280
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,389
It is true? According to the engineers, it is him which is behind all that.

281
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,699
Thus if the leader appeared, everyone east were put at its continuation.

282
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,099
What wants to say that the reinforcements at the entry must be now reduced.

283
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,919
It is necessary to benefit from it…

284
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,079
To infiltrate us inside.

285
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,149
I see. Thanks to Luffy, we are likely thus to enter.

286
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,669
Of agreement. Then one can sink without risks, not truth?

287
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,299
Let us jump this barrier.

288
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,209
One sinks, of agreement?

289
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,259
Yosh, one enters!

290
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,790
Let us follow Luffy!

291
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,269
WHY ALL THIS WORLD?!

292
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,329
Whore, I am wedged.

293
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,350
I wanted jumped in the fortress…

294
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,310
But I wedged myself and I cannot any more moved.

295
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,509
I cannot leave.

296
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,549
I must hurry.

297
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,700
Await me, Robin!

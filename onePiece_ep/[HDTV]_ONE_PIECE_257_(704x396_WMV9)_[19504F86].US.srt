1
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,549
The exit is close!

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,482
One directly will be propelled outside!

3
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:22,250
What? It is not true!

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,682
Yosh! Umi Ressha is there!

5
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,916
Go the guy! One goes there!

6
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,383
Jump! Sodome, Gomorrhe!

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,783
Straw hat!

8
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:51,883
All the members of Franky Family are with your service!

9
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:02,450
Brilliant!

10
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:06,316
It is of King bulldozers of higher class!

11
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:11,450
I wanted to also to join me to you.

12
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:14,183
These types which took on board your friend…

13
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:19,149
with me also because they are my enemies of
are taken with the life of Iceberg-san.

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,916
And then I have still many things to say to them!

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,050
Well, then…

16
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:29,183
Franky Family and engineers of Galley it…

17
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:34,450
There was small different downtown.
But now, we have a common enemy.

18
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:37,349
They is bad!

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,815
I said it to you.

20
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,583
My job was right to put the train on the rails.

21
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:45,650
Nothing can stop it now.

22
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,450
He, Luffy!

23
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,516
Now that we all go in the same direction…

24
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,316
there is no reason but one fights separately.

25
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,516
Listen! We are allied!

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,516
The guy! It is not one
large wave which will stop us!

27
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:05,116
One all will achieve our goal!

28
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,650
It LEFT!

29
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:16,015
Now, the guy, made
something against this wave!

30
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:20,116
Open fire with all the guns available!

31
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,850
I DEAL WITH CANON!

32
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,815
Franky Family! Do not move back vis-a-vis vagueness!

33
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,850
Prepare the guns!

34
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,383
Let us not waste time!

35
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,716
Pleasing more!

36
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,850
Ah, the baby Den Den Mushi sounds!

37
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:49,716
It is surely Sanji-kun!

38
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,116
What did it occur…?

39
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:06,783
Here too!

40
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,983
They all were overcome!

41
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:27,100
TO STRIKE THE WAVE!
THE POWERFUL COMBO OF LUFFY AND ZORO

42
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,050
Oï! You over there!

43
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,983
Yes, T-Bone Captain!

44
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,716
How were you made this wound with the arm?

45
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,949
I was made prick by an insect.
I scraped and that bled.

46
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,450
They are not good! We must stop the hemorrhage!

47
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,349
Use this while waiting.

48
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,050
Not! Do not use your invaluable cape!

49
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,583
That should go now. When one of my
men bleeds, that makes me nausea.

50
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,183
T-Bone captain…

51
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:23,916
I request so that the world is in peace each day.

52
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,450
Its head makes really fear.

53
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,815
Captain!

54
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,250
What do you have says?

55
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,615
J I did not still say anything.

56
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:42,050
If there is something which I can do,
even if I must leave the life there…

57
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,983
Not.

58
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,749
All officers of coaches 6
and 7 were made massacre!

59
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,650
And the two criminals also disappeared!

60
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,716
How?!

61
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:00,482
It is not known if there were an intruder or
if they are escaped by themselves!

62
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:03,349
It is terrible…
We must save the life of our men!

63
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,415
Defer the situation to all the coaches!

64
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,316
Yes!

65
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:11,282
Nami-san! Nami-san,
do you hear me?!

66
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,250
Yes! It is you, Sanji-kun?

67
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,415
It became a dangerous hair here.

68
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,916
Dangerous?

69
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:22,215
Sanji-kun! What a is this voice?!

70
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:24,215
He! What it occurs, Sanji-kun?!

71
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:25,650
Oï! Oï!

72
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:29,682
Ah, all that because of an idiot!

73
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,250
I-idiot?

74
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,682
E-Encore! What it is?!

75
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:34,883
- Will Ca go?
What occurs?! All is well, Sanji-kun?!

76
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:35,550
What occurs?! All is well, Sanji-kun?!

77
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,016
- It is inevitable.
What occurs?! All is well, Sanji-kun?!

78
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,549
- It is inevitable? Oï…
- Which is an idiot?!

79
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,116
Not… because of two idiots…

80
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:52,716
Takes that!!

81
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,082
As I expected it, one
cannot create opening!

82
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,316
Not, it is not finished!

83
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:05,450
Move back all! Made place with
special gun of Franky Family!

84
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,183
Target, Aqua Laguna!

85
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:14,682
FIRE!

86
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:16,916
Super Canon Scrap!

87
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,815
Shit! Flancher is not necessary!

88
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,783
Continue to draw!

89
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:36,682
Bring more ammunition!

90
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,415
Of agreement!

91
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,949
Concentrate the shootings on only one and even not!

92
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,916
Draw on the same point!

93
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:45,215
Give your maximum.

94
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,549
The rails can, more or less, rise
with the top of surface…

95
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,050
but they cannot pass Aqua Laguna.

96
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,716
If it directly is struck,
even Rocket Man will not resist it.

97
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:58,116
Will one die?!

98
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,716
This is why I said to you to prepare.

99
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,650
Quoiii?! Us too?!

100
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,850
I thus see… Robin is still…

101
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:17,149
Moreover… it would be said that you have fun.

102
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,983
He, Sanji-kun.

103
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:22,583
The reason which pushes Robin to be acted thus…

104
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,716
and our situation…

105
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,450
THE FARM!!

106
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,116
Listen, Sanji-kun.

107
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:37,483
I very will say to you in connection with what hides behind the actions of Robin and our current position.

108
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,016
Listen attentively.

109
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,149
One goes crasher!

110
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,949
Oh not! One died! One will die!

111
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,415
Stop groaning and continue to draw!

112
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,183
Open a way!

113
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,815
Oï, Luffy.

114
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:58,250
Ouais. In us to play, Zoro.

115
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,082
Oï! You do not stop drawing!

116
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,050
What you will make

117
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,450
One will draw…

118
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,316
a boulet de canon.

119
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:38,116
It is what the double of 108?!

120
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,149
216.

121
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,415
216, it is long and hard to say that.

122
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,783
It does not matter.

123
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,215
What they are making?!

124
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,682
What they intend to make with
naked hands and with sabers?!

125
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,615
They said that one was to continue to draw.

126
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:59,250
What you make?! Let us cover them!

127
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,116
Yosh… then 300!

128
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,183
One will strike the wave!

129
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:39,083
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

130
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,467
Yosh… then 300!

131
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,467
Ok!

132
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,933
One will strike the wave!

133
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,067
Sanji-kun…

134
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,533
They thus did it.

135
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,467
ONE… ONE PASSED!

136
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:08,867
AQUA LAGUNA WAS PASSED!

137
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,133
I believed that I was going to die!

138
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,467
Oï! Nami-san, all is well?!

139
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,200
Ouais, it is a miracle.

140
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:50,067
That it is well!
You are not pirates of shoddy goods!

141
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,632
They are frightening like enemies…

142
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:56,966
but as allies, there is not better!

143
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,566
STRAW HAT!

144
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,299
I was really persuaded that one was going to die.

145
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,867
They are incredible.

146
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,366
You do not slacken, the guy.

147
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,333
The storm yet was not passed.

148
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,533
From now on, nothing is feared!

149
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,699
It was funny!

150
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,699
Straw hat…

151
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,366
Be impressive for you!

152
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,333
It was superhuman!

153
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:28,533
Oh, sorry.

154
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,400
Luffy, come here!

155
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,767
It is Sanji-kun.

156
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,167
Yo, Luffy.

157
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,000
Ah, Sanji!

158
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,733
How does that occur for you? How is Robin?

159
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,600
Robin-chan is still captive.

160
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,033
Nami-san have just explained me the situation.

161
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,600
Ouais, I very heard.

162
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,067
I see.

163
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,733
Ah, therefore it is that.

164
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,333
Them foutre goes a beating.

165
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,800
Oï! Luffy, would not be ridiculous!

166
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,733
Say to him to wait until one arrives!

167
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,200
Oï, cook! You hear me?!

168
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,166
In this train, has full with dangerous type there…

169
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,600
That will go.

170
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:27,600
Zoro…

171
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,600
What did you want to make?

172
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:41,267
When you known ace that Robin had lied and that it
had let itself capture to save us…

173
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,600
You would have remained without anything to make?

174
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,600
Useless to try to stop it.

175
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,566
Finally, you are not so stupid that.

176
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:55,533
Oï, Marimo-kun! You worry for me?!

177
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:56,966
In your dreams! Cretin!

178
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,067
But unfortunately…

179
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,933
when I learned the reasons from the choice of Robin…

180
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,333
even an order of the captain…

181
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,133
could not stop me!

182
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:13,099
Why you broke it!?

183
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,933
I had full with things to request from Straw hat!

184
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,899
Hein? How I could the knowledge?

185
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,632
Should to you have said it earlier.

186
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,533
Why I should have said that?! Do not be unaware of me!

187
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,200
I ignore you…

188
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,267
I hope that they are well.

189
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,432
Granny! Made in kind make the train faster!

190
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,667
Faster?

191
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,533
Ouais! More rapiiide!

192
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:47,800
Calm yourself, the train already acquired its top speed.

193
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:53,000
And from now on, one cannot any more stop it.

194
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,400
It is thus what occurred
since I left the crew.

195
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:14,800
Robin-chan does not know anything in connection with the condition
of Merry or combat between Luffy and you.

196
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,133
Robin-chan sacrificed himself for us six, included you,

197
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,533
so that we all are healthy and safe.

198
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,200
It did it for us.

199
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:37,533
What a sad history!

200
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,800
Why you chiales?

201
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,467
Cretin! I chiale not!

202
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:54,167
Fact of shitting! Why?! Nico Robin with the reputation to be a démoniaque woman and without heart!

203
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,467
Then why this sentimental history of friendship?!

204
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,067
Robin-chan is just there.

205
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,533
It does not matter the situation, I will help it.

206
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:11,032
Franky, the leader of Franky Family, goes you
to give a knack, guy with the rolled eyebrows!

207
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:16,133
To be honest, I have also a reason of
to save Robin of the claws of the government.

208
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,899
But it is especially because tone
history tore me the heart!

209
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,400
Oï! Allons-y, Length-Conk!

210
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,700
I…

211
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,333
I do not come.

212
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,733
That does not relate to me any more.

213
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,167
And then, if our enemy is the government
world in person…

214
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,367
I do not want to be implied, and…

215
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,700
you will find Luffy and the others, not truth?

216
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,967
There is no more no reason so that remains with you…

217
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:49,633
especially after my ashamed behavior
and all the hard words which I could say…

218
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,233
I am sorry for Robin…

219
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,300
but for me…

220
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,533
I do not have any more any reason to help it!

221
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,600
I left the crew!

222
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,500
Hello.

223
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,466
O-Oï! How that, hello?

224
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:15,767
But where hope you to flee?!

225
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,033
That will go.

226
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,967
Leave it.

227
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,167
Which head of mule…

228
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:27,167
Find quickly!

229
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,767
There should be indices!

230
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,100
That… that will go!

231
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,167
Please, that preserves you!

232
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,266
Wanze-san!

233
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:42,199
Terrible things occurred in the train!

234
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,833
The farm! Terrible things occurred HERE!

235
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,833
Nero-san! The criminals are escaped!

236
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,000
How does that do without your side?

237
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,300
Nothing suspect?

238
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,866
Me also, nothing to announce.

239
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:00,700
I see.

240
00:21:16,867 --> 00:21:18,900
Ah! I found them!

241
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,267
Ah shit!

242
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:23,067
METALLIC STAR!

243
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,833
Who is there?!

244
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,233
Your friend explained me all the situation.

245
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,167
It seems that you wish to save an young woman.

246
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,167
I do not need another reason to help you.

247
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,900
Let to me fight with your with dimensions!

248
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,033
My name is…

249
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,000
Sogeking!

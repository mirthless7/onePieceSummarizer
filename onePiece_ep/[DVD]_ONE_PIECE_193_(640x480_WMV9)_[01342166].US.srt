1
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,740
While wanting to prevent Luffy
and Nami to reach the Arch,

2
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,460
Eneru releases its powerful Mamaragan.

3
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,700
Ca will not go, Eneru!

4
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,620
THIS GROUND SE WILL NEVER SUBJECT!!

5
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,519
Luffy approaches the Arch…

6
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,309
Return the Gold Bell!!

7
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,810
Now disappear
with this ashamed island!

8
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,120
RAIGOU

9
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:33,690
Gomu Gomu No Hanabi

10
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,190
Ougon Botan

11
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,540
RELEASE THE SKY!

12
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,549
MAKE IT SOUND, STRAW HAT!

13
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,130
RELIGHT THE FLAME OF SHANDORA!

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,850
And after having reached
the arch Maxim, Luffy…

15
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,180
complete finally its combat with Eneru.

16
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,669
With more!

17
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,689
I will sound you at the same time!

18
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,090
Gomu Gomu No…

19
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,180
Ougon Files

20
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,670
LET them HEAR It!

21
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:38,140
The war ends!
The dream resounds proudly with far

22
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,749
Can you hear it?

23
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,330
Papi Head of diamond! Large monkeys!

24
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,950
GOLD ISCED…

25
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:21,430
IS THE TOP!

26
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,850
C cretin succeeded!

27
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,069
As it is beautiful.

28
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,079
What a pretty sound!

29
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
What does that?
What is it?

30
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,040
I always knew that this day would come.

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,210
It is thus the bell
that Norland heard.

32
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,279
Suu…

33
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,540
This is…

34
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,430
the sound of the song of Vearth?

35
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,220
Does God… exist?

36
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,820
It is an exceptional miracle.

37
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,079
After 400 years of silence,

38
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,610
I had lost any hope
that it resounds again.

39
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,650
Large Karugara Warrior…

40
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,990
Can you hear it?

41
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,080
The Flame of Shandora resounds!

42
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,960
That it occurs
on our island?

43
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,859
Which is this sound?

44
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,149
This would be…

45
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,640
the legendary sound?

46
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,120
Can you it hear, Montblanc Norland?

47
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
We made you wait.

48
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,980
I hope that your descendant…

49
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,030
can hear it.

50
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,760
You also, you like to hear
this bell to sound?

51
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,570
Is owner,…?

52
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,089
Yes, it is that.

53
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,210
There is only one bell in the world that
one can hear of also far!

54
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,090
Does Ca feel the adventure, hein?

55
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,719
It is in the sky!

56
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,519
My heart is beating wildly!

57
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,469
These monsters which appear
with the impérionimbus…

58
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,830
There is a theory on them.

59
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,189
When human is held in
sky at a very high distance…

60
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,279
and that a light illuminates it,

61
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,410
a silhouette is projected
far behind him on the fog.

62
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,870
And it thus resembles
with a giant monster!

63
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,380
These monsters are thus in fact
people who live in the sky?!

64
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,670
How it is made that one was not with
current how of people lived in the sky?!

65
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:43,770
Ouais. It is a theory
tedious and forgotten…

66
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,130
But it would be said that it is true!

67
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,940
We hear the sound
large Gold Bell.

68
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,350
The Gold City exists in the sky!

69
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,119
Norland, my ancestor…

70
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,610
was not a liar!

71
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,040
And it is what is in the train of me
to prove this kid, since the sky!

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,990
He, kid.

73
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,110
Thank you.

74
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,350
[Note:On the Tee-shirt we can read
the kanji “Saru” which means “monkey”]

75
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,029
Owner?

76
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,569
That there
does it have?

77
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,510
You feel badly?

78
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,990
I am content that they are well!

79
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,850
I was so anxious!

80
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,010
Look at! Over there!

81
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,840
It is the arch of God!

82
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,600
And God!

83
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,850
He runs!

84
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,370
Eneru God and his arch…

85
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,950
run.

86
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,290
The sound of the Bell…

87
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,270
is the pride and the glory of
lost city. The Flame of Shandora.

88
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,480
The song of the island has
announced the end of the war.

89
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,319
Sounding after 400 years…

90
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,510
the bell of their promise.

91
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,419
The voyage from this floating island
and deadened was long…

92
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,910
But it always preserved
its distances memories.

93
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,130
Once, of the men entrusted
a message with this bell.

94
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,430
A sound reaching them
the most distant seas…

95
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,020
carrying its proud words.

96
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,220
And now?

97
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,520
It sounded.

98
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,980
Ouaip.

99
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,790
You believe that Papi and them
did monkeys hear it?

100
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,500
Ouais, I am sure.

101
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,580
We are there!

102
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,930
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

103
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,330
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

104
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,419
You, the strapping man there!

105
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,660
Hang this cord here!

106
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,730
Aisa, were you worries?

107
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,600
Here your treasure!

108
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,070
I do not want any!

109
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,030
Laki!

110
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,969
Others…

111
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,019
They are well.

112
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,830
Do not speak.

113
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,790
Y' has somebody by there.

114
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,640
I am alive?

115
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,480
Not, you need a treatment.

116
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,970
I can wait.

117
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,069
It needs some more than me.

118
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,710
Look at if you can help it.

119
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,480
He almost died.

120
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,209
It is true!

121
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,589
Its bones are broken!

122
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,799
They is not good!

123
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,059
Isn't He, it a warrior?

124
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,179
Him nothing is owed.

125
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,840
Ouais, I do not include/understand
not very well me either,

126
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,349
but it fought
with such a eagerness.

127
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,349
Hein? It is what that?

128
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,580
Sympathy?

129
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,630
I do not know.

130
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,010
Excuse me…

131
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,529
Is what it goes of
to leave, Tanuki-chan?

132
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,569
I am a reindeer!

133
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,470
Look at, I have drink!

134
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,820
Do not worry you. I go
to ensure me that it remains in life.

135
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,230
Thank you!

136
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,250
Pierre, will put back you with
blue sailors.

137
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,170
Pierre, quickly. Bring back them
families of the soldiers here.

138
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,770
Thus finally, the Bell
of Gold and the gilded arch of Eneru…

139
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,680
Ouais, they are
fallen both.

140
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,739
It is judicious being the City of Gold,

141
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,199
but with final it a name is right.

142
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,520
Our voyage without a round continuous.

143
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,829
I prefer to carry some
Dials rather than gold.

144
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,360
Once returned on the Sea
Blue, one will be able to find some more.

145
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,079
But you believe that Nami-san is well?

146
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,430
And where is Conis-chan?

147
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,259
You think that we can make confidence with the inhabitants of the Blue Sea for Wiper?

148
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,549
All will be well.

149
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,880
Aisa with the air to like them.

150
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,679
We should be dispatched!

151
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,889
If the enemy awakes,
all will have been done in vain!

152
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,689
Enlist all those which can move!

153
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,819
It is necessary to give up them
Priests with the Drifting Cloud.

154
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,470
Ok!

155
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,209
You of ace finished with him?

156
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,269
Yes, it needs rest now.

157
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,120
HEEEEE!!!!

158
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,140
Luffy?!

159
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,789
Nami-swan!

160
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,249
Conis-chwan!

161
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,830
Luffy!

162
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,549
You all!

163
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,870
Which joy of you
to re-examine healthy and safe.

164
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,149
I was so anxious,
but I could not…

165
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,399
Conis-chan, you worried for me…

166
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,570
Not, cretin.

167
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,799
Is He, they provisions?

168
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,569
Where did you find them?

169
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,729
In the forest.

170
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,149
The reserve of the Priests was discovered!

171
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,699
Y' in has still full!

172
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,599
But how you made
to go down from up there?

173
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,560
Gomu Gomu No Fuusen!

174
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
Besides, Conis, where is your father?

175
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,780
He well, in fact, it protected me…

176
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,080
And Eneru…

177
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,920
You want to say…

178
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,399
Conis-chan…

179
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,350
Conis-san…

180
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,310
Conis…

181
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,119
ONE SPEAKS ABOUT YOU!

182
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,270
Afflicted I am in life!

183
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,180
Father!

184
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,589
You were on the White Sea?

185
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,129
Yes, when I began again
conscience, I was in bottom.

186
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,670
Now, people who went
in Cloud End to go down from the cloud…

187
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,500
use of Milky Dials for
to turn over on the Sea of Opal.

188
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,840
But, they cannot turn over any more
on Angel Island which does not exist any more.

189
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,350
They come by here, towards Upper Yard.

190
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,940
Thank you very much, God!

191
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,400
This title does not belong to me any more.

192
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,509
I am sorry to have left you
in this horrible place during six years.

193
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,490
Please forgive me.

194
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,829
We lost our
hearth, Angel Island.

195
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,160
And Shandia lost them
village hidden in the clouds.

196
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,010
Is the war really finished?

197
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,739
Holy guard of
God disappeared, but…

198
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,700
Chief, tear a 400 year old
can it heal also easily?

199
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,150
Pfiou, I am gavé!

200
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,539
It is already the night.

201
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,879
Loans to be turned over to the boat?

202
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,249
Nami! About what you speak?!

203
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,839
What?

204
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,220
Once on the boat, I will be able to make a good gross nap in my hot bed!

205
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,639
Usopp, you ace heard it
what it has just said?

206
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,889
Ouais, I do not believe my ears of them!

207
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,180
If it does not include/understand, it one is missed as a pirate and anybody!

208
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,510
To include/understand what?!

209
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,640
It is what that?!

210
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,449
I return…

211
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,700
in the place legitimates of God!

212
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,710
In the sky, nothing will block
my field of view.

213
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,170
You all were harmful.

214
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,839
You will not have it!

215
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,510
It only belongs only to me!

216
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,630
Air ground, without limits!

217
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,930
Now, ahead, Maxim!

218
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,650
Direction my Divine kingdom
who illuminates the night…

219
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,200
Infinite ground, Fairy Vearth!

220
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,879
Where am I?

221
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,040
You are in the ruins of Shandora.

222
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,240
Gan Fall!

223
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,319
You should not move!

224
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,660
You are one living of the sky!

225
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,920
You must rest.

226
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,849
Chief!

227
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,110
We were captured
by the inhabitants of the sky?!

228
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,260
There can be no distinction
between the victims of a war.

229
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,610
But the Gold Belfry! Our
to have is always to protect it.

230
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,980
What it is?!

231
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,329
This is the beat
of a drum of war?!

232
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,400
There is fire with the ruins!

233
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,499
Abrupt step, Wiper.

234
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,049
Reflected before acting.

235
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,720
It does not matter which heroic pretexts justified a war in the past,

236
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,170
we live here now,
and the sky is our fatherland.

237
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,350
And this fatherland does not reject anybody.

238
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,559
But, right in front of my eyes…

239
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,970
Yes, you should see that by yourself.

240
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,109
For people gathered here…

241
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,190
the war is the thing
more unthinkable which is!

242
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,580
It is the festival!

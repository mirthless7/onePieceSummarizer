1
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:59,990
and of the recovery of Waver!

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:59,990
Plans of the resumption of gold

3
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,030
Good…

4
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,970
Go everyone, on the way!

5
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,970
Wait, He wait, oh!

6
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,960
What is there, Usopp?

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,330
Frankly, you then…

8
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,840
you intend to leave
like that, without reflecting?

9
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,070
Hein?

10
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,080
Like that, one will be done
to undoubtedly locate…

11
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Seven people who
move in group,

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,070
it is not a little obvious?!

13
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,540
Oh now that you
say, they are not false.

14
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,230
Then also…

15
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,050
in spite of this camouflage…

16
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,580
Merry worries me!

17
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,690
It is true that there…

18
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,620
However it seems to me well hidden, you
believe what it will be nevertheless discovered?

19
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,900
Not what to worry!

20
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,860
This old wreck,
nobody would like the emp…

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,780
Do not speak about wreck, does not speak about wreck
!! And then the problem is not there!

22
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,440
Good blood…

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,490
Me I always think of
what it could arrive to us,

24
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,950
when comes the moment when one will be
discovered, one will run, without no doubt!

25
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,660
Moreover, Naaaami!

26
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,430
Hein? Me?

27
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,570
By the way, that did you make of Waver?

28
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,400
Ah, zut!

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I hid it in
undergrowth and I forgot it.

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,730
Bin here….

31
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,530
Ah forgiveness, forgiveness!

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,460
Nami-san is delightful
when she forgets!

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,040
Hum… Let us leave the imbecile on side.

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,570
Listen, band of idiots…

35
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,750
I go now you
to entrust my strategy.

36
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,440
Open large your ears!

37
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,860
Tadam!

38
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,770
Ok.

39
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,480
Your attention, Mesdames and Sirs!

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,000
Therefore, here them
explanations of my plan.

41
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,840
Initially the team which undertakes gold:

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,580
There will be Luffy, Zoro, Robin and
then the Usopp-san captain.

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,790
After that, the team which recovers Waver:

44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,330
There will be Nami.

45
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,610
But also another…

46
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,680
Sanji!

47
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,490
Ouooooooh!!

48
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,490
Your plan is super, Usopp!

49
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,810
Let us make our possible unit, hein!?

50
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,940
Ouais, ouais.

51
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,360
Which ball.

52
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,190
What, dumb?

53
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,820
Say, Usopp…

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,260
I must still keep
the all alone ship?

55
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,170
Do not make any you!

56
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,350
The camouflage of Merry is perfect,
that does not fear almost anything…

57
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,210
Almost?

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,510
And besides, which us
will look after the every day?

59
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,790
Héhé, the Super Doctor!

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Argh!

61
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,390
Species of idiot!

62
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,710
I am not content
because you flatter me!

63
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,580
Small rascal.

64
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,230
Ok?

65
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,570
One is currently here.

66
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,730
The team of the Treasury will avoid the ordinary way
and to pass by shortest in direction of the treasure.

67
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,560
Nami, you remember
did the place where you hide Waver?

68
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,510
Ouais…

69
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,910
in a split in the east of the island.

70
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,750
It is necessary to cross a chain of
mountains which borders the crater.

71
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,540
It seems to me that it is on this side.

72
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,480
Hum, it is practically on the other hand.

73
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,760
By terrestrial way, that us
would take too much time.

74
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,990
He? Oh! I found!

75
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,970
Hein?

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,720
You have only with you to return there
of a draft with this boat.

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,870
What?

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,840
The place of return
will be here… in Going Merry!

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,370
Ouais!

80
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,840
Yes, what?

81
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,750
You are still there?

82
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,710
You can lay out.

83
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,120
“You must make sure that it will carry food
to its mouth to swallow it! “

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,310
It is what my Chief-Cock ordered to me.

85
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,560
Even if I were to leave this part…

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,910
a rule remains a rule!

87
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,670
You must eat without anything to leave.

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,350
This Jessica…!

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,760
You also, Sergeant!

90
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,900
Heiiiin?!

91
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,970
We prepared some in excess.

92
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,430
Hold, good appetite!

93
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,300
Sergeant, you hate
also broccolis?

94
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,010
Not, rather tomatos
and carrots…

95
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,560
Oh, Major!

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,850
Forgiveness, you were dining…

97
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,240
In this case, I
will not disturb you.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,380
Not, not, it is exceptional.

99
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,140
You fall to peak!

100
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,520
I precisely hoped to call you.

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,740
Commander, I let escape three
time the crew of Straw hat.

102
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,770
I present to you my excuse!

103
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,360
It is not the important one, that.

104
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,450
Say to me rather,
did you already dine?

105
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,190
Euh, not.

106
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,490
Not well, not well! It
is not well whole!

107
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,820
One cannot make
war the empty belly!

108
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,870
And then, as a superior…

109
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,860
you must show
the example with your subordinates!

110
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,870
O-Oui.

111
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,530
Useless to retain you…

112
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,630
Eat as far as you will want!

113
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,470
Can you transmit to him
what they was delicious?

114
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,660
Included/understood well!

115
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,950
Species of dirty hedgehog.

116
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,170
I will crush you!

117
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,150
You still, Commander delight.

118
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,740
The hour came.

119
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,420
We need
to reorganize the troops.

120
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,860
This plan consists in taking the initiative
in order to bar the road to them, it is that?

121
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,580
Exact.

122
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,730
Sergeant, prevent
immediately troops.

123
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,350
With your orders!

124
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,000
This is an emergency communication
for submission to each squadron!

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,770
Supervise the neighborhoods of
the door as well as bay.

126
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,300
What do I have to make my regiment?

127
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,060
When you train the crew…

128
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,090
Make patrol them
around the door.

129
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,810
Included/understood.

130
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,310
You!

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,940
What a surprised!

132
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,790
Enchanted you
to know, Konteriano…

133
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,070
Finally…

134
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,200
the special Inspector…

135
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,810
the lieutenant of frigate, Sheppard.

136
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,830
Commander Jonathon,

137
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,420
it appears that the pirates of
Straw hat have escaped you.

138
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,890
Not, not… undoubtedly they hide
still some share in this Fortress.

139
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:00,850
Oh I see, this is why you were in the train
of dining with unconcern, what a world of peace!

140
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,570
Not astonishing that this imbecile
peaceful of Hariguchi beat you.

141
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,050
Hum, excuse me!

142
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
No the concern!

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,970
Then? You have finally
located their hiding-place?

144
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,780
Yes, about, I suppose
that they will return to recover gold.

145
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,190
Gold, do you say?

146
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:28,620
Nevertheless they became weak,
valiancy and bravery is not enough.

147
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,420
Lieutenant, you have
wisdom to direct them.

148
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,940
I could grant to you
best troops…

149
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,330
What a joke!

150
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,640
You are ready to order
best troops, isn't this?

151
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,620
By the way, where the soldiers are who have me
confused with the pirates of Straw hat?

152
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,450
With what that would be useful to you it
to be informed about it?

153
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,720
It is for my report/ratio, naturally.

154
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,540
I had given the order to apprehend
at once all doubtful people.

155
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,250
They did nothing but carry out it.

156
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,810
I am somebody of
suspect, it is that?!

157
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,890
Being given the circumstances….

158
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,140
Our opinions are divergent.

159
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,800
I have just recalled me of a thing
to make, I will return to see you.

160
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,580
Are commander, you sure?

161
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,410
It is a Lieutenant of the District
General, it is well too proud!

162
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,500
He will not take it
command of our section.

163
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,360
Not, it is not a question of that!

164
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,110
Go, it is the hour of glory for
the strongest unit of G8. (???)

165
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,570
????

166
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,870
Still idle talk….

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,870
I am serious.

168
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,540
Bandage the stupid ones!

169
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,330
He, you!

170
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,660
Where the Commander of the ship is
Stanberry which arrived this morning?

171
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,940
Yes!

172
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,910
In this moment it is
occupied with the infirmary.

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,960
What, with the infirmary?

174
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,030
What it
card-indexes over there?

175
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,360
The majority of its crew is wounded,
he must be with the bedside of his men.

176
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,010
Make come it! Immediately!

177
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,500
Yes!

178
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:23,520
They aim at gold and I see one place where it could keep it in this Fortress…

179
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,140
You will see, dirtiness of Commander!

180
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,000
I will undertake the pirates of Hat
Straw personally and to destroy the fortress.

181
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,520
I wonder whether everyone is well.

182
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,370
Me I… S so sad!

183
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,360
The moon, stars…

184
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,280
then only with Nami-san
ballotante on this boat!

185
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,490
What a formidable situation!!

186
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,670
It is as in a dream!

187
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,150
What does it occur?

188
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,010
I have a bad presentiment.

189
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,650
Sanji-kun,
could you accelerate?

190
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,960
Ouuuiii!

191
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,270
Does Pas la pain to shout, of agreement?

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,320
And rows in silence.

193
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,620
Ouuuiii!

194
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,620
R.A.S on the right, R.A.S on the left.

195
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,430
I am unaware of where the Navy is posted.

196
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,280
One should not be pointed out!

197
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,250
If one passed unperceived with
that, it would be a miracle…

198
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,020
Mr. Length-conk, one has anything
to fear for the moment.

199
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,190
You could not say it earlier!!

200
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,310
It is in the train of ronquer….

201
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,530
Would be a little more serious!!

202
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,890
It is really relaxed!

203
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,660
Commander!

204
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,230
If our troops leave the split,

205
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,850
the guard of the base will be weakened.

206
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,720
We do not have the choice,

207
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,670
it is very right if we can
to overcome the enemy with the sentinel.

208
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,870
However, we cannot leave
these young people pavaner in the fortress.

209
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,970
What think you of forming
new recruits?

210
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,480
It is not possible, that
would be too risky for them.

211
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,550
I knew that you would say that…

212
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,210
this is why I kept
the secrecy until now.

213
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,970
In fact, we receive
many candidatures…

214
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,170
who come from
members of my section.

215
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,430
And just like us, they
like this Fortress.

216
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,680
Really?

217
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,580
In this case, let us let express them
their patriotic passion…

218
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,590
and let us make pass the order
that they lend strong hand to us.

219
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,170
Yes! They will be charmed, undoubtedly!

220
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,760
Here are which is made,

221
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,840
but I still have another thing
to ask you, Sergeant.

222
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,940
Yes…

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,920
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

224
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,390

GOMU-GOMU-NO-FANSUB

225
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,830
How? It is madness!

226
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,710
Stanberry cannot take the sea,
it is currently in repair!

227
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,810
What does not want to only say
the whole of the ship is defective…

228
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,440
It is true…

229
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,230
But…

230
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,630
we were taken in
a storm while coming here!

231
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,230
Several sailors
are hardly able to move!

232
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,840
Captain, would be you in the train
to insinuate something…

233
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,450
towards me, the special inspector
envoy by the General headquarter?

234
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,490
Not… I do not have anything
known as of such… But…

235
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,920
If you included/understood,
gather all the crew!

236
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,530
Half will accompany me, the remainder
will await my instructions with Painpiku.

237
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,030
I will show with these soldiers
fortress, power of the General headquarter!

238
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,290
He, Zoro!

239
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,080
You are to us, there?

240
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,530
Dumb! You me drunk!

241
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,890
Is Robin, it still far?

242
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,750
One is there almost.

243
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,250
Ouh there!

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
It is really over there?

245
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,530
One does not have any more but to jump.

246
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,080
Yes, according to the route of the chart…

247
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,000
Then the trunk
find inside…

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,930
Exact! It is necessary for us to infiltrate
this place, it is our short cut.

249
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,240
It is decided! One goes there!

250
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,020
Ok! One sinks in a draft!

251
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,340
Well!

252
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,200
One goes there, Usopp!

253
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Hein?

254
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,360
Dispatch, Usopp, magne you!

255
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,680
Say, one remakes it?

256
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,820
Do not talk cock! There will not be
not second once!

257
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,280
Well!

258
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,000
Pas de Marines in sight.

259
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:06,880
Shit!

260
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,720
Afflicted disturbance!

261
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,170
Nami-san, made attention!

262
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,870
Thank you.

263
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,320
They would be tedious if
the disorder was sown.

264
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,260
It is to better skirt
the coast from here,

265
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,360
because we do not have time
to lose unnecessarily with them.

266
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,830
Sanji-kun,
we dispatch!

267
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,060
Yes!

268
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,150
One is there almost!

269
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,100
Still an effort!

270
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,150
One grouille!

271
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,900
I found it,

272
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,330
it is enough to go down, it is near.

273
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,730
The trunk is at the end of the corridor!

274
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,980
Well!

275
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,630
Await us, treasure!

276
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,340
One arrived
up to now too easily,

277
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,570
It is equivocal.

278
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,740
Well!

279
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,500
D-of the pirates!

280
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,110
I you lay-aisserai step to pass!

281
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,250
Stop!

282
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,520
We do not have the intention
to destroy the fortress,

283
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,900
nor to try anything
the dangerous one towards you.

284
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,060
The farm!

285
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,250
I do not admit only whoever
comes to disturb peace!

286
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,060
Since I say to you that
we will do anything to you!

287
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,620
I do not believe in
words of the pirates!

288
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,290
To protect this fortress at the sides from
Commander is an honor for us!

289
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,090
In short, you would be ready to risk your life?

290
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,640
Obviously!!

291
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,900
Then, you should puff out and you
to smash even more with the drives!

292
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,630
It is what that?!

293
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,730
Impressing!

294
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,650
It is rather well reinforced!

295
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,190
It should be recognized that this place
appears ideal to contain gold!

296
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,140
I feel that there are other tricks
brilliant in addition to our gold!

297
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,910
And? What does one make?

298
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,640
Oh 'scuse, Zoro!

299
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,970
You…

300
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,910
I excuse myself…

301
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,320
It will not open by the force!

302
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,240
For this trunk,

303
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,980
one must turn these buttons…

304
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,790
So that the figures correspond, it is
there that the wheels in top will swivel

305
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,810
and the leaf will open small with
small towards the object of desire!

306
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,980
You seized well?

307
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,650
You will not go further!

308
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,100
They finally showed
their end of their nose.

309
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,950
Yes, one would say well…

310
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,730
I am Kurono Nezumi!

311
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,570
Appointment wisely, it
is not yet too late…

312
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,540
It is an attack with the dignity of one
pirate to withdraw itself in front of a treasure!

313
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,020
Good, after I count on vouuus.

314
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,940
He!

315
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,560
Cursed pirate!

316
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,230
They dared!

317
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,110
Fire!

318
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,820
Usopp, one entrusts the trunk to you!

319
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,760
Count on me!

320
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,210
Then Mr. Length-conk? Will that go?

321
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,000
It is perhaps the speciality
of Nami this kind of thing!

322
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
But with such a lock,

323
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,320
it is an easy work even for me!

324
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,700
Well!

325
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,210
First is engaged!

326
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,040
If that falls us above,
it is instantaneous death.

327
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,690
What! They are detached?!

328
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,000
It is enough that I gourre once
and it is a direct blow on cranium!

329
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,240
Now!

330
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,630
Luffy! Does not lengthen your
arm wrongly and through!

331
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,690
If not they you will slice them!

332
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,300
Ok!

333
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,180
And the second in fact!

334
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,490
Major, all supervisors
arrived on the ground…

335
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,410
The guard is finished.

336
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,150
Well!

337
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,610
Say to them to maintain it
statute-quo until new order.

338
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,140
With your orders!

339
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,450
More than 50 minutes…

340
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,150
Papaa!

341
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,930
Nice, Robin!

342
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,880
I was done encircled.

343
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,790
That will not finish any or
what!? They are heavy!

344
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,870
Usopp! It is not yet open?

345
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,600
It is open!!

346
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,750
Biiien!

347
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,110
All with the shelters!

348
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,050
Hein?

349
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,090
It is too funny this trunk!

350
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,560
What?

351
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,730
There is not… of gold!

352
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,100
You will not leave if
easily… Navarone.

353
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,990
All these many humiliations
sudden will be avenged.

354
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,330
Ouais!

355
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,490
All the Pirates of Straw hat will be exterminated by us, special gendarmerie of the general headquarter.

356
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,050
Ouais!

357
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,440
This is the last model of
portable bazooka nidel peg ladder!

358
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,020
Waah its tears!

359
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,140
Burst, Feu!

360
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,100
Go ahead!

361
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,820

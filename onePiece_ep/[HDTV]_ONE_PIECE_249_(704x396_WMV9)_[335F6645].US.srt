1
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:12,325
Break far from this island!

2
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:16,985
Dumb!

3
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:49,055
They smashed me well.

4
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:53,325
This dumb of man leopard!

5
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:55,855
Now that it did that to me,

6
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,325
It will pay it expensive to me!

7
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,585
SHIT!!

8
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:24,700
CONSPIRACY OF SPANDAM!
THE DAY OR UMI RESSHA TREMBLES

9
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,150
I see.

10
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,350
This part in sorry state was the old one
work place of the naval engineers,

11
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,950
the general headquarter of Tom' S Workers.

12
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,100
Naval engineers?

13
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,400
Tom, Iceberg, Cutty Flam.

14
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,660
Thus this place, expensive in your heart, is the place
where you built all the three of the ships.

15
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,060
In sometimes happening at the point to call that “a secret base”…

16
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,000
it is very puerile of your share.

17
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,200
Your mouths!

18
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,400
You from here now bar!

19
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,130
Only after having recovered it
that we came to seek…

20
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,530
Engineer Cutty Flam.

21
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,860
The plans are not here!

22
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,060
Well, precisely it is the kind of answer
that I awaited your share.

23
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,129
Hey!

24
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,000
Kalifa!

25
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,860
How is… what… I… will do?!

26
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,330
Dumb!

27
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,260
You do not hope to tell us the truth now.

28
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,600
Moreover, there remains to us an asset in reserve.

29
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,730
In connection with a history which goes back now to 8 years.

30
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,860
Where it would seem that you have committed a crime…

31
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,999
Just like Tom.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
Do not say anything! Tom-san is not a criminal.

33
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,730
Do not speak thus whereas you
know anything him, salts snotty-nosed kid!

34
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,800
Tom-san…

35
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,200
Afflicted.

36
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,460
Silence!

37
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,460
Since you are a criminal,
you know very well what awaits you.

38
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,400
Put yourself well that in cranium.

39
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,800
Franky… No matter what I say, do not stop me!

40
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,530
Dumbs, in connection with…

41
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Tom-san…

42
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,730
and Seven Toilets, you do not know anything!

43
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,600
- Seven Toilets, 8 years with paravant -

44
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,800
They said that the Court of Assizes
naval would come in 3 days.

45
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,600
Therefore, they finally will deliberate with
matter of the judgment of Tom.

46
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,400
What will occur?

47
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,930
All will be well.

48
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,260
Surely.

49
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,059
He held his promise after all.

50
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,260
Yes.

51
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,000
He will be necessary to transport the wood which
has just been delivered to the docks.

52
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,000
If not besides, how are held
negotiations with Poplar Saint?

53
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,660
Enough badly. They imposed their price to us.

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,859
And it is the same with iron of San Faldo!

55
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,929
Because of these prices, the treasury of
shipyard will be in the red!

56
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,860
The next time one will negotiate better than that!

57
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,460
Everyone is enthusiastic
to be able to cross the ocean…

58
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,330
but they still have much evil
to trade with the other islands.

59
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,800
I wonder whether the city will manage to be raised.

60
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,859
The men are full with resources!

61
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,929
The results are seldom immediate, Iceberg.

62
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,729
If a man made any possible sound,

63
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,130
it must be about it to trust!

64
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Yes.

65
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,659
Well the hello!

66
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,329
Is this you it naval engineer, Mr. Tom?

67
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,660
I sought you.

68
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,529
I am sorry to importune you,
I would like to speak to you about…

69
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,930
Do not stop me, break you from here!

70
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,860
Eh well, I would like to discuss a little with v…

71
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,260
I am Spandam of Cipher pol. number 5…

72
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,060
Spandam-san!

73
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, sorry!

74
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,800
I have well the impression to have amoché
somebody by my small hello!

75
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
And…

76
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,330
here the triumphal return of Super Battle Franky 35!

77
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,329
One succeeded in cutting down a monstre marin!

78
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,200
Look at how it is enormous,
it makes at least 100 meters length!

79
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,700
Will this moron thus stop never?

80
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,330
Super!
Will this moron thus stop never?

81
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,130
Dumb, stops that! Ahoberg!

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,529
How much time will have I to say it to you?!

83
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,730
Stop building warships!

84
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,600
Reflected a little!

85
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,729
If you do not get rid any, I will occupy myself some!

86
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,660
You insane of me! It is my warship,
there I will not let to you touch!

87
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,330
Nmaa~ listenings, Franky!

88
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,599
You killed a monstre marin with this machine,

89
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,699
you realize how much it can be dangerous?

90
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,699
I do not include/understand why you
guards this kind of boats.

91
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,000
You know very well that their goal is not
not to attack men!

92
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,000
These are not the intentions which worry me.

93
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,660
But they are your weapons and you in
be the person in charge, Bakanky!

94
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,860
Tom-san, please, say to him something!

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Bakanky tarnishes the image of our company!

96
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,930
Still with this nickname of Bakanky?!

97
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,999
Wait a little!

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,859
First of all make me excuses and

99
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,600
then listen to what I have to say to you!

100
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,530
You is government… it is in connection with the lawsuit?

101
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,260
Hein? About what do speak you?

102
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,730
Not… I do not know anything in connection with all that.

103
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,000
Tom-san…

104
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,660
What occurs with Tom-san?

105
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,930
They want to only speak with only.

106
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,060
He is in the warehouse with the type of the government.

107
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,460
Span… thing.

108
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,730
Spanda-trick.

109
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,859
They do not come from the naval Court of Assizes…

110
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,400
and they do not seem very gifted to communicate.

111
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,600
Not, I do not know anything of it!
I never had this kind of plan!

112
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,259
Stop lying!

113
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,159
I was polished with you but you refuse to cooperate!

114
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,499
We sought in any Water Seven
and we arrived to you!

115
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,260
It is enough to seek a little by here and
it quickly will be found made well done!

116
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,530
You have the authorization to inquire and to excavate me?

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,660
You do not believe so well to say, Tom!

118
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,730
I made research and it proves that you are
that which built the ship of Gold Roger.

119
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,000
I have all the rights with respect to a criminal like you.

120
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But all that the government knows it for a long time.

121
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What!?

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
It is impossible!

123
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,459
Then why are to you there quietly to build boats instead of being in prison?!

124
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,860
It is you which belong to the services of
information, gets information all alone. Goodbye!

125
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,329
Wait! I did not finish!

126
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,460
You know who I am?!

127
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,460
Ah yes, indeed…

128
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,260
Tom held the promise which it had
made at the naval Court of Assizes.

129
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,400
The audience will take place in 3 days and
its sentence will be surely cancelled.

130
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,000
It is a great man, this Tom.

131
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,130
It is a joke?!

132
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,600
Gracier a person who made
the crime to help Roger…

133
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,930
Indeed, then this type of things exists?

134
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,259
Yes,

135
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,329
in this moment even, pirates seek
to put the hand from these points of view.

136
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,199
So by misfortune, they were to fall into
other hands that those of the government,

137
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,660
nothing could stop them.

138
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,659
The great era of piracy saw it
day now 10 years ago,

139
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,530
and the pirates proliferate at sight of eye
and do not cease gaining in power.

140
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,329
We must make very quickly to prevent
the alarm clock of these old weapons,

141
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,000
for we who we claim justice,
we must be reinforced!

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,130
We must seize old arm
and to put an end to this great era of piracy!

143
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,959
Times change, it does not have no doubt there there above.

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,859
First of all, seize this plan,

145
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,530
we will discuss the remainder later.

146
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,130
We entrust this mission to you, Spandam.

147
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes! Trust me.

148
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:04,600
I trimé during years to arrive from there there, then I will not let pass this chance now!

149
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,130
One goes there!

150
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,859
Fact of shitting!

151
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,800
It is necessary that this type is regarded as a criminal so that I can conclude my mission.

152
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,660
Spandam-san!

153
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,930
A payment of your sorrow?! It is what one will see.

154
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,600
Hey, call 5 agents of the information in reinforcement!

155
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,460
Spandam!

156
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:56,929
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

157
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:04,000
MUGIWARA-TEAM

158
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,930
Iceberg, Franky…

159
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,260
Come by here both.

160
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,660
I have a thing very important to entrust to you.

161
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,400
This thing… really exists?!

162
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,399
The hand of the man… can build this thing kind?!

163
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,130
It is the worst monster of all the history
naval construction.

164
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,260
The government learned the existence
of this plan and it started to react.

165
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,930
It is too dangerous that I preserve it.

166
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,259
They is alarming but I included/understood well… I undertake some!

167
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,599
It is brilliant!

168
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Iceberg, let us try to build it!

169
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,460
Imbecile!

170
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,200
Reflected a little before speaking.

171
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,060
I will occupy myself some.

172
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,800
Such a thing should not exist.

173
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,000
Ouai, it can destroy the world!

174
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,129
But, you are free to do of them what you want.

175
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,130
You in, in the worst case disencumber.

176
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,400
Tom-san

177
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,660
And there is also another thing which worries me.

178
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,330
Hey, wait, Franky!

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,800
Hein, what?

180
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,959
Mets these pants!

181
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,829
You ace not included/understood yet?

182
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,600
If you go in bathing suit downtown it east
normal to make you deal with pervert!

183
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,530
Be to you shitting, I right outward journey will make races.

184
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,199
Go, hurries.

185
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,530
Whore!

186
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,129
One must prepare a feast to celebrate his innocence,

187
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,860
even if since the Tom-san beginning is not guilty.

188
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
In their turn…

189
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,800
Go Tom-san, Iceberg! Upright,

190
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,799
it is today that the audience takes place.

191
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Hurry of going to make you judge.

192
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,599
Quickly, let us go to the port!

193
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,530
The judgment of Tom will be marked!

194
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,060
This audience was very awaited.

195
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,329
The public came in mass.

196
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,000
One would say well.

197
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,600
Did you see Umi Reisha?

198
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,999
Yes. I am assembled on his board,

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,330
it is formidable it made of its project a reality.

200
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,659
Considering it honoured its promise by connecting the 4 islands,

201
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,460
nobody will oppose my indulgence.

202
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,059
Isn't Tom yet there?

203
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,730
It is not yet the hour?

204
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,799
You dispatch, if not there will not remain any more any place!

205
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,060
Ouais, one must attend the cancellation of its sorrow!

206
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,730
I so nostalgic, that am made already 14 years.

207
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,060
It is what this explosion?!

208
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,729
Dispatch you to evacuate the ship!

209
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,000
Quickly!

210
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,530
It is what that?! An attack of the pirates?!

211
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Shit, from which the attack comes?!

212
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,730
By there!

213
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,930
It is what these boats?!

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,330
I never saw these boats,
to what a pirate they belong?!

215
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,400
It is a armada warships!

216
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,200
You move away from the port!

217
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
You, fuyer dispatch!

218
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,260
Take refuge downtown!

219
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,330
With the help, help me, my son is under the debris!

220
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Why?

221
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:21,000
Who… makes use of my… boats?

222
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,460
Tom-san, it is terrible!

223
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,200
The boats of Franky attack the naval Court of Assizes!

224
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,730
That cannot be Franky, it is downtown in this moment.

225
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,200
I know well that it would never do that!

226
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,600
It is for that it is terrible!

227
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,159
One will stop them, Iceberg!

228
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,260
Yes.

229
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,900
Pirates or the government?!

230
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,199
Quickly!

231
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,730
Hide downtown!

232
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,599
You move away from the port!

233
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Father is still in the ship!

234
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,660
Fact of shitting, I will never forgive them!

235
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,800
Brothel! Who dared to make use of my boats?!

236
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Your honor, quickly, the ship does not have any more as a a long time!

237
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,800
Who are they? Which is this flag?

238
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,599
The attack on the naval Court of Assizes is completed.

239
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,660
It is well, now pass
at the second part of the plan.

240
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,799
This sacrifice must be made for justice.

241
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,460
Yes.

242
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Now, let us leave room to the lawsuit…

243
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,860
Tom' S workers.

244
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,059
The naval Court of Assizes ran.

245
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,460
Well, let us turn over to the discharge.

246
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,330
Of agreement.

247
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,060
They make half-turn!

248
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,930
Wait a little, I already saw these boats!

249
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,660
Tom-san, the boats return by here!

250
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,600
They are close to the coast, one can catch them!

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,930
They have foutu one crowned brothel!

252
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,800
There are two people who come from the discharge!

253
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,460
It is Tom.

254
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,930
Well, leave the boats.

255
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,860
How that?!

256
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,929
There is nobody here.

257
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,730
It is similar here also, it does not have nobody there.

258
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,460
Nmaa what that means?!

259
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,860
Still of Battle Franky?

260
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,060
Iceberg, Attention!

261
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,000
Shit, my Battle Franky are destroyed!

262
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,730
Iceberg, Tom-san!

263
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,060
Hey, you two!

264
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,659
What occurred?

265
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,200
It is what all that?

266
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,930
You are well?

267
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,730
Hein? Iceb…

268
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,460
Idiot!

269
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,060
This spy of the government which fouinait…

270
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,060
used your boats against us!

271
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,660
These are the boats which did that to you?

272
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,930
I said it to you.

273
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,000
I do not know how much time,

274
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,330
I do not understand that you can
to keep this kind of boats!

275
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,260
They are your weapons and you of it are the person in charge, Bakanky!

276
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,060
My boats did that in Tom-san.

277
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,130
Listen,

278
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,659
our capacities enable us to create
terrible weapons in this world

279
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,060
and even if we do not want it…

280
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,400
a weapon can be used to wound no matter whom…

281
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,260
even the people who are expensive to us.

282
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,930
The government handled us…

283
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,860
they will make us carry
responsibility for this attack.

284
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,730
They want the plan then… they go
to treat Tom-san like a criminal.

285
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,860
With all that! Can one still protest his innocence?!

286
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,330
So because of that Tom-san is made stop…

287
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,210
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE IT TO YOU! FRANKY!

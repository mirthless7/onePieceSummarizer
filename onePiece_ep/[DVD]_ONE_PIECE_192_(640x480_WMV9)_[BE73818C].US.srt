1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,710
With the Divine Sanctuary, Luffy and Nami are finally unable to reach the Arch.

2
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,529
It is too distant
top of bean.

3
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,239
What can we make?

4
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,320
How could one reach it?

5
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,840
There must be a means!

6
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,590
During this time, Eneru finishes
by finding the Gold Bell.

7
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,720
Then here.

8
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,890
Splendid!

9
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,359
Here what made the pride
large city of Shandora…

10
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,810
The Large Belfry!

11
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,859
After having found a plan,

12
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,320
Nami sends a message
in Usopp and the others.

13
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,719
Hein?

14
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,740
There is something of writing above.

15
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,070
Cut down giant bean…

16
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,600
towards the West.

17
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,530
But the ultimate attack of Eneru
is already above them.

18
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,489
All my objectives were achieved!

19
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,120
All that it remains…

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,529
it is to use this Raigou for
to destroy this country and the impérionimbus…

21
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,690
then to leave for Fairy Vearth.

22
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,370
Reject

23
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,450
NOW TOMB, GIANT JACK!

24
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,319
It is reversed!

25
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
Assemble Luffy!

26
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,130
Give all that you ace!

27
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,040
OK!

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,089
To try like that to reach me…

29
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,889
is of a stupidity without equal!

30
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,850
You will include/understand your silly thing.

31
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,220
MAMARAGAN

32
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:17,890
Miracle with the country of god!
 Song of love heard by the angels!

33
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,020
Upper yard…

34
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,730
disaggregates.

35
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,499
Luffy!!

36
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Nami!!

37
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,450
One would say…

38
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,149
that he does not only want
you it keys again!

39
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,800
How if that could stop me!

40
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,880
The ruins are discovered!

41
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,710
It for destroying the ground.

42
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,149
But Wiper is over there.

43
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,760
And Zoro too!

44
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,780
Brothel!

45
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,730
Ruins…

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,410
Ca will not go, Eneru!

47
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,990
The city will not be inclined
never in front of you!

48
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,090
Wiper!

49
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,729
The city of Shandora…

50
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,840
was the fatherland of one
race of proud warriors.

51
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,050
And this city preserved its history of all its forces, where that it is!

52
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,399
This fantastic capacity…

53
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,200
will never bend in front of you!

54
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,890
It does not matter the number of
forests which you will burn…

55
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,860
It does not matter the number of
ruins which you will destroy…

56
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,360
THIS GROUND SE WILL NEVER SUBJECT!!

57
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,219
Cours Wiper!

58
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,089
They is too dangerous!

59
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,859
Wiper will die!

60
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,850
Let to me go there, idiot!

61
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,320
I still hear them
small simpletons jacasser.

62
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,809
Vearth…

63
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,590
of course!

64
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,850
She did not fall!

65
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,510
Upper Yard is always there!

66
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,240
Which power…

67
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,129
Of course!

68
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,460
Vearth is powerful!

69
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,120
Which stupidity that of
to fight for Vearth!

70
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,179
We made run such an amount of blood…

71
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,990
and lost so many lives!

72
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,430
Why nobody of
is seen in 400 years?!

73
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,040
Wiper!

74
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,780
Wiper!

75
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,619
Neck… will run!

76
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,079
The bean falls!

77
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,790
He, leave from there!

78
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,310
Go!

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,750
GO!!

80
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,910
STRAW HAT!

81
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,530
I arrive, Eneru!

82
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,349
They do not include/understand anything.

83
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,770
Return the Gold Bell!!

84
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,329
It is too much, mortals!

85
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,649
I lost patience!

86
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,010
It is sufficiently large.

87
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,470
Now disappear
with this ashamed island!

88
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,430
RAIGOU

89
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,990
Nami, thank you.

90
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,070
Hein?!

91
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,290
I promise to you that it
will not be for nothing!

92
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,870
Wait, Luffy!

93
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,590
The arch is over there!

94
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,039
Luffy!

95
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,340
Do not go in it!

96
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,510
Drafts and
the lightning could kill you!

97
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,390
What hope you to make against
this insurmountable power?

98
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,450
Man rubber!

99
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:57,970
Gomu Gomu No Hanabi

100
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:57,970
[Note:Hanabi = Fireworks]

101
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
[Note:Ougon botan = gold Peony]

102
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,420
You and your lightning!

103
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,780
We made all this way
to the celestial island…

104
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,260
and you and you arrive yourself ruins the weather!

105
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,050
Dirtiness of the lightning!

106
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,170
Q-that are thus these
electric shocks?

107
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,610
It is true!

108
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,400
Gold on its arm
conduit electricity!

109
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,529
And then?

110
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,850
I will drop it right front
that you donot can destabilize it!

111
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,400
It is the end!

112
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,459
McKinley captain!

113
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,829
Stop please!

114
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,290
It is the country of God!

115
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,849
Ca does not have any direction!

116
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,659
It does not matter!

117
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,079
Us, the human ones, who were create in the abyssal zone of the life and dead…

118
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,130
There is not only we can make!

119
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,729
We gave up our
country and selected of living.

120
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,370
We do not have nowhere where to go.

121
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,939
To request…

122
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,040
it is all that remains us.

123
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,310
Song of the island.

124
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,239
When it resounds of
new in our ears,

125
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,550
the war will have ended.

126
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,550
Let us Somme us…

127
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,780
all condemned?

128
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,490
If I had courage
to hold head in Eneru,

129
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,400
all would that have been saved to them?

130
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,240
He, Suu.

131
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,840
Does God really exist?

132
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,999
If it is the case,

133
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,260
would it save us?

134
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,430
Please, if you exist…

135
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,180
protect these good people, God!

136
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,140
Please, made a miracle!

137
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,779
Protect this ground…

138
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,420
God!

139
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,640
RELEASE THE SKY!

140
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,080
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

141
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,300
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

142
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,440
RELEASE THE SKY!

143
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,450
The mass of clouds of flashes disappeared!

144
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,810
But what did it occur?

145
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,799
OOOOH!!!

146
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,489
Luffy!

147
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,349
OOOH!

148
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,960
Oh! Oh! OOOHH!!!

149
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,499
MAKE IT SOUND, STRAW HAT!

150
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,689
RELIGHT THE FLAME OF SHANDORA!

151
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,679
Go, Luffy!

152
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,410
Let hear it to me…

153
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,970
Song of the island!

154
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,979
You dared to destroy my Raigou!

155
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,010
Monkey of the Blue Sea!

156
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,199
With more!

157
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,189
I will sound you at the same time!

158
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,590
Mortal insolate!

159
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,990
200.000.000 VOLTS

160
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,460
[Note:Amaru = Flash of the paradise]

161
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,939
It is what that?

162
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,599
To sound what?!

163
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,790
The Gold Bell?!

164
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,630
When it sounds again,
that will mark the end of the war!

165
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,690
Try you to realize
this prophecy?!

166
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,960
I am God!

167
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,100
You perhaps became extremely
thanks to the gifts of the paramecia…

168
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:39,220
but you will not exceed
never the force of my logia!

169
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,090
Ca does not go on me!

170
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,610
Stop taking to you for a god!

171
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,830
Which god would test of all
to destroy on its passage?!

172
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,389
Oh?

173
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,760
You skilfully managed to avoid
to be impaled by seizing my three-pronged fork.

174
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,290
Luffy!

175
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,209
What will you make, man rubber?

176
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,230
You cannot flee nowhere!

177
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,030
Your own arm you
conduit towards my three-pronged fork!

178
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,270
And if you try to flee,
you tombs in the vacuum!

179
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,610
I am impressed that
you would have arrived until there,

180
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,579
but you will not go further!

181
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,240
Neither you, nor this ground!

182
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,740
I will form another Raigou!

183
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,680
It is the duty of our people!

184
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,240
I am so sorry!

185
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,460
Luffy…

186
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,120
The celestial island
really will be destroyed?

187
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,240
Thus you chose to fall!

188
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,200
Luffy!

189
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,790
Nami, moves from there!

190
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,750
What?!

191
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,769
Do not underestimate me
not, lobes of ears!

192
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,840
Gomu Gomu No Rocket

193
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,070
Gomu Gomu No…

194
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,730
Still this attack?

195
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,440
Until the Bell sounds!

196
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,909
This time I will impale you!

197
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,940
[Note:Ougon Files = gold Rafale]

198
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,090
Too much fast!

199
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,840
When you return in Jaya…

200
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,680
What you will think when
you will see us parties?

201
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,610
Wait still a little.

202
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,720
I you will make it hear soon!

203
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,170
“We are there!”

204
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,410
LET US RELIGHT THE FLAME OF SHANDORA!

205
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,539
The War of the Sky started…

206
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,410
400 years ago…

207
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,670
to see this moment to arrive.

208
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,969
Yes…

209
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,940
Crowned Earth…

210
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,240
will sing again.

211
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,470
One day, undoubtedly.

212
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,780
Six years ago,

213
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,280
on the island of Jaya on Large
Line, I saw the Gold City!

214
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,070
The Gold City exists!

215
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,459
Never nobody succeeded in proving…

216
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,750
that the celestial island and
Cité d'Or did not exist.

217
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,399
It is that the adventure!

218
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,970
LET them HEAR It!

219
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,370
Papi?

220
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,750
You hear it?

221
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,230
The Gold City is there!

222
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,640
Since 400 years…

223
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,100
the Gold City…

224
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,910
WAS IN THE SKY!!

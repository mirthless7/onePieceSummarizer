1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,070
One Piece Treasure Sweepstakes!
The first letter is...

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,260
The way to win will be
explained at the end of the show!

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,920
Luffy and the others
arrived at Enies Lobby.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,240
We have from the Main Gate
to the Gate of Justice,

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,720
to get Nico Robin and
Franky back, or we lose.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,380
Why's that? Wherever Robin is taken away, we
just have to follow after her until we succeed!

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,110
I told you before we
left Water 7, didn't I?

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,840
If we pass that gate, our destination will either be
the Marines' Headquarters or the Great Submarine Prison!

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,380
No matter what, we must
settle things before that.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,800
That's how it is.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,220
But still, even if we
all get on the island,

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,660
the ones who really stand a chance
to win against the CP9 are...

13
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,250
Just you guys!

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,620
I came to understand your strength
while travelling on this train with you.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:07,000
That's why you should wait here for five minutes and
then bash into the Main Island with the Rocketman!

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,630
We'll go fight first and open a passage so that the train
can pass between the Main Gate and the Main Island Gate.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
After that, we want you to go
on, no matter how many of us fall.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,290
We only have around sixty members, but the other side
should have around two or three thousand soldiers.

19
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,550
You Straw Hats should try to avoid unnecessary
battles and concentrate on just following the CP9.

20
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,840
Yeah, I got it!

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,650
Hey guys, this is the
front of the island!

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,600
Look well at the sky behind Enies Lobby.

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,050
That is the Gate of Justice!

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,700
SO HUGE!!

25
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,400
Saa! There is no time to hesitate!

26
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,580
Then we'll infiltrate the
island according to the plan!

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,780
Let us cover you!

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,560
Oi!! Aren't those two with us?

29
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,030
Luffy burning with desire
to get Robin back...

30
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,260
Hey, where's Luffy?

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,870
Eh? He was here until just now...

32
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,960
Hey, it's Straw Hat-san!

33
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,090
What the hell is he
doing all by himself!?

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,320
That guy doesn't
understand the plan at all!

35
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,760
It didn't serve any purpose...

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
He said he understood, right?

37
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,580
Waiting five minutes
is impossible for him.

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,120
I guess so.

39
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,360
...sneaked in to Enies Lobby alone.

40
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,450
On the other side, Chief
Spandam is leading the CP9...

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,750
And then...

42
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,480
This is the wonderful day when the eight
members of the CP9, including myself,

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,110
will finally be
gathered together, but...

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,990
What's the meaning of this article!?

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,150
In our new plan to assassinate
the leader of the revolution,

46
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,470
the orders were to take out three people
and your mission would have been over...

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,950
But you just had to kill
twenty three people, right!?

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,160
If you have excuses, try them!

49
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,540
Yoyoi!!

50
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,550
I make all my apologies, chief!

51
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,740
In the commanding center of Enies
Lobby, the Judiciary Tower...

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,250
Everything is my...

53
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,280
Spandam was awaiting the arrival of Lucci and
the others, with the rest of the CP9 members.

54
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Responsibility!

55
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,810
Stop that, Kumadori!

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,500
A man shouldn't lower
his head so easily!

57
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,270
I'll explain everything
to the chief, so sit down!

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,190
I can't die!

59
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,040
Hurry up and commit
suicide! You bastard!

60
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,140
We'll be in trouble if he dies, chapapa!

61
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,660
It's okay, I understood!

62
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,990
Forget it, guys...

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,350
Acha!! I spilt my coffee! Shit!!

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,160
And I heard Nero wasn't of any use!

65
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,100
Mah, it's okay...

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,550
What's up with this place?

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,140
There's such a huge hole! It
looks like the island is floating!

68
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,880
There's a town, too. Robin...

69
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,180
I wonder if she's in there.

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,100
There's someone up there!
Shoot him down immediately!

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,080
Ah, I've been spotted!

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,180
He passed the gate!

73
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,030
And Luffy, who already
passed the Main Gate...

74
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,140
This is the Main Gate!
This is the Main Gate!

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,320
This is a message for the chief
officer on the Main Island!

76
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,100
What do you want? What's happening?

77
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,680
There's an intruder who passed the Main
Gate and is heading towards the Main Island!

78
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,500
What? Surely you can at least
take care of just one intruder.

79
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,920
But, that...!

80
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,940
This is the Main Island Gate!

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,850
We confirm the presence of an intruder.

82
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,770
...continues rushing the same way,
heading to the Main Island Gate.

83
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,180
Hey there little guy, stop running.

84
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,560
Don't you know where you are?

85
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,440
Please be careful when dealing with him!

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,830
If my eyes serve me
right, this man could be...

87
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,470
Straw Hat Luffy!

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,390
What!? What did you just say!?

89
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,610
I think he's the man
with a 100 million bounty!

90
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,780
The Straw Hat pirate!!

91
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,190
Robin...

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,690
Where is Robin!?

93
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,920
This is an extremely urgent
report from the Main Gate!

94
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,310
What is it this time!?

95
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,270
A group of intruders passed the
front barrier riding monsters!

96
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,240
We need reinforcements!

97
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,750
Reinforcements...

98
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,270
Don't waste a moment, let's go!

99
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,190
What's up!? Gatekeepers, answer!

100
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,340
What's happening!?

101
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
What is it, Nico Robin?

102
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,890
Don't stop.

103
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,280
Guys, are you prepared?

104
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,910
What about your wounds?

105
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,470
I'm okay. It's because...

106
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,060
I'm Sogekiiing
-!

107
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,000
Seatrain Rocketman!

108
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,530
Only four minutes left and...

109
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,340
We'll assault them!

110
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,950
I'm really sorry, but...

111
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,740
Could you let me pass, please?

112
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,590
Even if you ask politely...

113
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,040
When I say no, I mean...

114
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,420
No!!

115
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,290
Understood!

116
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,230
Then...

117
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,260
Get ready!

118
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,030
Damn you pirate!

119
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,410
Oh, that's dirty!

120
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
He got his arms!

121
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,270
Such a childish trick!

122
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,810
Don't falter!

123
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,790
Ah! Sorry!

124
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,480
Ah!! I'm so sorry! Sempai!

125
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,420
Stop fooling around!

126
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,860
Your back is completely open!

127
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,810
That guy...

128
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,140
Stop him!

129
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,320
It's only one mere human!

130
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,660
What's this? His body seems so light!

131
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,910
I'll hurry in first.

132
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,290
Let's meet again!

133
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,170
See ya!

134
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,060
Wait!

135
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,660
He went inside! Hurry up and follow him!

136
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,630
He entered the Main Island!

137
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,500
Contact the chief!

138
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,080
Message from the Main
Island Gate to the chief!

139
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,240
Straw Hat Luffy
intruded the Main Island!

140
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,670
What!? You let an intruder
enter the Main Island?

141
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,850
What the hell is happening!?

142
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,810
What about Oimo and Kaashii?
Did those two get beaten too?

143
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,400
No, it should be night
time in their country, so...

144
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,080
They must be asleep...

145
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,250
Is this the time to sleep!?
Smack them awake now!

146
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,310
Do the same to the soldiers
sleeping on the Main Island!

147
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,510
Yes!

148
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,710
Is it alright for you to scream this
much for a mere intruder, director?

149
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,950
We are here...

150
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,860
Don't be stupid!

151
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,630
As the entrance of the World Government,
the Judiciary Island wears its sacred crest!

152
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,940
Any idiot is supposed to at least understand
what it means to invade this place!

153
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,920
That guy went all the way to the Main
Island just to get one nakama back!

154
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,380
Acha!

155
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,510
Acha! Looking down on us!

156
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,770
The Straw Hat crew and
their damn subordinates...

157
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,420
Gatekeepers! Tell me about
the situation at the Main Gate!

158
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,140
Oi, gatekeepers!

159
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,780
How many enemies are there!?

160
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,220
Where are they now!?

161
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,010
Answer, Main Gate!

162
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:08,930
Oi, what's wrong!?

163
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,810
Eheh! As if I'd waste bullets for this!

164
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,230
Try entering this door! Open the gates!

165
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,640
Don't let them open it!

166
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,700
You're in the way!

167
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,700
Mozu, go left!

168
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,940
Understood!

169
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
I won't let you pass!

170
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,400
A hair came from my nose!

171
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,960
You shouldn't get distracted!

172
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,240
Hurry up!

173
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,600
I owe you one!

174
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,690
Not done yet!?

175
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,080
Mozu! Kiwi!

176
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,480
This keyhole won't last long against
a member of the Franky Family!

177
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,930
It's done!

178
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,560
Here too!

179
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,030
Yosh! It's time to open the gates!

180
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,670
Kairiki Destroyers!

181
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,020
Don't let them through! Shit!

182
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,370
Scram! You're in the way!

183
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,250
Let's break through!

184
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,760
We breached the first
one, the Main Gate!

185
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,730
Oooh! What's this hole!?

186
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,670
We don't have time, don't look down!

187
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,300
Move forward!

188
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,530
Continue running to the Main Island!

189
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,380
It's a waterfall!

190
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,550
Yatta!

191
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,010
Hey guys, this way!

192
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,890
Hurry up and lend a hand!

193
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,340
Kaashii-san!
Oimo-san!

194
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,110
Please wake up quickly!

195
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,990
The Main Gate was
opened by the intruders!

196
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,010
He said that the Main Gate was opened...

197
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,230
Oimo.

198
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,620
We can't just let that go.

199
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,180
Kaashii...

200
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,550
It's hard since we just woke up...

201
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,870
We have work to do. Let's go...

202
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,560
Here!

203
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,470
I still haven't gotten enough sleep...

204
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,850
Let's take care of them
quickly and get back to sleep.

205
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
Oimo!

206
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,850

G-Gi-Giants!

207
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,440
I don't know what you
guys came here for...

208
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,780
But you should go back home
before you get squashed!

209
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,300
Right, Oimo?

210
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,010
Yeah, Kaashii. I think so too.

211
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,630
Let's squash their bones flat...

212
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,210
Having giants as
gatekeepers... That's not fair!

213
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,820
So big! The Kairiki Destroyers
look tiny in front of them!

214
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Saa, go home!

215
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,260
I won't let you pass through this gate.

216
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,070
Oimo!

217
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,400
They're coming!

218
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,790
No matter who the enemy
is, we musn't falter!

219
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,700
Franky Family!

220
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,690
If it's for aniki!

221
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,780
Oi, you understand that?

222
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:41,720
Yeah...

223
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,890
Yosh!

224
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,560
Only us three can do it!

225
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,460
Even those giants can't resist the superhuman
strength we got from dismantling ships!

226
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,260
Destroyers!

227
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,760
The three Kairiki Destroyers were...!

228
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,490
They got done in an instant!

229
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,830
We were born fighters!

230
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,600
Compared with tiny humans slightly larger than normal,
the blood that flows through our veins is way different.

231
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,530
I won't let any of you pass through!

232
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,090
Oimo!

233
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,280
Don't be afraid! Don't
let your morale decrease!

234
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,330
That's right! Our aniki
Franky is behind those doors!

235
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,100
Fight so we won't put shame
over aniki's name! Franky Family!

236
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,310
Two minutes left, huh?

237
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Oi! Straw Hat Luffy!

238
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,180
How many nakama did you bring with you?

239
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,170
Enies Lobby has over
ten thousand soldiers!

240
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,290
Yeah. I'm alone.

241
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,460
Open the way!

242
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,510
I won't let even one
of you pass this gate!

243
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,530
Let's follow Straw Hat-san!!

244
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,290
Next time, One Piece: Battle with
the Giants! Open the Second Door!

245
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

246
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,240
Here's how you can get your present!

247
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,670
Write the four letters that appeared in the
show, your address, your full name, your age,

248
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,240
your opinion of the show and
you may win a lot of prizes!

249
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,360
The last keyword is... this!

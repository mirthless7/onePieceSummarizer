1
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,199
So tough...

2
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,883
"I'm Luffy! The man who will become the Pirate King!"

3
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:32,616
"Ore wa Luffy! Kaizoku-ou ni naru Otoko da!"

4
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,617
<i>(Based on Manga ch.2: "They
Call Him Straw-Hat Luffy")</i>

5
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,526
Don't worry about it...

6
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:46,261
The whirlpool won't do
any damage to this ship.

7
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,282
Miss!

8
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,029
Can I dance with you?

9
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,112
Not again!

10
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:02,780
You missed!

11
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:06,241
You said you missed?

12
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,844
Eh? Huh?

13
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,199
It's so heavy...

14
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,603
It's got wine inside! I guess...

15
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,465
We got it!

16
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,551
There is a ship behind us!

17
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,653
With a pirate mark on it!

18
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,055
It's a pirate ship!

19
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,152
Enemy coming!

20
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,540
Captain! A pirate ship!

21
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,322
What?

22
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:09,046
Stay calm, everybody!

23
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:12,905
Stay calm! Follow your orders!

24
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:19,283
Attack!

25
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,203
Koby!

26
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:33,437
Yes!

27
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:37,041
Who is the most beautiful
person on the sea?

28
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:42,243
The captain of the ship...
it's you, Miss Alvida!

29
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,320
Good answer...

30
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:50,855
Thank you.

31
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:54,392
Miss Alvida! We got a
good quarry this time.

32
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,893
That's right...

33
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,895
Let's board!

34
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:00,821
Aye!

35
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,537
I'll show those busters how good I am!

36
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:44,068
For I'm Iron-Mace Alvida!

37
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:56,554
Koby! What are you doing?

38
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:59,219
I'm scared...

39
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:03,094
You dare to disobey my order?

40
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:07,022
Please don't hurt me...

41
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,157
Then go! Right away!

42
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,756
It hurts...

43
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:21,503
Fear me!

44
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,224
We won't kill you,

45
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,826
but you must turn over
everything valuable!

46
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:41,187
We'll throw anyone to
the sea who try to resist!

47
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,475
Hello there...

48
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,047
Seems like no one's here.

49
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,507
That's good...

50
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,145
What a big barrel...

51
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,926
Who are you? I've never seen you before!

52
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,519
Hey kid!

53
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,389
Slacking off again, are you?

54
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,426
No, no! I'm trying to move it!

55
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:45,896
Okay! Let's make it lighter!

56
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,231
Yes! I'm thirsty!

57
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:48,232
How can we do that?

58
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,768
If Miss Alvida finds
out, she will kill us!

59
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,237
You can keep your mouth shut...

60
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,573
...can you, Koby?

61
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,709
I... I... yes!

62
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,277
It's really heavy.

63
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,679
I can't wait!

64
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,039
Shut up! I'll open it now!

65
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,819
Yeah!

66
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:29,898
Nice nap!

67
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,709
What the...

68
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:39,450
Who are you?

69
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,318
We ask the same question!

70
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,587
He'll catch cold sleeping there.

71
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:46,286
It's your fault!

72
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:51,896
Don't you know we're pirates?
We act this way! Well?

73
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,964
I'm hungry! Got any food?

74
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,251
Listen to me!

75
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,056
You runt!

76
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,002
Go to hell!

77
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,961
What're you doing?

78
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,763
Who are you?

79
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:26,997
Me?

80
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:31,025
I'm Monkey D. Luffy, at you service!

81
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,811
What? What happened?

82
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,947
What's the matter with him?

83
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,315
Run! Quickly!

84
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:47,151
If they find you here, you'll die!

85
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:49,587
But I'm hungry.

86
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,490
You're in mortal danger!

87
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,759
They got a gang on the deck!

88
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,927
Oh yeah?

89
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,797
Come with me.

90
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:03,292
Not there!

91
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,603
That hurts!

92
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,740
Oh!

93
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,041
Food! Food!

94
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,942
It's great!

95
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:16,313
The most dangerous place
might be the most safest.

96
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:18,082
What should I eat first?

97
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,884
That box! Yes! That's right!

98
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,552
Looks good!

99
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:26,123
I'm Koby! You're Luffy, aren't you?

100
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:29,627
You're good! How did you do it?

101
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,155
This is good!

102
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,131
Isn't this a pirate ship?

103
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,667
No, it isn't.

104
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:41,338
This ship was hijacked by Miss Alvida.

105
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,107
So what?

106
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,476
Is there a boat on this ship?

107
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,978
I think so.

108
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,314
My boat got swallowed up.

109
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,851
Oh? That whirlpool? You survived it?

110
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,859
Yes! I was shocked, If
you can believe that!

111
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,682
Are you a companion of those pirates?

112
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:09,934
It's the most miserable
day of my life...

113
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:16,103
I was on my way fishing,
taking a boat offshore...

114
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,735
Huh?

115
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:27,117
<i>And somehow, I boarded a pirate ship!</i>

116
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:28,953
The next year,

117
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:33,490
They didn't kill me
they kept me as a slave.

118
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,759
You're not only stupid,
you're also an idiot!

119
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,661
Don't say it like that.

120
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,964
Why didn't you run away?

121
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,865
It's impossible! No way!

122
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:44,068
If I were caught, what will happen?

123
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,203
I'm so afraid to think of that!

124
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:48,539
You're a wuss!

125
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,057
You make me sick!

126
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:55,646
Hey! Don't just stand there!

127
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:59,249
Move all of those before
the navy gets here!

128
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,553
Or you can have the
taste of my Iron Mace!

129
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:05,456
A good haul! so much
fortune on this ship!

130
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:08,225
<i>Don't fool around! beware
of Miss Alvida's Iron Mace!</i>

131
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,493
<i>It would be painful!</i>

132
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:12,757
<i>Nobody can take that!</i>

133
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,292
Miss Alvida!

134
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,868
Yes?

135
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,003
Something came up!

136
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,971
What do you mean?

137
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,773
The barrel...

138
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,869
There is a monster!

139
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,944
What did you say?

140
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:41,358
Not you! We mean there
is a monster in the barrel!

141
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,928
Maybe a bounty hunter!

142
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:45,994
What?

143
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:02,777
I think you're right...

144
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:09,053
I wish I have the courage
to drift in a barrel.

145
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:13,057
I would like to do something.

146
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:13,857
By the way...

147
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:18,195
Luffy, why are you traveling?

148
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,764
I want to be the King of Pirates!

149
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,728
Oh!

150
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,835
The King of Pirates? Yeah!

151
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,270
Is it true?

152
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,004
Of course!

153
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,873
Luffy, are you a pirate too?

154
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:30,808
Yes!

155
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,809
How about your companion?

156
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,736
No one! I'm trying to find someone.

157
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,585
The King of Pirates...

158
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:44,621
...has control of the whole world!

159
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:48,492
It also means a treasure
of fortune, fame and power!

160
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:51,395
The lucky person with the "One Piece"!

161
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:52,730
Oh! "Oh"? What "oh"?

162
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,066
All the pirates are
looking for that treasure!

163
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,401
That's my goal, too!

164
00:13:57,402 --> 00:14:01,004
No way! No way! Absolutely No way!

165
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:04,708
How can it be possible for
you to stand on the top?

166
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,872
No way! No way!

167
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,280
Why did you do that?

168
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,416
I wanted to do it, no reason!

169
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,809
Forget it; I'm used to it.

170
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,592
I don't care if it's possible or not...

171
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:24,826
I want to be the King of Pirates.

172
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:29,466
I've made up my mind

173
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:34,133
If I should fight 'till
I die! It doesn't matter!

174
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,943
Ok! I'm full! I should
try to find a boat.

175
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:41,612
<i>Can I have a boat if I sack them?</i>

176
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,681
<i>Hope they're not so stingy!</i>

177
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:48,540
I never thought of it that way...

178
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:51,855
I can do it too!

179
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,557
<i>With the courage If I should die...</i>

180
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:55,058
What are you talking about?

181
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:59,696
Can I join the navy too?

182
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:00,697
Navy?

183
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:04,668
That's right! To catch some bad guys!

184
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:08,739
The dream I had since I
was a kid! Can I do it?

185
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,940
How should I know?

186
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,341
Yes!I should try it!

187
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,645
Being a slave like this,
it's better to run away!

188
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,746
Catching Miss Alvida!

189
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:19,605
No! I want to catch her...

190
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:30,127
Who do you want to catch with him?

191
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:33,691
Tell me! Koby!

192
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:54,551
He isn't the "bounty
hunter", I think! "Zoro"!

193
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:55,419
"Zoro"?

194
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,287
Koby!

195
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:02,682
Who is the most beautiful
person on the sea?

196
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:05,062
Of course! That is..

197
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:08,227
Who is the ugly and old fat woman?

198
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:16,398
Ugly and old? What is he talking about?

199
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:21,443
Damn you!

200
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,180
Let's go!

201
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,715
Damn it!

202
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,628
Oh, there!

203
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,472
Attack someone from
behind, that's dirty!

204
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:11,027
Kick around with many, that's dirty!

205
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,370
Get a load of this!

206
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,837
GOMU GOMU NO!

207
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:32,812
ROCKET!

208
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,893
What?

209
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,560
Luffy! What are you?

210
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,127
Me? I'm the rubber man!

211
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,060
Rubber man? What's that?

212
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,030
You've eaten the "devil
fruit", haven't you?

213
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,143
That's right! I've
eaten the Rubber Fruit!

214
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,712
You did?

215
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,014
I heard that before...

216
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:07,351
I never thought that
"devil fruit" really exists.

217
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:11,388
<i>You got a good hand
wanna gain the prize?</i>

218
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:12,589
I'm a pirate!

219
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,924
Pirate?

220
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,826
<i>You? All by yourself?</i>

221
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:17,427
Yes! I'm alone for now...

222
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:19,429
<i>I'll have a companion sooner or later...</i>

223
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,129
<i>...at least 10, I guess!</i>

224
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,737
Is it true? You're a pirate too?

225
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:31,309
A competitor of mine, eh?

226
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,777
Luffy! Run away now!

227
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:34,544
Huh?

228
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,780
Didn't you see the size of her mace?

229
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:40,378
The most powerful one on the sea!

230
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:45,722
I've made up my mind to
be the King of Pirates.

231
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,989
If I should fight 'till
I die! It doesn't matter!

232
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,624
What do you call me?

233
00:18:57,521 --> 00:19:03,266
The most.. ugly, old fat woman!

234
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,465
What did you just say?

235
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,158
I want to join the navy!

236
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,027
Then, I'll catch bad guys!

237
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:26,596
Don't you know what
you're talking about?

238
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:30,267
Yes I do! I want to do it!

239
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,569
I want to join the navy! Join the navy!

240
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,238
Then I'll catch you!

241
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:37,330
You've just dug your grave!

242
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,476
I'm not sorry! I'm not!

243
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:42,049
You heard me! I'm fighting for my dream!

244
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,972
Nicely put, Koby!

245
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,127
It's no use.

246
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:58,028
What?

247
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,494
I'm a rubber man!

248
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,465
GOMU GOMU NO!

249
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:12,333
PISTOLET!

250
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:35,094
The sky is so blue...

251
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,978
Hey! Aye!

252
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,413
Give Koby a boat...

253
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,949
...he wants to join the navy!

254
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,917
Let him go right away!

255
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,411
Aye aye!

256
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,086
Luffy-san!

257
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,958
That is... the navy!

258
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,601
And it's the right time! Go ahead now!

259
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:14,504
I'm a pirate! It's
better to slip away now!

260
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,405
Knock it off!

261
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:18,789
It's not my day! It would
be unlucky if I was caught!

262
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,198
We got away finally.

263
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,295
Yeah! That's fun!

264
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,967
Hey, Luffy...

265
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:46,904
Yeah?

266
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,939
To find the"One Piece"...

267
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,109
You must go through the "Grand Line"...

268
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,412
They called it "The Pirate's Graveyard".

269
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,805
Right! So I must find a good man...

270
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,919
Who's that guy? The bounty hunter?

271
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,754
You mean"Zoro"?

272
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:08,225
I heard that he was caught by the navy.

273
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,060
What? That bad?

274
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,394
It's not like that!

275
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:16,095
He is truly a devil!

276
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,236
Why do you ask?

277
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,539
If he is so good, I want
him to be my companion!

278
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,076
Huh? You're thinking
the wrong way again!

279
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:27,844
Maybe he is a good man...

280
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,080
Bad guys would be caught!

281
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,751
No way! no way! Absolutely no way!

282
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,853
Why did you do that?

283
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,945
I wanted to do it, no reason!

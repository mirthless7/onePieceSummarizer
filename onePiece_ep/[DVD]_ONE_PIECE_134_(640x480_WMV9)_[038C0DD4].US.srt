The sea is a mysterious endroi.

27

Hey, I saw an island.

28
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,020

Something does not go?!

30
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,290
No, nothing.

31
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,380

32
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,380

33
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,500

It is small like city, but it is well animated!

44
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,880
I bet that one could supply oneself here.

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,350
You will buy some Ussop things?

46
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,060

Ca makes well a long time that I did not see fires of artifices!

56
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,540

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,820

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,210
Summers you come for the fireworks?

65
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,980
Not, not exactly.

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,800
Why?

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,370
Are your fireworks also popular?

68
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,240
Yes.

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,410
Our island is famous for its festival.

70
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,800
It has become an annual event for 400 years.

71
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,060
400 years?!

72
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,530
That made so a long time!

73
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,270
Look at.

74
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,930
You see the tower on this mountain over there?

75
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,400
Since 400 years.

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,040
. .cette house created fireworks, 
from generation to generation.

77
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,740
In this moment, it is only one hurdy-gurdy 
man and a little girl who live there.

78
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,840
Therefore, the hurdy-gurdy man only manufactures all the fireworks with him?

79
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,460
Not, not.

80
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,160
This little girl also assistance to do them.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,200
They work all the year without slackening only for this night.

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,340
It is really admirable.

83
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,040
Why that take a whole year to manufacture fires of artifices?

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,100
Be to you that an idiot! It is because of.

85
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,790
Many things.

86
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,620
Even if I explain to you you nothing goes measuring rod.

87
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,590

88
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,840

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,350
I have almost more gunpowders!

90
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,280
Can be if I go over there, they will be able to give some to me a little.

91
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,220
wait.

92
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,270
I will return later!

93
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,730
But….

94
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,970
I hope that will not pass like last year.

95
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,950
Yes. Me too.

96
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,940
What is what occurred last year.?

97
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,640
Oh, during the last festival.

98
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,080
Hey! They traversed all this way to have fun.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,990
Pas la pains of their wasting the pleasure of it.

100
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,730
You are right.

101
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,130
Afflicted, it is nothing low register.

102
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,970
Forget all that I said.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,790
In this case.

104
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,920
We must turn over to warn Zorro and Robin!

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,820
Yo!

106
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,770
I will say it to Robin-chan!

107
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,630
Wait.

108
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,990
I cross which one must dabord eat.

109
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,220
Why that!!

110
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,240
With my talent I can do one crowned fireworks.

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,510
When I show them this, they will burst.

112
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,250
“Which talent!!”

113
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,520
“Take all that you want, it is FREE!!”

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,010
I do not know if that will occur like that!

115
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,010
No chance!!

116
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,460

Immense.!!

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,480
White!!!

133
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,140
Note:The ball has a height of 8 shaku (Approximately 2.42 m)

134
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,140
For which you begin to encrust you like that 
in the houses of the others after being returned!!

135
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,240
Hey, thus say!

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,290
It is truth this trick?

137
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,780
It paper-is chewed, not?

138
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,990
That is what a craftsman of artifices foutrait with 
paper-chewed in this house?!

139
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,300
It is a truth.

140
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,810
Did Hey, you claim to have a beautiful piece of art?

141
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,090
Ah, Q. .quoi?!

142
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,160
ahh, it is nothing.

143
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,860
A Dango ball. mm?!

144
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,170
The aspect is not badly, and it is well packed.

145
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,860
Why do you hide it?

146
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,280
What a waste! You must complete it!

147
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,530
Heh, Qui' are you?

148
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,780
Me, it is Kodama.

149
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,550
The little girl of Odama-jii-san.

150
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,170
Thus small the gamine which designs fires 
of artifice with the old man it is.

151
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,410
Yes, It is me.

152
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,030
The fact that I would be a gamine is not a reason to take to me with the light one

153
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,390
I am at least as good as this old catch.

154
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,020
Ca made maaal!

155
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,840
Or is what you put the head!

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,200
I cross to have said to you to give this message to the group of the shooting?

157
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,130
I did it.

158
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,250
They said that they will pass to take them the rather possible one.
thus I thought of preparing the balloons!.

159
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,100
Y' has too many things to make before they arrive, 
how to charge the tubes with release in the coach!

160
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,990
Yes! Yes! I know!

161
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,460
I went there already!!

162
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,370
That is what are to you spirit to look at.

163
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,240
Ceases to make this head of idiot and will help it!!

164
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,230
Why!?

165
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,540
Do not ask why! move!!

166
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,750
What is what bell with this guy?

167
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,600
At the beginning he asks me to leave, just after he says to me to help it.

168
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,130
Make shit! I break!!

169
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,060
Hey!

170
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,240
You draw already.?

171
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,730
Make me a knack!

172
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,310
You are not an apprentice?

173
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,090
Of course that not.

174
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,090
I just came here to seek gunpowder.

175
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,230
By looking at this firework which you carried.

176
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,680
I believed that you were there like apprentice.

177
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,500
It was right something which I did in my temps libre.

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,080
Y' had any means which I would be a pro.

179
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,100
I was unaware of that.

180
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
But it was well done, I ensure you!

181
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,870
You must complete it the rather possible one!

182
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,660
I precisely thought of it, you already spoke me.

183
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,170
What did you want to say?

184
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,450
It is already finishes, in what relates to me.

185
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,440
The goal to make fireworks is to decorate 
night sky by pretty flowers.

186
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,210
It is there or work is completed.

187
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,260
Therefore, of the fireworks in their tubes.

188
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,210
are loins to be completed.

189
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,370
It is like these tubes of shooting.

190
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,570
They will not be complete as long as they will not have a ball inside.

191
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,190
Tu' be admirable!

192
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,890
As I already said.

193
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,630
Do not take to me slightly.

194
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,070
It is the same case for this large fireworks over there

195
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,740
It is not yet finishes either, truth?

196
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,670
I would like to undoubtedly see this trick bursting!

197
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,220
Last year.

198
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,990
We tested with something similar.

199
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,540
Did Y' have some already like that?

200
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,430
Yes.

201
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,160
But that failed.

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,470
Our equipment did not can support it.

203
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,980
But that wants to say.

204
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,330
My Dad, and my Mom.

205
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,230
This same day last year.

206
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,220
They died.

207
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,520
At the time or the 205 Ball had burst.

208
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,360
Crowned bad weather, not true?

209
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,470
Do you think of suspending the festival if that continues like that?

210
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,350
Not.

211
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,560
I cross not to be able to do it.

212
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,900
Dad, Mom.

213
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,360
Continue with the préparatives ones.

214
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,920
Ok.

215
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,490
What is what you cross not to be able to make.?

216
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,920
Listen.!

217
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,080
If the sky is cleared up with fallen the night.

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,990
I will launch the Ball-205.

219
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,300
Stop that…!

220
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,910
The fireworks it is not puffs out.!!

221
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,650
Idiot.

222
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,520
Do not howl like that.

223
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,900
D.désolé.

224
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,650
But. You cannot only burst this great trick with you.

225
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,910
Worry you!

226
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,460
I asked in secrecy for the assistance of the team of shooting.

227
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,350
But that is likely to fail again.

228
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,460
They is dangerous.!

229
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,180
It is well, I want to do it.

230
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,960
It is not well!!

231
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,790
You want to also burst the team of the shooting?

232
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,230
Of course that not.

233
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,840
When all is prét, I will ask them to be held with the shelter.

234
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,970
I will even do it me!

235
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,070
“Jvé to even do it me!”

236
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,930
Not question, not question!

237
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,350
I will say it to your grandfather to stop you.

238
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,900
It is what these idées de génie!!

239
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,790
It is what I was going to ask you!

240
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,790
Does not destroy the dream of my parents!

241
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,970
The dream of your parents?

242
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,870
Yes.

243
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,960
My family designed fireworks during all the latter 400 years.

244
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,550
I am well.

245
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,550
Cease moving!

246
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,540
In the past.

247
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,260
They had talent to design and launch the Ball-205.

248
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,410
But at a certain point.

249
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,020
they stopped this tradition.

250
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,320
Ressusciter these talents.

251
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,420
It stays the dream of my Dad and my Mom.

252
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,060
Today.

253
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,730
I will carry out their dream!

254
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
Good, you ace of cranium.

255
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,160
A.attends one minute.

256
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,670
Why you tell me all that with me?

257
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,850
You want to really know?

258
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,460
You will not say it to your grandfather?

259
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,920
No, the team of shooting soon will come to recover the ball.

260
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,020
Therefore, I need you to retain 
grandfather until they finish.

261
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,390
Please!

262
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,890
Idiot.!

263
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,890
It is as if I helped you to do something of dangerous!!

264
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,300
Dad, Mom. your dream is with half carried out.

265
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,480
I will carry it out for you.

266
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,140
Wait one minute!!

267
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,990
A prayer before the fireworks.?

268
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,420
Ca appears to me well.

269
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,880
But one will not draw that one.

270
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,940
One will use only the small balloons.

271
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,140
The team of shooting.

272
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Why? How did you know?

273
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,260
Would not be ridiculous!

274
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,260
Everyone thinks of you.

275
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,230
Why?

276
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,170
Why? I said to you how much that counts for me!!

277
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,000
Afflicted, Kodama-chan.

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,950
But they is dangerous.

279
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,990
Ca is likely to fail.

280
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,910
How can you know!

281
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,680
And even if it is risked, I am not afraid!

282
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,610
Ca is enough!!

283
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,410
It is not as if I did not include/understand the feeling to be abondonné.

284
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,430
But it is not the way of inheriting their will.

285
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,720
Kodama-chan.!

286
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,420
Ca will be perfect.

287
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,120
Good, One will continue with the préparatives ones.

288
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,980
Yes, Thank you.

289
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,190
You to continue to prepare you 
even if that continues to rain?

290
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,000
The rain goes soon arréter.

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,780
The wind blows of the east.

292
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,280
What I cannot include/understand it is Kodama.

293
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,720
Grandfather.

294
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
Does this tower, it hold here since 4 ciécles?

295
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,900
Yes.

296
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,580
Why this question?

297
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,040
I thought just of a trick.

298
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,140
You want the knowledge?

299
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,320
Hey, of the tombs?

300
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,890
It is sad, heh.

301
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,900
Yo!

302
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,310
Dad, Mom.

303
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,220
As I said.

304
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,910
If this rain arréte.

305
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,570
Will Ca want to say that you give me your agreement, Vrai?

306
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,510
To launch the Ball-205 for you.

307
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,340
But I cross.

308
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,380
I will not succeed, heh?

309
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,680
Of course that one does not want to say that you will not succeed!

310
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,230
Kodama, If you launches your fireworks,

311
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,760
One will mettera fine with this rain with joy.

312
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,640
But.

313
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,630
Your dream will not be.

314
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,730
You cross which one has only one dream?

315
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,720
Tu' be our dream

316
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,190
Our dream with us, it is that you become 
large a craftsman of the fireworks.

317
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,810
Kodama.

318
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,530
You can take your time and creates your own 205-Ball.

319
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,660
You all the time have world in front of you.

320
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,560
If you will be able one day to make a success of the Ball-205.

321
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,960
Ca will carry out also our dream.

322
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,230
Let Gran-father occupy himself some.

323
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,330
And continues to make pretty fireworks
so that we look at them paradise.

324
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,650
Ok!

325
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,840
I will do it!

326
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,390
And a day. I will create my own Ball-205!

327
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,070
Thank you to be understanding.

328
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,490
And as promised!

329
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,410
How you have. It is astonishing!

330
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,760
Who are you?

331
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,550
Me?

332
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,510
I am a messenger of the paradise.

333
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,520
Ussop Angel!

334
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,190
Ussop. Angel.

335
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,380
It is strong!

336
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,690
Ussop Angel!

337
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,770
Thank you!

338
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,790
I will do my better!

339
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,450
They is marvellous.

340
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,650
They make a true spectacle.

341
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,990
But, still a little.

342
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,260
It used the wheels of the cart of the garden.

343
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,110
to build a crank to slip the ball into the tower.

344
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,170
Therefore, this tower at 400 years.

345
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,750
was useful for launching of the Ball-205.

346
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,190
But, which is really this type?

347
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,900
Great Final!!

348
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
Large spectacle, heh?

349
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,210
Yes. It is an excellent performance.

350
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,140
Does Ca occur how?

351
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,410
All is prét.

352
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,440
The last!

353
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,600
The last!

354
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,490
Ok!

355
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Koi.

356
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,010
It was what this small fireworks.

357
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,680
Let us see!

358
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,320
It is all that my first fireworks can do?

359
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,260
Ok! Large Odama father!

360
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,650
Dad.

361
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,290
Mom, it is their fireworks…

362
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,930
They made a so pretty fireworks.

363
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,090
Mom…

364
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,300
Dad, you are really génials.!

365
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,940
I am unaware of.

366
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,680
If one day I will be able to create a similar fireworks…

367
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,100
Mom, Papaa!!

368
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,020

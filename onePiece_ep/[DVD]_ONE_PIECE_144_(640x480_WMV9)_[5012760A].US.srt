1
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,560
And Ben, this place was brilliant!

2
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,680
You find?

3
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,770
This cemetery of boats was rather alarming!

4
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,870
Bah, it was terrible and all, but…

5
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,560
I would go back a day well there!

6
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,460
It was so that?

7
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,160
It rains?

8
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,770
Ca… it is not rain.

9
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,870
Hail?

10
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,830
I do not think…

11
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,170
One would say rather…

12
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:29,820
One has steals the Log!
The King of the Fishing out, Masira!

13
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,290
HOLD GOOD!

14
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,730
KEEP THE CONTROL OF THE BOAT!

15
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,930
Hein?!

16
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,770
It is what that?!

17
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,970
He, but what it is?!

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,630
THAT EAST

19
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,630
WHAT?!

20
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,220
I dream!

21
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,580
Ouais, ouais, that must be a dream!

22
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,410
A dream?!

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:53,990
God merc…

24
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,360
Attention that continues to fall!

25
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,000
Made blunder!

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,280
Take the bar!

27
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,980
The bar!

28
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,650
It is not the sorrow with these waves!

29
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,050
Luffy! Protect the boat!

30
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,530
It is sufficiently damaged like that!

31
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,550
OK!

32
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,930
Usopp?

33
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,850
To dissipate its fears, to calm, close the eyes…

34
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,160
Then to open the eyelids slowly…

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,810
You see? Calm and peaceful…

36
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,810
A SKELETON!

37
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,810
CRETIN! DOES NOT LAUNCH IT ON ME!

38
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,360
ATTENTION, IN HERE Of OTHERS!!

39
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,460
A SKELETON!

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,410
CRETIN! DOES NOT LAUNCH IT ON ME!

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,250
How that is made that one
does boat fall from the sky like that?

42
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,620
Funny of phenomenon…

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,240
There is nothing up there.

44
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,140
Brothel, Grand Line is so alarming!

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,870
There was a cemetery of boats in the Fog of the Rainbow,

46
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,790
And maintaining a boat fall from the sky…

47
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,070
What doesn't go, Nami-san?

48
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,170
Ca fears!

49
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,570
The Log Installation is broken!

50
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,050
It is pointed towards the sky and it does not move any more!

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,550
Error!

52
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,670
An island having magnetic fields more powerful…

53
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,910
constrained the needle to indicate a new direction.

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,850
If it points to the top…

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,280
that wants to say that it is attracted by a celestial island.

56
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,850
A CELESTIAL ISLAND?!

57
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,480
It is what this is delirious?!

58
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,500
An island which flies in the sky?!

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,920
The boat filled with skeletons would have fallen from up there?!

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,250
But… there is nothing in
sky which resembles an island.

61
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,880
I would not say that.

62
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,120
To be more precise, an ocean is above us.

63
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,020
An ocean?!

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,250
It is increasingly strange.

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,250
Then there is an ocean with an island in the sky!

66
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,670
One goes there immediately!

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,010
Ok, the guy! At your stations!

68
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,610
DIRECTION SKY!

69
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,850
In any case, one cannot point the bar, Capitaine upwards.

70
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,350
To tell the truth, I never saw this celestial island.

71
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,950
and I do not know any about it!

72
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,250
Of course that not!

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,350
It is impossible!

74
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,250
Islands and oceans which float in the sky…

75
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,250
The Log Installation is broken, it is all.

76
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,950
Not, Madam the navigatrice.

77
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,340
The question is not to know if the Log Installation is broken or not.

78
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,400
But to find a means of going in the sky.

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,400
As odd as can appear the circumstances,

80
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,900
as delirious as can be the situation,

81
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,780
you should never doubt the Log Poses.

82
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
It is the gold rule.

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,720
On this ocean, if it is necessary to doubt something, it is of your own generally accepted ideas.

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,420
Where point this needle, you will find an island.

85
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,370
It opened the coffin…

86
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,470
But what does it make?

87
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,840
Then? What does that give?

88
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,720
I do not know.

89
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,720
You have morbid pastimes!

90
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,700
See a so pretty body beside one
corpse, it is rather nice in oneself.

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,720
Where is Luffy?

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,820
Jump, Luffy!

93
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,430
Okay!

94
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,050
What do they foutent these deux-là?

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,650
A small exploration.

96
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,900
Reconstitution carried out.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,530
These holes, here, are artificial.

98
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,730
Then this guy died
transpierced by something?

99
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,890
Not, it is the trace of a medical operation.

100
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,740
A trepanation, don't you think, Mister the Doctor?

101
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,900
Euh yes, formerly, to extract one
tumor, one bored a hole in cranium.

102
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,550
But it is an antiquated practice!

103
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,550
Exact, this man died
since at least two hundred years.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,650
He had just had about thirty.

105
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,350
During its voyage, he succumbed to a disease.

106
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,650
Its teeth were preserved better than the remainder of its skeleton.

107
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,200
They had to be tarred.

108
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,000
This habit is practiced
in an area of South Blue.

109
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,160
Taking into account the historical data, this ship carried out surely a mission of exploration.

110
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,320
Here.

111
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,620
This boat, Feels it Bliss, was originating in the kingdom of Bliss in South Blue.

112
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,920
It took the sea here are two hundred years.

113
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,940
It is this same boat which fell to us above.

114
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,440
Ouais, I saw the same symbol on his remains.

115
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,540
This wreck thus wandered in the sky during more than two hundred years.

116
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,850
You find all that only while examining some bones?

117
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,250
Deaths do not speak but they
many information contains.

118
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,400
If it were indeed a ship of exploration, there must remain indices among the remains.

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,960
Yes, but the wreck is almost absorbed.

120
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,060
AAH! BUT WHAT
YOU MANUFACTURE BROTHEL?!

121
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,060
LUFFY! HOLD GOOD!

122
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,760
<i>Au seglouuub! (With the help!)</i>

123
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,860
He, the guy!

124
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,860
I succeeded!

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
I made a super discovery!

126
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,060
Subdue that!

127
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,930
A chart of the celestial island?!

128
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,830
Skypiea?

129
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:04,830
Then?! Then?!

130
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,330
Then there is really an island in the sky?

131
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,180
One succeeded!

132
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,790
The celestial island exists!

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,930
An island of dream!

134
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,630
On the way for the paradise of the adventure!

135
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,430
The paradise!

136
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,650
Hurrah! Hurrah! The celestial island!

137
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,830
You do not pack too quickly.

138
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,130
Ca remains an assumption.

139
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,930
The world is truffle of trick cards.

140
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,010
On the way for the sky!

141
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,390
Oups, sorry.

142
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,390
It exists, it exists.

143
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,880
It exists, only…

144
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,750
Listen, Luffy!

145
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,620
I do not know how to go there!

146
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,220
Ah… Nami… gently with the boat.

147
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,590
It is you the navigatrice! Find!

148
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,790
It is not so simple that!

149
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,020
Nami-san is so beautiful when it is in anger…

150
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,870
Me into insane! I want to go in the sky!

151
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,540
We are wedged!

152
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,110
In all the cases, impossible to continue like that.

153
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,310
Robin rightly, it is necessary more information for us.

154
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,010
If this enormous vessel really went in the sky,

155
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,170
there exists surely a means of also going there.

156
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,670
It is necessary to recover more indices among the remains of the boat.

157
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,940
Ouais, but the wreck completely ran now.

158
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,660
If it ran, fish out it!

159
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,510
It left!

160
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,920
PAS AVEC CA!!

161
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,320
Fishing out?

162
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,210
It is a technique for
to reassemble the cast ships.

163
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,270
But one cannot fish out this one.

164
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,680
It is too large.

165
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,260
He, He, He, He.

166
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,830
You make us do anything!

167
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,210
NAMI-SWAN!

168
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,650
Count on me to bring back tons of indices on the celestial island!

169
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,780
I count on you!

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
Do not worry you.

171
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,710
My diving-suits are perfect!

172
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,940
And well, good luck.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
One will request for you.

174
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,240
Oh, oh, oh.

175
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
Here Chopper.

176
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,510
Answer, the guy.

177
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,910
Here Luffy!

178
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,910
Y' has a package of monsters here!

179
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,810
It is a nest of giant alarming specters!

180
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,110
Here Sanji! Ouah, y' has of them one which looks at me!

181
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,340
Ok.

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,540
OK?!

183
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,010
All will be well! They will be able to manage!

184
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,050
Chopper, hold the brake well!

185
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,750
Yes.

186
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,080
Pfiou… I made well of step go there.

187
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:33,280
[Note:Sarubeji (ang. Salvage) = fishing out]

188
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,740
<i>Sarubeji! Saru-Be-ji! </i>

189
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,280
<i>Sarubeji! Saru-Be-ji! </i>

190
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,780
<i>Sarubeji! </i>

191
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,580
It is what that?

192
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,810
<i>Saru-be-ji! </i>

193
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,510
<i>Sarubeji! Saru-Be-ji! </i>

194
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,510
<i>Sarubeji! </i>

195
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,260
<i>Saru-be-ji! </i>

196
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,060
With my command, halt!

197
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,560
AYE, AYE, SIR!

198
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,620
It is here that the wreck sank?!

199
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,120
AYE, AYE, SIR!

200
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,340
BOSS!

201
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,040
BOSS…!

202
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,940
It is of ME that they speak!

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,970
Everyone at its station!

204
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,370
This run ship belongs from now on to the Boss of the pirates of Masira…

205
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,900
The King of the Fishing out, Masira!

206
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,190
And just when one did not need that, of the balls point themselves.

207
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,790
Oh, you them guy! What you made there?

208
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,890
It is my territory!

209
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,210
Your territory?

210
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,560
Ouaip!

211
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,360
All the ships which run here are with me!

212
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,760
I advise you of step to touch there!

213
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,600
Apparently, it for fishing out the wreck.

214
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,740
Ouais, one would say.

215
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,450
And then?

216
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,370
It is a chance, not?

217
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,580
Stop your chatterings!

218
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,550
Answer when I speak to you!

219
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,350
Excuse me! Do I can ask you a question?

220
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,940
You will answer the mienne?!

221
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
Good!

222
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,200
Go ahead installation!

223
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,040
Hope to be reduced the wreck to surface?

224
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,490
Hein? Saru?

225
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,490
[Note:Saru (beji); saru = monkey]

226
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,270
You really find that I have the air of a monkey?

227
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,670
A monkey?

228
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,610
Ca wants to say that I am beautiful
kid! You really think it?

229
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,020
Of course…

230
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,850
Not, you are too pleasant!

231
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,290
You pleasant there.

232
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,860
Then, you will fish out it?

233
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,160
Obviously! The question does not even arise!

234
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,080
If a boat runs, it is with me to fish out it!

235
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,530
And if it still floats, I run it and then I go up it!

236
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,160
There does not exist any ship but
my crew doesnot can save!

237
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,060
Then…

238
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,920
One can look at?

239
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,950
Did Oh, then you never attend a fishing out?

240
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,380
Ca rolls! Approach and admire the spectacle!

241
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,320
Perfect!

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,240
Let us observe their technique, the guy!

243
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,550
Att… Attention…

244
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,990
Chief! There is a problem!

245
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,980
Which?!

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,680
When the cradle touched the ocean floor, the crew…

247
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,200
They were made have by a monstre marin?

248
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,180
Not, one would say rather than somebody tabassés them!

249
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,180
What?!

250
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
There is somebody in bottom?!

251
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,690
It is them…

252
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,290
Shit… Oh shit.

253
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,560
Then…

254
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,200
He, you them guy!

255
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,620
Ah! Us…

256
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,440
There is of the intruders in bottom!

257
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,470
Made blunder!

258
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,770
O-Okay!

259
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,290
God thank you, it is a cretin.

260
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,490
THE GUYS, TURN OVER TO FIX THE CRADLE!

261
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,920
LET US GO UP THIS WRECK!

262
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,500
AYE! AYE! SIR!

263
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,290
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

264
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,710
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

265
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,720
It makes us sign…

266
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,730
Usopp, one should not especially
that he notices the air pumps.

267
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,690
I… know… well.

268
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,980
Go, the guy.

269
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,030
Made not attention!

270
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,130
They are right spectators.

271
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,940
You do not let impress!

272
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,850
AYE, AYE, SIR!

273
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,250
Low the cradle!

274
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,250
AYE, AYE, SIR!

275
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,270
And take guard with the intruders well!

276
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,990
AYE, AYE, SIR!

277
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,100
They have the air very proud of their work.

278
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,240
I believe that they really make a point of impressing us.

279
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,710
Do not waste time!

280
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,210
AYE, AYE, SIR!

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,460
He.

282
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,330
Above.

283
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Fixing of the cradle confirmed!

284
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,960
It is what this tru…?!

285
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,330
It is what this trick? This monkey there?!

286
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,200
There is a monkey why there?

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,870
Oh, that?

288
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,820
You have the eye, p' tit guy.

289
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,580
Yes, it is not an ordinary figure de proue.

290
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,980
AVOID TO PLUNGE!

291
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,230
BARCO HUNTER!

292
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,030
AYE, AYE, SIR!

293
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,940
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

294
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,740
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

Monkey, monkey, monkey!

297
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,240
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

298
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,640
Monkey, monkey, monkey!

299
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,050
Ouah, it is terrible!

300
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,350
Incredible!

301
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,200
You find?

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,350
Forty meters before the target!

303
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,300
Thirty meters.

304
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,980
Twenty…

305
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:46,930
Ten…

306
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,430
Barco Hunter stowing…

307
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,460
Succeeded!

308
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,700
Perfect!

309
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,870
It is the moment to blow!

310
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,980
AYE, AYE, SIR!

311
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,800
Not possible!

312
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,550
It really will bring back the wreck into blowing in this tube?

313
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,720
It is nutcase!

314
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,110
Air?!

315
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,610
The wreck goes up!

316
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,140
Now! Fish out to me that!

317
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,410
AYE, AYE, SIR!

318
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,310
Continue to send air!

319
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,510
AYE, AYE, AYE, SIR!

320
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,340

321
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,380
INTRUDERS!

That there is?!

323
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,870
What occurred, the guys?!

324
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,940
There is somebody aboard ship!

325
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,670
DUMBS, HOW YOU DARE

326
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,960
YOU SUMMERS WHICH IN THE JUSTE?!

327
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,580
Afflicted, we do not have a camera.

328
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,680
Good Ah?!

329
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,730
It posed for a photograph?

330
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,430
Boss! With the aid…

331
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,280
Hold good! I arrive!

332
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,180
You others, continue the fishing out!

333
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,480
AYE, AYE, SIR!

334
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,840
MONKEY PUNCH!

335
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,550
Here we are!

336
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,320
Ouf! One can withdraw our diving-suits.

337
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,860
Which incredible quantity of air.

338
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,160
But I wonder who am going up the wreck…

339
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,610
Me, I hope especially that
Nami-san and Robin-chan are well!

340
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,400
I tried to contact them,
but they did not answer!

341
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,100
WHO SUMMERS YOU BROTHEL?!

342
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,740
Who dares to come to encroach on my territory?!

343
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,550
Ah, a monkey.

344
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,000
I have really the air of a monkey?!

345
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,300
Ouaip, you make more monkey than a true monkey.

346
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,950
You stop this weak conversation?

347
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,250
Ben what?

348
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,430
From where you leave, you?

349
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,530
Oh, what a impolite I ouais make!

350
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,710
You have the eye, you know!

351
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,390
He, one required of you who you stays!

352
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,970
He… under the boat…

353
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,690
Something approaches…

354
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,770
Then as that you come from East Blue?

355
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,220
Ouaip!

356
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,290
And more I look at you, more I find that you resemble a monkey!

357
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,670
Stop flattering me! You want to make me redden?

358
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,880
It IS WHAT CA?!

359
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,640
It IS WHAT?!

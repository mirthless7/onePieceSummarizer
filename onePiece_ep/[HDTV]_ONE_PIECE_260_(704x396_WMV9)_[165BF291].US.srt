1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,800
Length-nose-kun.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,000
Try to dodge that!

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,600
Ramen Kenpo Fukumen Spank

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,600
Note:fukumen spank means “double noodle smacking”.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,240
Usually in a combat, I use neither my hands, nor my knives,

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,730
because it is crowned for a cook.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,700
But since one is in a kitchen…

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,830
and that you make use of food,

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,270
it is another history.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
Let to me show itself…

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,000
technique of a cook of first class.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,800
Special Houchou Sabaki

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,800
Note:special houchou sabaki means “special handling of the couteaux de cuisine”.

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,600
Dumb…

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
What is this qu…

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But be to you which brothel?!

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,500
What doesn't go, Ramen Kenpou?

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,500
Where did your promptness pass?

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,000
Cursed would be you! Salt shameless.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,600
Although you would be only one criminal!

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,900
My fist-noodles are of pieces!!

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,000
I am…

23
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,300
an onion!!

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
That is not used for nothing to continue the combat.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Admit your defeat and lets pass to me.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,800
To admit my defeat?! How if I were going to do that!

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Who said that I was overcome?!

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,700
I am have CP7, Wanze!

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Unfortunately, I know the importance of this mission.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,000
Your friend Nico Robin was pursued by the government during many years.

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
One will not let it leave so easily, idiot!

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
Ramen Kenpo

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Note:menkui knocker means “hammer of noodle piles”.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,100
Menkui Knocker

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,900
With onions, initially to cut the stem and the root without touching the heart.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,600
The taste is preserved…

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,400
while cutting them systematically.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,800
Stop! Does not approach you!

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
Note:ramen beam means “bar of ramen”.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
Ramen beam

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Weeding

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,400
Although you would be only one cook of third class which plays with food,

43
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,500
I nevertheless congratulate you for maintenance on your knives.

44
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:09,870
Franky VS Nero

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:09,870
Duel on the roof!

46
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,000
Note:Hoshi Shield means “Spangled Shield”.

47
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,000
It is Hoshi Shield.

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,300
It is what this body?! It is not human!

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Still fire!

50
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Note:master nail means “main nail”.

51
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Master Nail

52
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,200
Still flown away… I do not include/understand how…

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,300
One can nothing make there if the four styles do not go.

54
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,900
I do not control Shigan yet…

55
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,500
I thus will have to use some tricks.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,300
Yosh! It is my chance to advance to the next car!

57
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,400
He! wait, bastard!

58
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,500
I can blink eyes even more.

59
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,700
You were well made have.

60
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,500
Note:beans left means “remaining beans”.

61
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,500
Beans left

62
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
Too bad.

63
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,900
Exactly…

64
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,900
what I provided that you make!

65
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
IEA!!

66
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,800
That went.

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
This bastard!

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Note:ouche finger means “finger which makes sore”.

69
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Ouche Finger

70
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,240
Soru

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
Shit,

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,900
he noticed.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,490
Rankyaku

74
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,800
That passed very close to me.

75
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Which flexible type.

76
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
Then your weak point…

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
it is your back, hein?

78
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Me also I included/understood how you think.

79
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,400
It is nothing any more but one matter of time before this combat is not completed.

80
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,700
Wait before taking the famous person!

81
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,500
If I do that, I will not have any more weak points.

82
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,590
Invincible Franky

83
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,000
Invincible.

84
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
What say some to you, stupid weasel?!

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,300
What should I say to him?

86
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,500
What does that want to say?

87
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,600
Why are you there?

88
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,500
How did you come here?

89
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I cannot answer, you pose too many questions.

90
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Good, we calm.

91
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,400
Ah…

92
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,100
A little coffee?

93
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,900
Do not talk cock!

94
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
How…

95
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,100
Charmed to meet you. I am the King of Snipers, Sogeking.

96
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,100
To make short, I came to save you.

97
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,700
Length-nose-kun…

98
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,400
And there is not only me.

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,300
There is Sanji-kun and named Franky the gangster which fight in the train.

100
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,000
I benefitted from it to come here.

101
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,300
Moreover, Luffy-kun and the others follow us with another Umi Ressha.

102
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,700
With a whole group, apparently.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
I looked by the window before coming here.

104
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
But the four in the preceding car had the very dangerous air.

105
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,000
The ideal would be to save you before Sanji-kun does not meet them!

106
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,000
Let us let us go both!

107
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,500
What doesn't go?

108
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,600
You do not have to worry, I very envisaged.

109
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Note:okutopa-Kutsu means “shoe-octopus” (or suction cup).

110
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Here your okutopa-kutsu.

111
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,300
If you put them at the hands and the feet, you will be able to climb by the window and to stud yourself in Umi Ressha.

112
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,400
Go, before they see us.

113
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,300
Wait.

114
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
“Wait”?

115
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Why that does it occur thus?

116
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,200
I clearly did you my good-byes.

117
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,800
I will never return in the crew!

118
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,000
They know all why…

119
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,200
you said that.

120
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Ice-ossan of the shipyard very explained.

121
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
It is well?

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,400
Not,

123
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,700
even thus,

124
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,400
I will not return with you.

125
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,900
About what you do speak?

126
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
You still do not include/understand?!

127
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
They are not as weak as you think it!

128
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,100
They wanted to speak to you before you do not make this stupid market!

129
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,100
You should have spoken to them about it front!

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You think that they will be content…

131
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,400
if they sacrifice a friend right to save themselves?!

132
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Now that they know why you left,

133
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,400
they will follow you until in hell…

134
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
and all your enemies will destroy!

135
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,000
You still do not know what a kind of Luffy man is!

136
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,500
It is you who do not include/understand!

137
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,500
I did not ask to be saved!

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
Remain apart from that!

139
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,300
What?!

140
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Why this din, Nico Robin?

141
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,500
What doesn't go?

142
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
Now that Enies Lobby is in approach,

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,200
you cannot remain calm any more?

144
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,000
Even if you cry over your own destiny,

145
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,200
your life will not be saved for as much.

146
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
It is nothing.

147
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,700
Was C-C' what that? It is suspect…

148
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
It would be said that it of changed there something into it…

149
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
It is right my imagination?

150
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,500
I said that it was nothing.

151
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,400
Then please, leave me.

152
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,600
But what does she play?

153
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
A rabbit?

154
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,300
Oï! Stop that-shaow!

155
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,200
Stop talking cock and fight sérieusement-shaow!
Upright!

156
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,400
Supervise your language, stupid weasel.

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,500
I do not joke.

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,600
But finally, you ace not of chance.

159
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,700
You ace really not of bowl.

160
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,400
You returned to me furious.

161
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,700
This week I am in SUPER form!

162
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
He, frérot…

163
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,300
You know the monster which one calls Centaure?

164
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,700
That which is semi-human, semi-horse, it is that-shaow?

165
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,100
Where do you want to come from there?

166
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,300
Hentai!

167
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,700
Note:hentai means “abnormal character here”. (Pun with the other translation:transformation.)

168
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,000
Abnormal character

169
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,700
Critical situation

170
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Me known as step only it…

171
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,430
Note:Franky Kentaurusu means “Franky the Centaur”.

172
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,430
Franky Kentaurusu

173
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,790
It is the reverse! Your body is with back!

174
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,900
Do not criticize before to have seen its power.

175
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,100
Why one still does not see Bashing Tom?

176
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,470
Puffing!!!

177
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,300
He, Luffy! Return inside!

178
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,900
You have just changed clothes and be already very soaked to you!

179
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,700
They is good! It is my seat!

180
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
Gomu gomu No….

181
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,300
300 pound…

182
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,800
CANON!!
GIFT!

183
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
Splash!!

184
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,500
More Laguna!

185
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
STOP PLAYING, BAND Of MORONS!!

186
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
One is bored.

187
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,400
Prepare your weapons or another thing, idiots!

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,300
Ben… euh… will be necessary that I speak to them presently…

189
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,100
Oï, the guy!

190
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
I see a train right in front of us!

191
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
It is Puffing Tom!

192
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,200
It is not a little too early?

193
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,900
Let pass to me!!!

194
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,300
Will shit… what arrive to us?

195
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
There is not any more an engine. All that one can do is to wait.

196
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,700
One pitches!

197
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,600
But will somebody help us with this storm?

198
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
There are not any more other choices, if nobody saves us.

199
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,900
Oï, everyone! Something arrives by the back!

200
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,700
Really?

201
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,700
A lifeboat.

202
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Not, in fact,

203
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,600
it would be said that it makes use of the rails.

204
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,000
Not possible.

205
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,500
There is one Umi Ressha in the world.

206
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,500
And it was impossible to leave Water 7 after the last train.

207
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,500
Well…

208
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,100
Then…

209
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
What approaches?

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,900
Oï!

211
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
It is Umi Ressha, but there is no engine! There are only cars!

212
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,000
It is stopped on the rail!

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,900
What?!

214
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,800
WHAT SE PASSES?!

215
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,800
It would be said that they were detached.

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
Sanji and Usopp are perhaps on board!

217
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,100
Franky Aniki, too!

218
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,730
They is bad! At this rate/rhythm, one will strike it!

219
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,070
Granny-san, brakes!

220
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,600
No chance that they go.

221
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,400
Made something.

222
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,300
One will be crushed!!

223
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,300
Nyaaa nyaaaa!!

224
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,500
Luffy, which do you hope to make?

225
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,300
I will see what there is inside.

226
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,630
Gomu Gomu No…

227
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Rocket

228
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Something flies.

229
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,300
Yosha, I did it.

230
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,000
Qu-Qui you are brothel?!

231
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,500
Oooï Sanji, be to you there?!

232
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,400
Usopp…

233
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Oooï, Sanjiii!!

234
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Oooï!!

235
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,490
Are Z' there?

236
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,000
Me known as step that it is…

237
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
It IS LUFFY WITH the STRAW HAT!!

238
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,800
Oooï!!!

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,400
You are there?! Sanji?!

240
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
Sanji…?!

241
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Close it!

242
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,100
Straw hat, you do not have nowhere where to flee!

243
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,000
Where is Sanji?

244
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Is Qu-Qui it?

245
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,500
Sanji, it is a companion with me!

246
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,300
This guy is not known!

247
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I see…

248
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,300
With more.

249
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,700
FIRE!!

250
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,600
Straw hat left!

251
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,700
He says that they are not there… while one draws to him above…

252
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
Then there is only of the guy of the government inside.

253
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,200
And what do you hope to make?

254
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,100
If it is not moved, it will longer remain us to live.

255
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
It is Umi Ressha after all!

256
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,600
One will be made propel in the airs.

257
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,100
Not, one will explode if it returns us inside!

258
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,390
STOP!

259
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,200
It is with the tower of Franky Family now. One will bone it right before striking it!

260
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Yosh! One will help you!

261
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,100
The guy, one has job!

262
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
OUAIS!!

263
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,700
Oooï, Zoro!

264
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,900
Oï, Roronoa, it calls you.

265
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,800
Cut it. That obstructs.

266
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Ouais.

267
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,600
“Ouais”, which he says!

268
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,900
It will strike us!
STOP!

269
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,100
Ego in a world of ruins.

270
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,500
I will cut it.

271
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,940
Nitouryü Iai

272
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Note:Nitouryü means “Style with 2 Sabers”.
           Iai is art to leave a saber, to cut its opponent and to arrange the saber very quickly.

273
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,200
Rashömon

274
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,200
Note:Rashömon means “door” in old dialect of Kyoto.

275
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,600
He, the guy! If you continue to make similar tricks, warn us front!

276
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
You intended me to say to him “Cuts it”?

277
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,900
It was not thought that it would really cut it!

278
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,300
But one would have been crushed if it had not cut it!

279
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes, but… one was to prepare.

280
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,700
It is monstrueusement strong and yet it is not the captain…

281
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
They are impressive!

282
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
Frankly, you are incredible!

283
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
I did not know that there was second Umi Ressha.

284
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,600
To this pace, they surely will catch up with them.

285
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,100
So by misfortune, the criminals whom one captured were to be saved…

286
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,900
That will not arrive!

287
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,300
This man is between…

288
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,600
first Umi Ressha and them!

289
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,800
It is true!

290
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,800
As long as the Navy has this man,

291
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,200
our justice will not flanchera!

292
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,300
Yosh, it left!

293
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Nitouryü Iai!

294
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,600
Rashömon!!

295
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,400
He, it is not you the train?!

296
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,500
Why?! Do it to you!

297
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,600
, Do it to you!

298
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,300
Not question! I do not want to be destroyed!

299
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,300
You must be made destroy!

300
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
I do not want!

301
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
Oï, the guy!

302
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,500
It is not finished yet.

303
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,000
It is what that?!

304
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,500
It is a King of the seas.

305
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,200
He is enormous…

306
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,400
Sashimi!

307
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,200
Note:Sashimi is a Japanese traditional dish containing believed fish.

308
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,900
It is cut into two!

309
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Roasted Poisson!

310
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,000
Really enormous…

311
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,500
Rocket Man with the tiny air at side!

312
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
It is right in front of…

313
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
that which sliced it.

1
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:39,420
The green city Erumalu

2
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:39,420
And Kung Fu Dugong!

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,300
With the kingdom of the Oases.

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,460
Three years were passed since the last drop of rain.

5
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,200
In order to find hope during this time of disorders, the inhabitants decided to take the weapons.

6
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,740
In a howl of sadness, this desiccated ground sinks from now on in an enormous wave of agitation.

7
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,940
In Nanohana, port city of Arabasta, Luffy found his/her Ace brother…

8
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,540
… which made the demonstration of the talents acquired thanks to the fruit Mera Mera.

9
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,020
The crew goes up the Sandora river now with Ace to reach Yuba.

10
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,730
Halt! State the goal of your visit!

11
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
Please, let have an audience with His Majesty to us the King!

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,130
How long still will this civil war last?

13
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,980
Between it and the dryness, there remain to us nothing to eat!

14
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,400
Please, save my child!

15
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,010
I do not have any more milk to give him!

16
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,250
Wait! Do not push!

17
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,720
We cannot let to you pass!

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,540
Please, let speak to us with His Highness!

19
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,560
Will you let to us die thus!?

20
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,710
Hey, why you do not say anything?!

21
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,830
Do you intend to let to us die?

22
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,760
Ouais, known as something!

23
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,570
Dirty dogs!

24
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,540
How do you dare address yourselves thus to His Majesty!?

25
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,270
Is enough!

26
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,630
Guards!

27
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,590
Forgive me.

28
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,040
My incompetence caused the intolerable sufferings which you undergo.

29
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,280
Please, that those which want to speak to me enter and their problems expose me.

30
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:00,470
For the moment, all that I can make is to listen to your complaints and to think of it as if they were mine.

31
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,050
Hold out still a little bit, please.

32
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,750
I swear to restore peace in this kingdom.

33
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,530
Even at the price of my own life!

34
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,430
Father, it is a plot!

35
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,540
It is obvious that somebody seeks to destroy our kingdom!

36
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,210
Es you in life and good health?

37
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,400
Where are you now…?

38
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,790
Vivi…

39
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,050
The tea is been useful.

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,900
We are in the kitchen.

41
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,920
Thank you, Sanji-San.

42
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,880
Hello! I am the Onigiri-Usopp captain!

43
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,290
Oh, and which are you, without indiscretion?

44
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,950
Meshi = Food; Daru de Yukidaruma (bonhomme de neige)

45
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,950
I am Meshidaru-San!

46
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,390
DO NOT PLAY WITH FOOD!

47
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,390
If you are bored so much, thus will make the crockery!

48
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,660
Bento = cold Meal in a small box

49
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,660
Good blood! I try to finish our bentos before we do not unload!

50
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,700
Can I help for anything?

51
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,110
Not, you are a guest on this boat.

52
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,740
Thus remain sitted.

53
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Heard.

54
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,790
YOU WASH THE PLATES WITH DIRTY SPONGES!!

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,330
Which pleasant breeze…

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,530
Nami-San.

57
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,920
Can we drop anchor here a small moment?

58
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,910
Why?

59
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,650
I will entrust to Karu an important mission.

60
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
In Karu?

61
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,310
Karu…

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,980
I want that you only go to the palate of Alubarna to give this letter to my father.

63
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:04,160
I wrote all that Igaram and me discovered on Crocodile and its bonds with Baroque Work…

64
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:11,210
I also say to him that I am always in life and that I return with very determined companions.

65
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,040
Can you do it?

66
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,000
You will have to cross the desert alone…

67
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,110
Listen well, does not forget to ration you out of water while you cross-pieces the desert, hein.

68
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,470
Well! Do of tone better!

69
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,270
And you will say to my father…

70
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,360
… how this kingdom is about to be saved!

71
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,390
I said to you to ration yourself!

72
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,540
Karu…

73
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,770
I count on you.

74
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,700
I knew that Shichibukai Crocodile was in this kingdom…

75
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,220
But which already heard of a pirate seeking to seize a kingdom?

76
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,970
Which dirty trick.

77
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,760
A pirate, to drop anchor for good and to confine themselves at only one place?

78
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,190
I cannot believe that he wants to take the place of the king.

79
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,460
Yosh! Ahead all!

80
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,980
He, I wait am not yet on board!

81
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,450
There could well be more behind this takeover that what he appears to with it with the first access.

82
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,990
More?

83
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,730
Ouais, a stronger, more important reason.

84
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,840
The kingdom of the desert, Arabasta.

85
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,590
Even with a history being spread out over thousands of years since its creation over these sands,

86
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,560
… the desert always been able death.

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,560
This country in the shade of was died since its beginnings.

88
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,740
We have just received a message:

89
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,880
Boats of the Billions stationed with Nanohana…

90
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,050
all were destroyed by an unknown force.

91
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,220
I have just had the confirmation of this news.

92
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,080
The Billions are easily replaceable.

93
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,550
It is not because a water drop falls into the desert…

94
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,990
that the plan is called into question.

95
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,230
However, if somebody, in one way or another, wants to be opposed to me…

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,340
Crush it.

97
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,470
As you want.

98
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,860
Erimaku = Lizard with flange.

99
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,860
I already sent the Erimaku messengers to carry this message.

100
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,600
Splendid.

101
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,650
We are there finally.

102
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,640
One finally will be able to walk in the desert!

103
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,680
It must be rather hot there…

104
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,590
I intended to say that the temperature could exceed the 50°C during the day.

105
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,190
What?

106
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,560
Be serious for you?

107
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,160
What You ES ARRIVES, NAMI-SAN?!

108
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,870
OR IS HELD MT OF DANCER?!

109
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,750
NOOOON! NOT VIVI-CHAN TOO!

110
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,360
WHY YOU CARRY CA?!

111
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,220
But we would be burned by the intense rays of the sun if we expose our skin.

112
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,440
Ah, misery…

113
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,040
My dear dancers…

114
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,410
Luffy-San, mets that, please.

115
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,480
Oh, thank you.

116
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,170
Prepare we to unload.

117
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,870
Ouais.

118
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,100
Go, everyone with ground.

119
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,850
What…?

120
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,670
Tortoises?

121
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,240
You want to say seals, not?

122
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,390
Of Kung Fu Dugong!

123
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,230
“If you want to unload here, it will be necessary for you to face me and beat me.”

124
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,930
“If you are frightened too much, thus accost on other bank, hens wet.”

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
Here what he said.

126
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,440
I cannot remain without anything to make after being treated of wet hen.

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,390
I ARRIVE!

128
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,730
Wait, Usopp-San!!

129
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,570
Kung Fu Dugong are very strong!

130
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,960
I gained!

131
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,720
It would seem that we have a winner here.

132
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,810
To gain is still worse!

133
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,380
What?

134
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,210
The code of Kung Fu Dugong obliges them to become the disciple of that which overcame them.

135
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,860
Truths fans of martial arts.

136
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,630
IT WAS MADE EVEN MORE DISCIPLES WHILE ONE SPOKE!

137
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,650
YOSH! MADE ALL LIKE ME!

138
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,750
IN POSITION!

139
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,050
THE FIST AHEAD!

140
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,120
The movement is done of before behind, go.

141
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,380
Well!

142
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,410
Go ahead!

143
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,860
STILL!

144
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,820
STILL!

145
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,900
STILL!

146
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,040
Yosh! On the way for Yuba!

147
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,230
Wait a little, there…

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,420
YOU WILL NOT TAKE THEM ALONG WITH YOU?!

149
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,930
You cannot, Luffy!

150
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,430
Dugongs cannot cross the desert.

151
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,740
Nice!                   Nice!

152
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,200
I have the impression to be petty towards them…

153
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,210
Me also…

154
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,660
What will we make?

155
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,140
I know!

156
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,280
What do you seek?

157
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,380
Here, I give you that if you remain here wisely, of agreement?

158
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,690
With the assistance!

159
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,030
Chopper!

160
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,730
BYE BYE!

161
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,630
Listen, Luffy!

162
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,440
You see well in which situation one is?

163
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
Is they said that they came with me, why it impossible?

164
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,580
One cannot go in a city with as much world!

165
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,250
Moron!

166
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,460
Frankly, one would have been in beautiful cloths if Chopper had not convinced them!

167
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,790
Ouais, they continued to say “follow We it!”

168
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,730
If one had not given them to eat, they would have really done it.

169
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,840
PF, thanks to you, our reserves dropped well.

170
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,760
It brings only troubles, hein?

171
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,730
Seriously.

172
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,160
It is what?

173
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,850
It is Yuba?

174
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,320
Not.

175
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,570
It is Erumalu.

176
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,340
It was called formerly the Green City.

177
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
The Green City?

178
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,110
To see this city, you can include/understand…

179
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,790
how much Baroque Works made of evil to this country.

180
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,210
And how much the people suffer from Arabasta.

181
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,850
Ouah, has there really nothing here.

182
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,950
Yes… But even if the city is today in ruin,

183
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,470
until its collapse, it was an alive city filled with luxuriant flowers.

184
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,710
This city, hein?

185
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,120
This area forever have much water, but…

186
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,710
by recovering water at the time of the rare downpours, the city had opened out.

187
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,570
However, these three last years…

188
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,690
not only one water drop did not fall into all the kingdom.

189
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,050
Three years?!

190
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,220
Also a long time?

191
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,040
But even without rain, you always have this river which we went up.

192
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,290
It is true, you could not simply draw from the water of this large river?

193
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,920
The answer is a little further.

194
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:31,410
An complete absence of precipitations is a misfortune which did not arrive in Arabasta since thousands of years.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,820
But there was a place where there was always rain.

196
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,030
It was in the capital, Alubarna,

197
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,940
where the royal palace is.

198
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,030
People called that the royal miracle.

199
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,950
Until the day of this disastrous incident.

200
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,780
Discharge the boats!

201
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,740
It is reversed!

202
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,810
Caution!

203
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,240
Does He, that go?

204
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,240
You are wounded?

205
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,970
Oh, shit! One is badly there!

206
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,820
We were to make sure that the delivery with King Cobra in Alubarna was well made!

207
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,270
But it is what this powder with the Juste?

208
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,670
Euh, what?

209
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,460
Hum, we do not know!

210
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,890
We obey the orders of your King, it is all!

211
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,410
Not true?

212
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,830
We are right deliverymen.

213
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,120
Let us flee!

214
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,030
C it cannot be…

215
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,900
It was of Dance Powder?

216
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,950
What? You of ace heard speak?

217
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,800
Yes…

218
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,760
It is also called it “powder-which-fact-to rain”.

219
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,300
“Which-fact-to rain”?

220
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,580
It is only one hearsay, but…

221
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,820
it is said that she was invented by a scientist of a kingdom where it never rained.

222
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,830
Once burned, the powder releases a kind of fog which rises in the airs…

223
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,420
and which creates rain artificially.

224
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,230
Here what is Dance Powder.

225
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,780
Ah, included/understood!

226
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,470
You speak about the Magic Powder.

227
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,910
I ate some does not have a little there a long time.

228
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,200
It is really dégueu!

229
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,390
Isn't Ca eaten, you know?

230
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,900
In other words, that made rain, what.

231
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,790
What do you have, the guy?

232
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,750
You think that I lie, it is that?!

233
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,710
He!

234
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,450
Await a little, if this kind of trick exists,

235
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,060
I say the truth!

236
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,570
it is the ideal for this country, not?

237
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,840
It is what they believed, yes.

238
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,780
As its name implies it, the inhabitants of the kingdom danced initially of joy when this powder was invented.

239
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,130
But it has an enormous defect.

240
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,410
Indeed, it causes the dryness in the countries under the wind.

241
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,540
You include/understand?

242
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,200
Dance Powder is fixed on small clouds…

243
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,310
… which differently would have continued to travel to the liking of the winds while being gorged little by little with moisture

244
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,560
and the force to earlier reach the stage of cloud of rain so that it rains.

245
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,180
And then…

246
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,060
Ah of agreement.

247
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,830
Approximately, that steals the rain which should normally have fallen on another country.

248
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,900
Blow, a formidable war burst between two kingdoms.

249
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,580
The human losses were numerous.

250
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,030
The World Government since put a world interdict on the manufacture and the detention of Dance Powder.

251
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,570
A powder which brings at the same time happiness and misfortune, hein?

252
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,830
All this Dance Powder was conveyed in our port…

253
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,250
at one moment when it did not rain nowhere in safe Arabasta in the capital…

254
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,490
The reason for which it does not rain on our grounds is that the King uses this Dance Powder!

255
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,750
The rain with Alubarna is not due to a miracle!

256
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,260
We die of thirst and hunger right because of the King!

257
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,460
WHAT, VIVI!?

258
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,410
YOUR FATHER MALICIOUS EAST!!

259
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,230
MORON!

260
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,570
He was trapped!

261
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,300
How the father of Vivi-Chan it could ever have done something of similar?! Never!?

262
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,890
Never!

263
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,540
Never!

264
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,020
Never!

265
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,520
Never! Never!

266
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,020
Never! Never! Never!

267
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,800
Never! Never! Never! Never!!!

268
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,530
Of course, my father did not have any idea what did without.

269
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
And at the same moment,

270
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,180
great quantities of Dance Powder were discovered in the palate even.

271
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,220
Then, there were traitors even in the palate…

272
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,220
What is it that this road, Vivi-Chan?

273
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,730
It is there that the channel used by the city passed formerly to draw from the water of the Sandora river.

274
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,510
But one day, this channel was mysteriously destroyed.

275
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,420
Without him, the Green City did not can provide longer for its requirements out of water.

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,080
The inhabitants continued to wait with the energy of despair…

277
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,400
But the rain obstinately refused to fall.

278
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,700
And since the incident of Dance Powder, suspicion towards the King increased the every day regularly.

279
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,060
The plan of Crocodile went to the hair…

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,530
The confrontation was inevitable.

281
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,120
Exhausted, people left towards the other oases, to avoid the conflict and to obtain water.

282
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,890
The cities were abandoned.

283
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,490
And then…

284
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,740
The Green City fell in ruin.

285
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,530
What is it?

286
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,450
There is somebody?

287
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,560
It is the rebellious army?

288
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,380
They is perhaps assassins of Works Baroque!?

289
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,930
Nan.

290
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,480
It is right the wind.

291
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,010
Ca resembles voices.

292
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,240
They come from everywhere!

293
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,350
What do we have to make?

294
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,860
Hein, big brother!?

295
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,330
There is nothing to fear.

296
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,460
The wind crosses the city while passing between the buildings in ruin.

297
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,340
The city…

298
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,260
It is as if the town of Erumalu cried!

299
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,840
Ca arrives!

300
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,150
Was nutcase, what it that this wind?

301
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,110
There is somebody up there!

302
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,760
There would be still somebody of alive in this city…!?

303
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,140
Father…

304
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,780
What Father and the inhabitants of this kingdom made to deserve that?

305
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:17,350
To destroy the life of those which fought against Nature to live in this desert…

306
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,930
Why?

307
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,500
Of which right does do it that!?

308
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,780
Why?

309
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:30,100
It acts as if he were the saver of the people because he is Shichibukai…!

310
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,540
And nobody carries out that it takes part in the destruction of the kingdom!

311
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,320
Crocodile!

312
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,430
Crocodile!

313
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,680
Crocodile!

314
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,910
Crocodile!

315
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,200
Crocodile!

316
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,730
Crocodile!

317
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,720
I…

318
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,490
I will never forgive him!

319
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,730
Good blood…

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
You are really kids.

321
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,940
Vivi!

322
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,980
It is necessary to go from the front one.

323
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,390
We remained here too a long time.

324
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,580
Allons-y, in Yuba.

325
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,000
It is well there that is the rebellious army, not?

326
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:25,900
Yes.

327
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,810
I will persuade the chief to stop the insurrection.

328
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,150
To persuade?

329
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,080
All misfortunes of Arabasta are the result of the schemes of Crocodile!

330
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,610
I will tell them the truth and will put a term at this useless bloodshed!

331
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,720
Included/understood.

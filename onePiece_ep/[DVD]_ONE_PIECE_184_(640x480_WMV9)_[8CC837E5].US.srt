1
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,719
On board the Maxim Arch,

2
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,260
God Eneru and Luffy
clash finally!

3
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,260
What are you thus?

4
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,300
Dumb!

5
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,550
I am Luffy.

6
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,510
Pirate and Man-Rubber band.

7
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,840
Rubber band?

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,149
Power of the lightning
do not affect a Man-Rubber band.

9
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,100
Even Very Powerful Eneru
start to fear Luffy!

10
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,150
GLOAM

11
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,350
PADDLING

12
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,580
Gomu Gomu No Ono

13
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,290
Whereas the combat in is
soon with its paroxysm,

14
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,590
the Gold Arch, Maxim,
rise in the airs!

15
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,570
Circuits for the ultimate function of the Arch
were engaged, and they turn to full mode.

16
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,359
Its name is Deathpiea.

17
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,490
It is the name of the despair which
will be the saver of this world!

18
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,589
Then to be God…

19
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,909
allows you to take what you want?!

20
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,570
Gomu Gomu No Bazooka

21
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,880
Gomu Gomu No Files

22
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:09,600
Luffy Falls!
The Divine Judgment and the Desire of Nami!!

23
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,490
The Arch was released from Vearth!

24
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,389
It goes up more and more high
! What will one make?

25
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,880
The Arch takes off in the sky!

26
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,880
You did it…

27
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,309
You did it!

28
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,180
You beat Eneru!

29
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,480
Mr.-MR.-but
the Arch…

30
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,890
The Arch continues to fly!

31
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,539
Impossible.

32
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,240
It is raised?

33
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,109
Poor insane.

34
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,700
C this…

35
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,089
Once removed from you,

36
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,500
I will be supreme.

37
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,180
Once again, all will fear me…

38
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,189
will adore me…

39
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,070
and will incline themselves in front of me!

40
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,430
It will be my world!

41
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,650
Those of your species cannot
not to hope to beat me!

42
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,850
For somebody like me,

43
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,320
nothing is impossible!

44
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,780
I AM VERY POWERFUL GOD!

45
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,780
Will run for your lives! Quickly!

46
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,700
Help me!

47
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,709
Look at!

48
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,650
There is something which floats in
airs above Upper yard!

49
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,660
U-Un boat?

50
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,709
It is impossible!

51
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,170
Ever intended to speak
of a flying boat!

52
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,600
Then this boat is the cause
darkening of the sky?

53
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,380
God must be on board!

54
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,830
He!

55
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,300
Hurry to escape to you!

56
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,470
ALL WITH THE BOATS!

57
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,700
There are many boats
who flee Angel Island.

58
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,199
What occurs?

59
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,030
What can it occur
under this black cloud?

60
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,490
Somebody approaches.

61
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,240
Populate Shandia!

62
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,370
Prepare your boats quickly!

63
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,089
This country is on
not to be destroyed!

64
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,190
What?

65
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,579
You must escape!

66
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,880
Towards the Blue Sea!

67
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,540
L it Blue Sea?!

68
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,880
An Arch…

69
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,970
Eneru God…

70
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,560
Now looks at, Man-Rubber band.

71
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,350
Look at the anguish of a condemned island.

72
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,900
The celestial island will perish…

73
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,200
and lives of the angels
will be reduced to nothing.

74
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,990
And nobody can stop me.

75
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,440
Even you!

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,579
Stop that!

77
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,360
GLOAM

78
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,709
The gold wall?!

79
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,250
Dumb!

80
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,549
PADDLING

81
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,740
C-CHAUD!

82
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,309
It mixed it with electricity?!

83
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,440
HEAT! It IS HOT, BROTHEL!

84
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,550
Luffy!

85
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,510
I cannot withdraw it!

86
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,220
Shit!

87
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,559
Man-rubber band of the Blue Sea.

88
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,230
I do not need to test
to beat me with you.

89
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,240
Remove to me that, dumb!

90
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,700
I would be negligent if I you
still let disturb my plans.

91
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,110
I believe…

92
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,200
how it is time to say good-bye!

93
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,920
This gold babiole will be
reward for your valiancy with the combat.

94
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,090
It is for you!

95
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,420
Luffy!

96
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,109
Without you,

97
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,560
I am again supreme!

98
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,870
No other mortal in the world
will not be able to beat me!

99
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,400
In the world?!

100
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,079
Be to you idiot or what?

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,530
There are heaps of guy
who can beat you!

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,630
It there more guys surpuissants on
the ocean in bottom which you cannot imagine it!

103
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,620
Somebody like you…

104
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,790
A kid who does not know
when to hold its language.

105
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,130
Now fall!

106
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,210
With the celestial island!

107
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,310
Somebody like you…

108
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,090
Oh not!

109
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,170
Luffy!

110
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,440
Luffy…

111
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,770
WHORE!

112
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
It is Luffy,
Bird-horse-chan!

113
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,820
Luffy falls!

114
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,449
It is…

115
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,369
Aisa and Pierre!

116
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,490
Then they are there.

117
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,210
In fact the voices
whistled around us.

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,550
FIGHT WITH ME!

119
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,630
Luffy, one comes to save you!

120
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,449
It is afflicting!

121
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,779
All that you will try will be futile!

122
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,309
Aisa! Pierre!

123
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,670
Made attention! Start from there!

124
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,480
ENERU!

125
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,060
The Divine Judgment!

126
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,050
EL THOR

127
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,190
LUFFY!

128
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,639
Aisa!

129
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,750
Pierre!

130
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,760
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

131
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,350
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

132
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,450
Luffy… Aisa…

133
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,119
A combatant until the end.

134
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,689
This elastic consistency…

135
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,489
Ca really posed problem to me.

136
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,700
But good, that returns to same.

137
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,660
It is so large!

138
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,630
This is the Arch that the Guards
were forced to build?

139
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,299
Just there.

140
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,759
The northern part of the island.

141
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,840
Once recovered gold,

142
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,300
we will find ourselves on the coast here.

143
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,020
Then, when everyone
will be there, we will be able to leave!

144
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,230
Of course, as long as the treasure
arrive over there, that suits me!

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,560

N-Nami-san…

146
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,399
They move towards the north-eastern coast,

147
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,489
to join their boat.

148
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,900
I will go over there and
I will await their arrival.

149
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,940
I must guide them with the Blue Sea!

150
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,660
I am the only one with being able them
to show the exit of the celestial island!

151
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,570
I must quickly reach the Merry Vogue!

152
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,879
I made a long dream.

153
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,210
Yes, I dreamed of you.

154
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,589
Ah, Nami-san…

155
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,929
I ate the fruit
interdict with you…

156
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,969
and we walked in the paradise.

157
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,679
Do not let to me awake.

158
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,309
I want to remain in this marvellous dream.

159
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,380
Just us two,
to never awake…

160
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,849
Ah, Nami-san…

161
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,970
What?

162
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,530
I wanted to remain in
my dream with Nami-san!

163
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,470
Nami-san?

164
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,480
Where is Nami-san?

165
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
Nami-san!

166
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,400
What…?

167
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,280
But it is what that?

168
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,659
“Mellorine… Mellorine… Mellorine…”

169
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,339
“Mellorine… Mellorine…”

170
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,169
“Mellorine! Mellorine! Mel…”

171
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,960
Nami-san!

172
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,500
What occurs?!

173
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,559
He! Upright, Usopp!

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,590
It is not the moment of
to sleep, draft!

175
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,760
It is for what?

176
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,149
Where am I?

177
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,970
Do not seek. Prepare it is all.

178
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,640
To prepare me?

179
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,770
We will save Nami-san!

180
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,989
To save?

181
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,440
To save…

182
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,449
Oh! I remember now! God!

183
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,940
God was there!

184
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,710
Oh shit!

185
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,170
It already left!

186
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,210
It had to capture Nami-san!

187
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,380
N-N-Nami
?

188
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,969
Make shit!

189
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,930
It is because of our uselessness
how it was captured!

190
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,430
Nami-san is so nice!

191
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,510
If she were kidnapped…

192
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,100
Where is it?

193
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,390
Up there!

194
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,859
What is this… that it is?!

195
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,610
An Arch… in the forest?!

196
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,280
Ca lasted only one moment,
but I know that I saw it!

197
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,329
Nami-san is on this Arch.

198
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,830
I insane of what it is!

199
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,789
And besides, Nami-san
its Tee-shirt did not carry!

200
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,200
Ca does not have ANYTHING to see!

201
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,709
I do not include/understand what occurs.

202
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,830
Where are Conis, the Knight
Odd, and others?

203
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,299
I do not know.

204
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,210
For the time being, we must make quickly!

205
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,189
O-where this is
that one goes, Sanji?!

206
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,269
On the Arch, obviously!

207
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,939
Q-what?!

208
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,190
If it still moves away, us
will not be able to go up any more above!

209
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,189
It is our only chance!

210
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,030
By chance, you imply that
I must also go up on board?

211
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,159
Absolutely!

212
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,779
You still have this invention, not?

213
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,119
The cord which leaves your size!

214
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,239
Ah yes, you want to say
“Usopp Ahhahhahh”?

215
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,579
Ouais! I go you it
to give and await you here…

216
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,829
Not question! Hurry!

217
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,669
Not! Have-await one second!

218
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,490
Cretin! There are not time!

219
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,499
I arrive!

220
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,050
Nami-swan!

221
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,849
With the Maxim Arch,
now airborne…

222
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,429
all tears and cries of the people…

223
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,130
will not save this country.

224
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,269
The celestial island will fall of the sky…

225
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,310
and me, Very Powerful God,

226
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,520
I will go up towards the ground
infinite, Fairy Vearth!

227
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,190
The Gold Maxim Arch, will carry out me over there!

228
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,530
Ah, yes. I should not forget.

229
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,580
There is a treasure which I owe
to acquire before my rise.

230
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,330
Pride of Shandia, one
gigantic gold bell.

231
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,709
And the formidable one
belfry which supports it.

232
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,339
I was interested by this belfry.

233
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,830
The Gold Bell.

234
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,800
Ca is appropriate to me perfectly, it
directing Paradise itself!

235
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,170
A colossal bell!

236
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,679
That there
does it have?

237
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,969
You managed for
to survive all this time.

238
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,380
Forget these lower imbeciles.

239
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,020
There is a future which you wish, not?

240
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,350
A future which I do wish?

241
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,260
Yes, I have one of them.

242
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,180
But, if I were to leave with you,

243
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,900
I would be alone.

244
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,249
Go up on board! Go up on board!

245
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,049
It is the midnight supper of the Gold Festival!

246
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,990
With us the treasure!!

247
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,049
GOLD!

248
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,350
GOLD!

249
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,950
Which is the interest
to have what I wish…

250
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,580
when I cannot it
to divide with anybody?

251
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,130
The truth, it is that there is a multitude
of thing which I want to make or to have.

252
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,100
But if I must give up these people
and outward journey with you to have them…

253
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,230
Then I do not want anything!

254
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,190
You do not want anything?

255
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,020
I suppose that includes your life.

256
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,279
What did it occur?

257
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,730
He, Suu!

258
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,369
Usopp-san and
Sanji-san…

259
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,910
should not move in
isn't their state?

260
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,660
What did it occur?

261
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,200
Why aren't they there?

262
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,330
Where are they?

263
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,799
How I can say that…

264
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,919
Ah, it is that!

265
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,549
Initially, the type with pretty
eyebrows awoke.

266
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,830
Sanji-san awoke…

267
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,149
and it awoke Usopp-san.

268
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,349
Then they all are
both put to run.

269
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,429
They left.

270
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,549
to go up on board flying arch.

271
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,349
They will jump…

272
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,450
up there?

273
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,729
What?! You want to say…

274
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,000
on the Arch?

275
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,809
These deux-là…

276
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,819
in their state…

277
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,680
It is delirious!

278
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,449
One really will try it?!

279
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,490
It is not question which we make
that through these strong winds!

280
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,080
I believe that I have a beginning of my disease
chronicle I--can-not-outward journey-in-height…

281
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,370
He, I will spin you this trick, and
you will be able to go there all alone…

282
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,410
Stop feeling sorry for you!

283
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,999
Now!

284
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,950
Do it!

285
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,090
Do not reproach me anything!

286
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,930
Go!

287
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,530
I would qualify with difficulty
that of intelligent decision.

288
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,820
You now lost
your only chance of survival.

289
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,610
If you do not wish
to remain on board this vessel,

290
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,690
then you have only one
only possible destination.

291
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,539
It is…

292
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,940
a forthcoming life.

293
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,720
Not! Not! I
do not want! Save me!

294
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,599
THE FARM!

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,580
Yes, Mister!

296
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,809
He, Usopp!

297
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,640
Do not lower your guard!

298
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,060
STUPID EGGPLANT SPECIES!

299
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,119
Usopp Ahhhh…!

300
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,579
Ahhhh…!

301
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,730
Go!

302
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,789
I of insane who you would be a god.

303
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,830
If you installations would not be this
that a finger on Nami-san,

304
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,160
I will become the Demon of the Blue Sea!

305
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,840
NAMI-SWAAAN!

306
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,889
I will put my heart and my body at it.

307
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,600
Even if I must use each piece
of my intelligence and my body…

308
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,430
I will survive it!

309
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,899
Once again…

310
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,690
Yes, to sail on the sea with
everyone, once again!

311
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,539
Luffy…

312
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,580
I will borrow you your courage!

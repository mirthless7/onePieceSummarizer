1
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,299
The attack of Eneru
continue with eagerness,

2
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,250
attacking the island of
Very whole Skypiea.

3
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,969
All this is only one affront!

4
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,579
People, trees and ground!

5
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,039
It is necessary that they turn over to their place!

6
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,090
They will become a rain which
will fall down on the Blue Sea!

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,470
Quickly!

8
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,810
Angel Island is on
the point to sink!

9
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,650
There is no shelter on this island!

10
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,830
During this time, Robin and Usopp
are still with the feet of Giant Jack.

11
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,490
It already took much altitude.

12
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,669
In little time, the arch
the summit of bean will have reached.

13
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,669
What can seek Eneru well up there?

14
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,129
He wants the Gold Bell hidden in top.

15
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,320
A bell?

16
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,309
This old Divine Sanctuary
is not useful to me any more with nothing.

17
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,840
Nor the city of Shandora in lower part!

18
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,900
There is from now on only one
thing which interests me in this country!

19
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,860
The Large Gold Belfry!

20
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,159
Luffy, with the continuation of Eneru,

21
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,659
sink towards the summit of Giant Jack.

22
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,780
Nami, I hope that you are well!

23
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,560
And I will not leave you
to take the Gold Bell, Eneru!

24
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:45,490
Destruction of Angel Island!
 Terrifying descent of Raigou!!

25
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,770
The Gold Bell.

26
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,989
It is what you have just said, not?

27
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,979
Wiper…

28
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,470
Yes.

29
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,650
About what you do speak?

30
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,830
Just before it touches you with his electricity,
you spoke as if you knew what he wanted.

31
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,120
Isn't Eneru wants, it?

32
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,169
Where is it?

33
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,129
He, wait!

34
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,379
There are not time to speak about that!

35
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,080
You saw these flashes, not?!

36
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,170
If one does not draw
now, one died!

37
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,840
At the top of this giant bean.

38
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,889
How?

39
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,309
How do you know it?

40
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,870
He!

41
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,680
One promised in Nami to wait
its return on the boat!

42
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,729
It will bring back Luffy and us
to join in little time!

43
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,470
It rightly, Wiper.

44
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,529
Ruins of Shandora
are right in lower part.

45
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,690
This bean transpierced it
ground right in the middle of the city.

46
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,159
He, look at! He!

47
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,449
Ruins, finally I
do not know what it was,

48
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,280
but there remain only crumbs about it!

49
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,570
And it is exactly what
be likely to arrive to us!

50
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,669
The heart of the city…

51
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,339
it is there that drew up the Large one
Belfry, supporting the Gold Bell.

52
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,370
It was registered on a chart
that I found in the ruins.

53
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,210
You are unaware of me completely?

54
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,389
To make simple,

55
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,099
I believe that the force of
impact with bean…

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,720
the Bell high in the sky propelled.

57
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,800
It is just above us?

58
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,720
Song of the island!

59
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,800
He, Ho!

60
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,950
Then there is a large bell
in is the Gold City, it that?

61
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,469
Good, I reached it
top of Giant Jack.

62
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,680
Naturally, I never needed
to explore the sky above the Divine Sanctuary.

63
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,679
It has been there for 400 years.

64
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,510
Then, where is it?

65
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,300
The Gold Bell.

66
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,110
It is what this place?

67
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,040
Still him?

68
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,790
I did not expect that it there
arrive with this weight at the end of its arm.

69
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,679
Ah!

70
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,340
Te here!

71
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,219
Do not move!

72
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,170
Eneru!

73
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,430
Little runt.

74
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,749
Wiper, which do you make?

75
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,450
Do not say to me that you go
to climb on Giant Jack!

76
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,410
The guy, you move away from bean!

77
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,500
Something falls!

78
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,719
The top of bean!

79
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,019
That it is
passed up there?

80
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,179
He Ho!

81
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,399
I hope that Luffy and Nami
did not fall with!

82
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,850
Wiper!

83
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,429
Not! Wait!

84
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,339
You are too weak!

85
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,109
Look at yourself!

86
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,069
And even if you succeeded,

87
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,159
you could never
to reach Eneru because it flies!

88
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,310
It is…

89
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,530
It is just above us!

90
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,080
The Bell that the Large Warrior
Karugara wanted to sound!

91
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,980
Karugara?

92
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,330
Yes.

93
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,000
It is for that we are there!

94
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,169
Eneru…

95
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,130
I will not let to you take it!

96
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,650
Now, how you count
to go up up to now?

97
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,770
Puffiness!

98
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,240
Remainder one moment.

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,620
You will be likely to assist
with something the miraculous one.

100
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,840
It is what that?

101
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,479
Ah ouais…

102
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,890
I would do better
to benefit from its absence!

103
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,560
It is my only chance!

106

Brilliant, my plan went!

107
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,840
Now it is necessary that
I go up on this arch!

108
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,349
Luffy!

109
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,899
I finally found you!

110
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,270
Nami? What do you make there?

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,359
I came to seek you.

112
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,270
It is thanks to Sanji-kun and Usopp
that I am in life, they saved me.

113
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,859
It is true?

114
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,069
I see!

115
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,350
They is super!

116
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,110
More important…

117
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,850
Wait…

118
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,450
What is it?

119
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,910
The clouds of flashes change form.

120
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,079
Sky!

121
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,540
The Help!!

122
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,589
Oh not!

123
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,389
With the assistance!

124
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,370
Will run!

125
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,790
That
it passes?!

126
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,679
Embark!

127
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,420
Quickly, everyone on board!

128
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,810
A giant ball floats in the sky!

129
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
I have a bad presentiment.

130
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,270
Interior of this sphere
clouds of flashes…

131
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,480
is a concentrate of air
and of electricity!

132
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,080
It is just above Angel Island!

133
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,330
It gathered the clouds
flashes in a sphere.

134
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,469
It is a demon!

135
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,540
This trick is not natural!

136
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,719
But that…

137
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,840
seek it with
to make up there?

138
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,040
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

139
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,340
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

140
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,990
He, let pass to me!

141
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,530
Await me!

142
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,289
The sky belongs to me!

143
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,160
You for known as hold!

144
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,590
With my capacities and those
Maxim Arch, combined…

145
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,380
I have the power of a god!

146
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,509
It is what?

147
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,840
Ca will fall on Angel Island!

148
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,189
It is too late!

149
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,189
We did not succeed!

150
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,609
Flee!!

151
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,520
I am afraid!

152
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,990
[Note:spiritual guide of the thunder]

153
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,019
What? It is not true!

154
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,489
Did the White Berets flee?

155
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,529
The White Berets saved us.

156
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,350
Our island…

157
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,310
Our fatherland completely disappeared!

158
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,280
The island…

159
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,040
was disintegrated!

160
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,420
Which spectacular sight.

161
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,750
The sky should resemble that.

162
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,010
Was C-C' what this explosion?

163
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,559
And then…

164
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,720
continuous rain of flashes!

165
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,930
J I believe that one will not leave oneself there!

166
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,569
Angel Island…

167
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,270
was destroyed…

168
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,610
Which horror…

169
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,820
What a terrible cruelty, Eneru!

170
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,870
All trembles so violently.

171
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,330
I must wait.

172
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,880
I must help them with
to turn over on the Blue Sea.

173
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,809
Luffy, goes up!

174
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,870
We must go down again!

175
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,889
The others are already
turned over to the boat!

176
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,130
We must go there us too!

177
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,210
Not.

178
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,109
Not? What do you want to say?

179
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,359
What do you say?

180
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
Even if I should save you…

181
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,529
There remains to me a business to be regulated!

182
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,529
A business to be regulated? Can one know
what do you intend to make?

183
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,190
You do not have nevertheless the intention
to face Eneru again?

184
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,480
The Gold Bell is there, in the sky!

185
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,749
Gold? But…

186
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,999
our lives are more important!

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,070
Look at over there!

188
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,459
Even if its flashes
do not function on you,

189
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,450
it can nevertheless all destroy!

190
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,379
If it is the gold which you want, looks at!

191
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,250
You have some in quantity at the end of the arm!

192
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,759
Forget the Gold Bell!

193
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,590
You will die!

194
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,059
I will not die.

195
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,809
Ca is enough! Go…

196
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,260
You saw it you too!

197
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,300
About what you do speak?

198
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,019
The Gold City!

199
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,680
The Gold City exists indeed!

200
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,610
It was not a lie!

201
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,110
The ancestor of Papi
Head-of-diamond…

202
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,709
If it exists, it is so much better.

203
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,530
But if it does not exist,
it is so much better too.

204
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,040
My goal is not
to prove its innocence.

205
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,840
It is right a duel with
that which ruined my life.

206
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,210
… was not a liar.

207
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,210
Then this Papi and monkeys in
low must know the truth!

208
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,380
The Gold City is in the sky!

209
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,810
If I make sound the bell…

210
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,850
They will hear it.

211
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,399
Without that, this Papi and these guys…

212
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,650
will continue to explore it
ocean floor and to die about it!

213
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,570
Luffy…

214
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,950
I cannot let Eneru take it!

215
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,750
The sound of this enormous bell will be enough
powerful to be heard of anywhere!

216
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,549
It is for that I go…

217
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,410
to make sound the Gold Bell!

218
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,929
He, Ho!

219
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,630
Then there is a large bell
in is the Gold City, it that?

220
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,469
According to the newspaper of
edge of Norland, yes.

221
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,300
He wrote well that it existed.

222
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,099
What of other?

223
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,760
Why you requests?

224
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,430
I have a super idea!

225
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,520
What? It is what your idea?

226
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,279
If one makes sound this enormous bell…

227
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,480
Can be that Papi Head-of-Diamond
and the monkeys will hear it!

228
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,990
Ouais! They will hear it, not truth?

229
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,200
When he says that he will make
something, it does it.

230
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,370
You think that it goes…

231
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,919
Indeed he said it.

232
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,290
But under these conditions…

233
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,710
To sound.

234
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,420
To make sound the Bell?

235
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,599
Ouais.

236
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,179
Even if Nami tries to bring back it.

237
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,680
It will not follow it.

238
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,510
He wants the same thing as Eneru.

239
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,180
I have it!

240
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,320
Who gave you the permission
to go up on my Arch?

241
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,110
Eneru!

242
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,839
Luffy!

243
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,170
I said to you to drop!

244
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,500
This dumb!

245
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,349
Was this spectacular?

246
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,800
You saw this pathetic island
to disappear from the skies?

247
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,440
Gamine, if you always wish
to accompany me towards Fairy Vearth,

248
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,930
I would not show any leniency.

249
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,939
Rather to die!

250
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,699
When I obtain what I wish,

251
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,200
I would use second Raigou for
to destroy Skypiea very whole!

252
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,240
None among you will escape from it!

253
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,800
Neither you, nor those of which I
still perceive the bass voices!

254
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,620
Bass voices?

255
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,790
This country which does not have its
place here will be destroyed!

256
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,050
All will take again its legitimate place!

257
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,510
It is…

258
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,470
It is the mission of God! My mission!

259
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,350
I will leave you…

260
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,220
PAS FAIRE!!!

261
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,829
Good-bye, man-rubber!

262
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,530
Thus wisely death waits!

263
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,780
Luffy!

264
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,960
Luffy!

265
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,810
Nobody can stop me.

266
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,680
Brothel!

267
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,190
Listen, I promise you
to send on the celestial island!

268
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,940
Luffy…

269
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,070
I GO…

270
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,790
TO MAKE SOUND THIS BELL!

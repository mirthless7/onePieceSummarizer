1
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:10,870
To believe in the dream of our companions!

2
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:10,870
Battle with the taupinière 4th Avenue

3
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,410
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,780
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,200
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,380
Seriously wounded, Karu took Vivi on its back.

7
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,020
Dodging the attacks of Mr. 2,

8
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,780
they run through the battle which makes rage between the rebels and the royal army,

9
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,040
and move directly towards the palate of Alubarna.

10
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,210
But Karu is touched by a stray bullet, and fall to ground.

11
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,710
Mr. 2 approaches quickly…

12
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,190
but the squadron of the Super-Mallards and Sanji come to the rescue!

13
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,500
During this time, with the South-eastern door,

14
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,210
Chopper and Usopp started the combat against Miss Merry Christmas and Mr. 4.

15
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,620
It is over there?

16
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,280
When it succeeded in escaping?

17
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,800
This form…

18
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,580
Oh, I see, Zoan.

19
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,960
I knew that it was not human normal!

20
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,540
You are well, Usopp?

21
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,840
Thank you…

22
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,260
You saved me the life.

23
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,530
And then?

24
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,420
That will not change the fact that we have the advantage.

25
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,310
Allons-y, Mr. 4!

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,530
Allons-y!

27
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:11,950
One goes there!

28
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,620
Go!

29
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,200
Molasse species!

30
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,700
Mola…!

31
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,580
Mol-! Mol-!

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,680
They turn over under ground!

33
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,320
Usopp, remember that if you stop moving, you died.

34
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,040
I know.

35
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,090
If we stop moving, they can canarder with their bend us!

36
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:30,990
Ca arrives!

37
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,720
If I get rid of you…!

38
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
I hold you!

39
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
Wouldn't the play be also funny without beater, maintaining they are good?

40
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,200
CHOPPER!

41
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,280
I had forgotten that I could do that.

42
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,730
Dirtiness of old crone!

43
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,440
Species of…!

44
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,510
Shit…

45
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,660
If they continue to hide in these holes of moles,

46
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,740
even if I use Rumble Ball, I will not stop running to them afterwards.

47
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,280
Euh?

48
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,820
What?

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,660
Where it disappeared?

50
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,340
This long nose!

51
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,550
It rightly. Usopp left!

52
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,230
I have something to say to you to both!

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,600
You did beautiful work by digging all these tunnels!

54
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,350
Beautiful job!

55
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,890
But there is a large fault in your strategy.

56
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,060
Where are you?

57
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,190
Where you are!?

58
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,450
Wait…

59
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,490
It is that! There is full, of these goods small tunnels!

60
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,360
And you them guy…

61
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,480
do not be the only ones with being able to use them.

62
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,600
Dumb!

63
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,440
He was in one of the tunnels!

64
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,940
Mr. 4!

65
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,360
One…

66
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,210
A hammer of 5 tons!?

67
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,130
Where this guy acquired the capacity to use a trick like that!?

68
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:48,990
5 tons…

69
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,020
Q- Who devil are you?

70
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,300
I sailed on the seas of the world…

71
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,350
destroying all the enemies being on my way.

72
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,190
I could not count the number of ships which I ran.

73
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,060
People fear me and call me…

74
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,300
the Prince of the Destruction.

75
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,190
Remember my name well.

76
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,680
CAPTAIN USOPP!

77
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,560
Super! Incredible!

78
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,410
Impressing!

79
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,070
Extra!

80
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,420
Oh, thank you!

81
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:19,940
Super!

82
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,820
But…

83
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,290
Thank you, baby!

84
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,660
But…

85
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,560
Thank you, goodbye!

86
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,440
But…

87
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,260
I…

88
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,850
I will sign autographs later.

89
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,770
I always thought that you were weak until now!

90
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,270
He.

91
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,970
Mr. 4 was…!

92
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,640
He does not move?

93
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,440
Did I really hurt him?

94
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,260
B- Well. In isn't all the cases, it is my chance?

95
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,210
It is your turn, the penguin!

96
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,620
Prepare to taste the 5 tons of my hammer!

97
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,810
She escaped…

98
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,500
Where are you, penguin!?

99
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,460
I am a mole, cretin degenerated!

100
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,170
!

101
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,120
Stop… moving…!

102
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,350
Ba! Ba species!

103
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,910
If that cannot touch me…

104
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,550
… then this trick is useless!

105
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,340
Let to me say a thing…

106
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,720
I am sure that you listened to the agents of Works Baroque which underwent a defeat vis-a-vis us.

107
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,540
And that which all overcame them…

108
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,720
… it was me!

109
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,100
Q- What!?

110
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,020
And moreover…

111
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,330
I have 8.000 disciples!

112
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,000
REALLY!?

113
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,530
5 tons!

114
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,040
Whoa! Impressing!

115
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,040
5 tons!

116
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,600
Whoa! Impressing!

117
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,170
5 tons!

118
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,200
Whoa!

119
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,650
5 tons!

120
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,010
Impressing!

121
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,010
5 tons!

122
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,360
Whoa!

123
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,360
5 tons!

124
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,880
Impress-!

125
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,420
O---W---W---W--- !

126
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,150
It has badly that now?!

127
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,590
But it was struck by a hammer of 5 tons!

128
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,150
It is a monster!

129
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,750
It does not even have a bump…

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,660
Not even a scratch after having taken a hammer of 5 tons on the head?

131
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,060
Paperboard!?

132
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
Was He, it a forgery!?

133
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,880
Of course how it was a forgery!

134
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
How you would like that I raise 5 tons!?

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,090
I give up already after 5 kilos!

136
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,710
It is a portable foldable model…

137
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,180
… I did it with two stoves and a stick!

138
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,490
What? You are foutu of me!?

139
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,010
I will not retain any more my blows, henceforth!

140
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,540
It is turned over in the taupinière…

141
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,090
Pay attention to the holes!

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,570
Q- What will it make, this time?

143
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
Where you are, collapsing?!

144
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,240
Where devil are you!?

145
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,020
To pay attention to the holes?

146
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,750
How you can be pathetic!

147
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,350
The ground is like a swimming pool for me!

148
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,880
A swimming pool?

149
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,900
In it is able…

150
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,600
Usopp!

151
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,100
Mr. 4, Lasso.

152
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,350
You two, take care of this Man-Reindeer.

153
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,760
Make him the blow of the 400 balls!

154
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:12,860
They are not good.

155
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,540
We will not be able to hold vis-a-vis such attacks!

156
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,880
I must try my chance, and all to bet over the three next minutes…

157
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,290
I must find a means of overcoming them!

158
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,900
Kohza…

159
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,980
Where… you are?

160
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,630
Do you include/understand?

161
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,630
A country, it is people.

162
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,910
Father…

163
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,590
Isn't the rebellion can still be stopped?

164
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,050
Vivi-Chan?

165
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,710
All that you want, it is that nobody dies in this combat.

166
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,030
Is it a joke?

167
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,380
People die.

168
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
Stop speaking like that!

169
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,530
If you are the only hope to stop the rebellion…

170
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,370
… then you must remain in life at all costs.

171
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,040
And now, no matter what it arrives to us, that will not have any importance!

172
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,170
The guy, leave in front!

173
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,770
We will await you Alubarna!

174
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,440
Ouais!

175
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,510
It is this kingdom of no importance…

176
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,560
… which will die.

177
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,540
I will stop that!

178
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,680
What imports what I must do!

179
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,220
Chopper?

180
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,240
Chopper.

181
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,950
It is not the moment to worry for someone else!

182
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,680
Where?

183
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,090
Hadn't I said you that I was not going from now on any more to retain my blows?

184
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,020
Ba species…!

185
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,110
I will strike you as much as I will want it.

186
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,440
And then I will let you dry in the desert!

187
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,950
I arrive!

188
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,850
There are rules which prohibit to strike a man here!

189
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,880
Thus keep silent yourself, Ba species!

190
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,790
Yes! There are walls over there in the ruins!

191
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,770
If we continue at this speed, then when one arrives over there…

192
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,580
it will crash to pieces the head on the buried part of the wall!

193
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,570
Come there…

194
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,410
Come there…

195
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,290
Come there…

196
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,180
Come there!

197
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,770
Crash to pieces yourself the head!

198
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,680
Usopp?

199
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,920
Usopp…

200
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,490
I will not have soon enough any more of time!

201
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,640
Rumble Ball will make effect only during two more minutes!

202
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,520
All will go well for Usopp!

203
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,230
He will not die like that!

204
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,300
Now, I must find their weakness!

205
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,650
If not it is finished by it us!

206
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,040
It is true.

207
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,230
It is Usopp which said it to me!

208
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,340
Now…

209
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,210
I must do what I have to do!

210
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,000
I think that this penguin was crushed!
Too much naze!

211
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,680
I said that I was a mole!

212
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,770
Help me!

213
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,170
Go!

214
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,090
Stop!

215
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,160
They is dangerous!

216
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
If you go also quickly…
in a place like that…!

217
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,980
Look in front! A wall!

218
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,810
A wall in front!

219
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,450
A wall in front!
Don't you see the wall?

220
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,860
DECREE!

221
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,630
I see!

222
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,980
I see your weakness!

223
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:50,570
Now!

224
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,740
USOPP!

225
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,750
Usopp, can you rise?

226
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,180
Usopp!?

227
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,040
Huh?

228
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,450
The taupinière! Moved away from the holes!

229
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,100
You will not need to say it to me second once!

230
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,670
Quickly!

231
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,290
What did they envisage?

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,400
Q- What?

233
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,880
The weakness of the taupinière…

234
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,340
… it is that all the tunnels are connected.

235
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,230
Oh?

236
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,150
Wow.

237
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,970
They are in life?

238
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,310
They is bad.

239
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,060
I already used half of the effects of Rumble Ball!

240
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,410
Not…

241
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,410
What?

242
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,220
Not more! Not more, or I will die!

243
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,070
Usopp!

244
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,330
Insane Es you? One is likely no to gain!

245
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,230
These monsters are still in life after all that!

246
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,490
Do not do that! You will not be able to escape to them while fleeing!

247
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,850
USOPP!

248
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,550
You should listen to your friend!

249
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,500
This pretty small explosion really irritated me!

250
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,670
You do not have any chance to escape to me also easily after that!

251
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,330
USOPP!

252
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,800
The captain is weak, then it is not a surprise if its crew is weak also.

253
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,040
Captain?

254
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,070
What arrived at Luffy?

255
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,850
Luffy with the straw hat was already killed.

256
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,420
The Boss is occupied.

257
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,270
The rebellion left and started without him.

258
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,620
Eh well, its adversary was quite simply too weak.

259
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,530
Did Luffy… die?

260
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,620
Do not say anything!!

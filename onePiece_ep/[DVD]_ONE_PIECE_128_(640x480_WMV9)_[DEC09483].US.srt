1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,880
The world...

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Yes!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Seek freedom,

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,940
And your world will stand stretched out before your eyes.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
If the endless dream guides your spirits,

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Conquer it!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
Bear conviction behind your flag!

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,200
I began my search,With a blast of water,

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
Toward a boundless,everlasting world

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,710
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,140
Seeking the light l've never seen

12
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,850
When the summer-colored sun shakes the sall of my heart,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,950
It's a sign the door to a new world has opened

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,750
Swaying between the waves, I can escape despair,

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,500
For the horize on the other side is what I aim for!

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I began my search, With a blast of water,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
Toward a boundless, everlasting world

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,940
With this overflowing passion in my chest, I'll go anywhere

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,190
Seeking the light I've never seen

20
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:59,410
Pirates' party
Alabasta escape strategy!

21
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,930
Quite a fascinating mixture you're making.

22
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,400
Quite original, and yet...

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,760
So superbly logical.

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,070
Wherever did you learn such exquisite medicinal skill?

25
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,990
Tony-kun is a doctor from Drum Island.

26
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,550
My word! I see!

27
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,760
A doctor from the Great Medical Country of Drum!

28
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,370
Ho-ho!

29
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,230
So they are still ahead of the rest of us!

30
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,540
I've been a doctor for 40 years now,

31
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,680
And I had no idea such medical techniques existed!

32
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,570
My, this is truly exquisite.

33
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,250
You're so young and I can't even help you in the slightest!

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,090
Shut up!

35
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,970
Quit starting at me! Moron!

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,900
Get the hell away from me, asshole!

37
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,460
Can I take that to mean:
"Please, have some tea and observe all you like"?

38
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,610
I think so!

39
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,470
Goodness! This is so extraordinary!

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,020
Shut up...

41
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,040
You are so talented!

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,010
I'm extremely impressed!

43
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,710
Shut up and get the hell away from me, asshole!

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,270
Oi!

45
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,000
There any spare timber around?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,360
I need some too!

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,620
I've got plenty! Take it!

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,640
Ah! Thanks!

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,690
This is a strong country.

50
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,390
'Cause their Princess is so cute!

51
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,450
What does that have to do with it?

52
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,190
Everything!

53
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,960
Dammit!

54
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,090
Something broke through the walls between our houses!

55
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,350
What the HELL made these holes!?

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,450
It's like someone just kicked their way through!

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,350
There's no time to go around!

58
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,600
Shortcut!

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,210
Look at the damage...

60
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,550
Oi, Usopp! Look at that!

61
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,800
There's something happening over there.

62
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,460
Concentrate...

63
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,830
If I can't call forth that power at any point in time,

64
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,260
I will not have become stronger.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,260
There are so many interesting books here!

66
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,090
Can I really have these?

67
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes, of course.

68
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
I have read them all already.

69
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,430
Thank you!

70
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,460
I'll take you up on that.

71
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,700
Did you not hear me say that we know nothing?

72
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,420
Now leave!

73
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,810
Lying will serve no purpose to your country!

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,680
Harboring pirates is a serious crime!

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,060
Keep up the good work.

76
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
Ha, welcome back.

77
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,820
Given the state of the city,

78
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,260
We're lucky we were able to buy this much!

79
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,080
Yeah!

80
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,290
Do you have any proof that we are harboring pirates here?

81
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,950
Well... we...

82
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,480
I wonder if he's woken up yet.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,230
If he had, we'd have heard him by now.

84
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,520
WHAT A GREAT NAP!

85
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,330
Where's Hat?

86
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,640
Hat! Where's my hat?

87
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,070
I'm hungry...

88
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,280
Where's breakfast? Hey, breakfast?

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,140
Hat? Breakfast? Hat?

90
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,860
You're noisy as hell when you wake up!

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,630
And it's not breakfast! It's already evening.

92
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,450
And your hat's over there.

93
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,190
A soldier found it in front of the Palace.

94
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,800
Phew, great!

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,150
I'm so glad, Luffy-san!

96
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,380
You've regained your strength!

97
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,080
Regained my strength?

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,790
But I'm always strong.

99
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,950
You idiot!

100
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,920
You were really sick with a temperature y'know!

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,080
Vivi and Chopper have been nursing you back to health this whole time!

102
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,110
Really?

103
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,190
Thanks!

104
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,320
Oh, Luffy, you're awake.

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,690
Oh, Zoro! Long time no see!

106
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,680
Long time no see?

107
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,780
Ah, HEY!

108
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,660
You better not have been out training again!

109
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,290
What? I can do what I want.

110
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,380
No means no!

111
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,620
I'm the ship's doctor! Don't take your bandages off!

112
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,150
They make it hard to move.

113
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,230
Then don't move!

114
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,900
Long time no see?

115
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,830
Long time no see?

116
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,430
Well, it's no wonder you feel that way.

117
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,480
You've been sleeping for three days straight.

118
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,210
Three days!?

119
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,740
I was asleep for three days!?

120
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah.

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,780
I've missed 15 meals.

122
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,060
Why are you so fast at calculating that!?

123
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,040
And you counted five meals a day!

124
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,730
So the Captain is awake?

125
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,770
Dinner's in 30 minutes. Does he mind waiting?

126
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,430
WHA-!?

127
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,540
Oooh! The Chikuwa Ossan! You're alive!

128
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,880
I-I knew you were really into that kinda shit!

129
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,300
No, everyone!

130
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,850
This is Terracotta-san.

131
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,720
She's Igaram's wife and the Palace's top chef!

132
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,950
You all took care of Vivi-sama and my husband!

133
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,550
You're kidding me...

134
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,220
A couple can only be so much alike...

135
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,210
I've heard you eat a lot.

136
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,630
Do you think you could snack on this fruit until dinnertime?

137
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,330
Okay.

138
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,070
WAS THAT SOME TRICK!?

139
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,230
Obachan, I'm gonna eat three days worth of food!

140
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,450
I was hoping you'd say that!

141
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,880
I've been a chef for 30 years!

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,430
I won't lose to some youngster's stomach, so eat all you can!

143
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,130
Absolutely no manners...

144
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,290
The Grand Dinning Hall should be quieter than this!

145
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,240
He meant what he said, but I'm not done yet!

146
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,930
Eat fast or he'll-

147
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,290
Dammit Luffy! You just took that off my plate!

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,930
Don't stretch!

149
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,840
Oi, oi, you shouldn't eat that fast!

150
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,190
There's plenty more!

151
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,210
Take this, Luffy. My Super Tabasco Boshi!

152
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,990
Where did you come from!?

153
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,750
What do you call this dish?

154
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,630
This is Kenafa. You put the noodles in the oven and...

155
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,630
Kenafa - unsalted, soft cheese which melts easily

156
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,020
Yummy!

157
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,960
Here's the next course!

158
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,230
Osshan, youb da Kigh?
(Ossan, you're the King?)

159
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,200
Ho, yo mas he Bibiz fad.
(So, you must be Vivi's dad.)

160
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,010
Wight?
(Right?)

161
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,040
Well, we can just talk after dinner...

162
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,740
Ogei, sor.
(Okay, sure.)

163
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,500
Can I get some more beer here!?

164
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,910
We need some water over here!

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,330
What a boisterous meal...

166
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,250
I can't stand to watch. It's too disgusting!

167
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm amazed Vivi-sama is able to laugh at all this...

168
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,730
This is the Palace's esteemed bathhouse.

169
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,860
We're only really able to use it when it rains.

170
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,780
Amazing! Gorgeous, gorgeous!

171
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,820
I'M GONNA BE FIRST!

172
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,870
NO, ME!

173
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,400
You guys having fun?

174
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,030
Well, that meal was certainly enjoyable.

175
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,320
I usually dine in a neat and tidy manner...

176
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,170
But it seems everything around you turns into a party.

177
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,970
Oi, Zoro, look at us!

178
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,380
We're training!

179
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,420
Training, training!

180
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,280
That's training!?

181
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,760
So? Where's the women's bath?

182
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,750
You ignoramus!

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,780
I would not tell someone like YOU!

184
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,190
Vivi-sama is in there!

185
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,510
Don't be so stingy!

186
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,740
It's right over that wall!

187
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,380
YOUR MAJESTY, YOU BASTARD!!

188
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,450
Ooh! I like your style!

189
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,720
This feels so good!

190
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,500
I wonder if any ships out there have baths this big on them!

191
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,450
I'm sure there are!

192
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,990
The sea is so vast!

193
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,250
We're seen Giants, Dinosaurs...

194
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,500
Sakura bloom in a land of snow...

195
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,480
The sea must contain so many more unimaginable things!

196
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,550
Um, that...

197
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,340
Switch.

198
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,330
Thank you.

199
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,240
Wait a minute, what are you all doing up there!?

200
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,520
Those guys...

201
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,310
Alright, it'll be 100,000 beri each.

202
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,860
「HAPPINESS PUNCH!」

203
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,430
NAMI-SAN!

204
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,230
Mellorine~! 

205
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,380
I suppose you're wondering.

206
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,170
We're thinking of leaving tonight.

207
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:36,950
Really!?

208
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,540
There's no reason for us to be here anymore, is there? Our Captain is awake.

209
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,180
And the Marines are probably in the harbor.

210
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,160
Our ship's gonna be in danger.

211
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,920
Thank you.

212
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,070
Dirty old man.

213
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,360
Not for that!

214
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,270
For this country.

215
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,080
Oi, oi. You sure you should be doing that? A king doing that...

216
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,450
This is no small matter, Cobra-sama!

217
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,320
A king should not lower his head to others!

218
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,100
Igaram.

219
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,870
Power is something worn over clothing.

220
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,640
But... this is a bath.

221
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,270
There is no such thing as a naked king.

222
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,180
As a father, and as a man who lives on this land,

223
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,850
I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude.

224
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Thank you.

225
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,580
Thank you so much.

226
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,750
Tonight?

227
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,380
Yep.

228
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,040
So we're leaving?

229
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,130
Well, I think we should too.

230
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,630
No reason to stick around here any longer.

231
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,180
Yeah, the Marines are starting to get bolder with their approaches.

232
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,940
Yosh! Luffy, you decide.

233
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,200
Yosh! We're leaving after one more Arabasta banquet!

234
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,470
We're leaving NOW, numbskull!

235
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,180
Bake! Ba-! Ba-!

236
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,790
What should we do, Igaram-san?

237
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,900
We must tell them immediately!

238
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,510
Yes, of course...

239
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,090
But... this is such a disastrous event...

240
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,960
I only hope they are able to leave the island safely.

241
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,750
This has happened all too fast!

242
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,200
Roronoa Zoro, Bounty: 60,000,000 beri

243
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,570
Monkey D. Luffy, Bounty: 100,000,000 beri

244
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,360
Igaram-san...

245
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,590
With this much on their heads,

246
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,040
Even the Marine Headquarters Admirals will move against them.

247
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,050
There's no turning back now, Luffy-kun...

248
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,320
You and your crew have taken down one of the Shichibukai!

249
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,180
TERRIBLE NEWS!

250
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,400
Vivi-sama!

251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,430
Where are they?

252
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,470
What's wrong, Igaram?

253
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,840
You seem upset.

254
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,670
Where have Luffy-kun and the others gone?

255
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,250
To the sea.

256
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,930
They're pirates.

257
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,540
But...

258
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,610
Listen up you guys. Pirates really suck.

259
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,460
Marine Headquarters Private Recruit 

260
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,540
Oi, oi, what're you saying?

261
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,420
Marine Headquarters Private Recruit 

262
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,270
Did you forget or something? You used to be... a pirate!

263
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,180
Crap!

264
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,890
Yeah, you're right!

265
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,980
Shall we dance, Baby!?

266
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,470
LET'S DANCE!

267
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,550
It seems the two of them have returned with a captured enemy ship.

268
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,490
Took them long enough.

269
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,380
What have they been doing?

270
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,680
I left them in charge of the ship in mid-attack, and this is how they repay me.

271
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
I'm unhappy. Hina unhappy.

272
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,970
Have all ships been deployed?

273
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,780
Yes, Ma'am! All of them!

274
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,790
All the docks in Arabasta have been blockaded by our 30-ship fleet with reinforcements!

275
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,250
But...

276
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
There is one thing that worries me.

277
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,090
What?

278
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,780
The vessel belonging to the Straw Hat Pirates that was sighted at Erumalu is gone.

279
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,640
You're telling me they've already fled the country?

280
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,380
No, that couldn't have happened, but-

281
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,790
Then find it!

282
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,930
Search coast to coast!

283
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,100
Yes Ma'am! At once!

284
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,450
Honestly...

285
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,470
Hina-jou!

286
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,160
We are late!

287
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,310
Please ask us why we are late.

288
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,750
Why are you late?

289
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,130
We picked flowers, just for you~!

290
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,080
I don't want them.

291
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,930
Return to your positions!

292
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,890
We're going after the Straw Hat Pirates!

293
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,490
S-STRAW HAT!?

294
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,010
I like this!

295
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,590
Farewell, oh country of sand!

296
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,430
Oi, Luffy, you still eating?

297
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,470
Arabasta food is the best!

298
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,050
Sanji, make some of this tomorrow!

299
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,050
Sure, I was interested in it too.

300
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,040
I got some recipes off Terracotta-san.

301
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,330
And I picked up some spices too.

302
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,630
Nami, are you feeling sick?

303
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,520
Nami, want a piece of meat?

304
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,440
But only one.

305
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,800
Nami-san, it's about Vivi-chan, isn't it?

306
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,430
I understand how you feel...

307
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,550
But if you keep thinking so much, you'll never get over it.

308
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,630
You two were good friends for so long...

309
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,110
But c'mon, look up.

310
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,310
I'm...

311
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,420
...giving it up.

312
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,030
For Vivi.

313
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,220
My 1,000,000,000 beri

314
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,520
OF COURSE YOU ARE!!

315
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,960
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MONEY!!?

316
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,820
USOPP FELL OFF!

317
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,120
NAMI! Quit being so damn misleading!

318
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,070
Huh? What's your problem?

319
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,620
There's no point worrying about Vivi!

320
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,370
Oi! Usopp has FALLEN OFF!

321
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,790
That's his problem!

322
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,460
IT'S YOUR FAULT!

323
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,270
Carue!

324
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,810
Is Carue here!?

325
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,870
It won't work, Igaram.

326
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,970
Why?

327
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,460
They should at least know where they now stand in society!

328
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,280
I sent them on the Super Spot-billed Duck Squad.

329
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,010
Even Carue wouldn't be able to catch up now.

330
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,930
And it would only be the same.

331
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,930
What would?

332
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,970
Knowing that would just make them happier.

333
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,210
Nothing would change.

334
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,260
But-

335
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,990
You don't have to worry about them!

336
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,640
Now get out!

337
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm going to sleep.

338
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,090
Early start tomorrow, right?

339
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh yes, indeed!

340
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,780
Tomorrow you must deliver a speech to the country.

341
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,170
I know.

342
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,600
Come on, Carue. Let's sleep together.

343
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,850
Igaram-san...

344
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,240
Something is not right...

345
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,210
What do you mean?

346
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,790
She was too blithe about it...

347
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,640
Something is wrong...

348
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,400
Something is very wrong...

349
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,850
It's so quiet... Carue.

350
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,780
It's been so long since we've had a night this quiet.

351
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,260
No more refrigerator burglar and the fighting cook...

352
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,650
Or the swordsman doing his night training...

353
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,710
Or the half-awake, pillow-throwing navigator...

354
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,800
They're all gone.

355
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,000
A Den Den Mushi? From who?

356
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,930
From someone named "Bon-chan".

357
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,380
Bon-chan? Who's that?

358
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,970
We don't know him.

359
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,990
But he claims to be your friend, so...

360
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,180
Friend?

361
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,680
Hello, hello?

362
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,370
Hel-lo~!?

363
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,370
It's ME!

364
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,970
It. Is. ME!

365
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,120
WHAT IS IT!?

366
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Oh, it's you.

367
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,040
What do you want with us?

368
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,890
Oh!?

369
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,430
Isn't that the voice of Straw-chan!?

370
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,630
You're so strooong~! I was so surprised~!

371
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh, yes, yes! Don't go calling me Mr. 2!

372
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,810
If the Marines get wind of this conversation, I'll be in super big trouble!

373
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,640
He just said it himself!

374
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,980
Just spit it out.

375
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,290
Ah, right, right, right.

376
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,650
I took your little ship!

377
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,870
WHAT THE HELL!?

378
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,610
Asshole! That ain't funny! Where are you now!?

379
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,670
I'm on your boooaaat~!

380
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,080
Of all the annoying bastards in the world...

381
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,710
You've got it wrooong, all wrooong~!

382
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,910
Aren't you and I friends~?

383
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,310
He's upstream on the Sandora River.

384
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,220
Can we trust him?

385
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,610
We were friends with him before...

386
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,910
The idea of you becoming friends again scares me.

387
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,810
But... we don't really have a choice.

388
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,860
That's right. He's got our ship.

389
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,330
If he's trying anything funny, we'll just kick his ass.

390
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,110
Then let's get moving already.

391
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,690
Yosh, let's get going.

392
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,110
If the ship is taken, we gotta...

393
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,520
Hey, everyone...

394
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,370
Hey... everyone...

395
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,690
What should I do?

396
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,900
Listen carefully, Vivi.

397
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,220
We'll give you twelve hours to think.

398
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:23,560
Sandora River

399
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:23,560
Nanohana

400
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:23,560
Current Location


401
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,560
Eastern Harbor

402
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,350
After we take back our ship on the Sandora River,

403
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,260
Then exactly at noon tomorrow,

404
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,080
We'll swing the ship past the eastern harbor once.

405
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,210
I doubt we'll be able to drop anchor,

406
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,220
So if you want to keep adventuring with us,

407
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,700
That will be the last chance you'll have to jump on board.

408
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,550
If so, we'll celebrate! As pirates!

409
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,780
You're the Princess of the Kingdom, so this is the best invitation we can give you.

410
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,990
Come, Vivi!

411
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,360
You have to come! Come right now!

412
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,450
Stop it, Luffy!

413
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,400
Let's go!

414
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,330
What?

415
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,830
Don't you guys want her to come!?

416
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,110
It's not that!

417
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,950
Vivi has to decide this on her own!

418
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,280
Tomorrow at 12 noon...

419
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
The eastern harbor...

420
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,940
Carue can make it in four hours,

421
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,540
So I'll have to leave here at 8 o'clock to make it in time.

422
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,250
I've never considered becoming a pirate myself...

423
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,680
The chance to choose between two different lives...

424
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,920
...is something that will never be offered to me again.

425
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,490
I've never thought being a princess was boring.

426
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,400
And even with the rebellion over...

427
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,430
...the country is still in a terrible state.

428
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,880
If I went...

429
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,110
You'd come too, right?

430
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,250
Right, Carue?

431
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,040
What do... you want to do?

432
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,820
I WAS WAAAITING FOR YOU GUYS~!

433
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,950
HOW LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN~! 

434
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,270
Alright, we made it.

435
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,650
Unload our stuff!

436
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,010
Thanks a lot, guys.

437
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,490
This is farewell to you all as well!

438
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,740
Take care going home!

439
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,110
Send our regards to the King and the Chikuwa Ossan!

440
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,750
Stay well!

441
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,790
Some day...

442
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,380
Some day, let us meet again!

443
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,900
WHAT A BIG MINUTE!

444
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,720
What is it now?

445
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,390
What do you mean, "What is it now"!?

446
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,200
What kind of attitude is that towards your friend!?

447
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,590
What do you mean "friend"?

448
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,830
You're our enemy!

449
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,020
You tricked us.

450
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,630
I did NOT trick you!

451
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,770
I didn't know either!

452
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,480
But, really... That's all in the past now...

453
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
Baroque Works has crumbled.

454
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,950
We're not enemies anymore.

455
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,930
Shift over.

456
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,670
Oh, sorry.

457
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,840
If you're not our enemy, why the hell are you on our ship!?

458
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,700
You silly, silly man!

459
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,690
WHAT WAS THAT!?

460
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,950
Look!

461
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,670
If I wasn't on this ship right now,

462
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,290
What do you think would have happened to it!?

463
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,310
The Marine might have taken it.

464
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,480
Not "MIGHT" have!

465
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,800
It would have definitely been taken!

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,970
Do you knooow what's happening to this island right now!?

467
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,050
It's entirely blockaded by Marine ships!

468
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,830
Blockaded!

469
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,750
So then...

470
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,070
You protected the Going Merry from the Marines!?

471
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,590
Why!?

472
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,560
What for!?

473
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,130
Because we're friends!

474
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,960
Is there any more to bring on?

475
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,630
Nope! This is the last of it.

476
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,330
So then, Mr. 2...

477
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,640
With the Marine blockading the entire island, that would mean you couldn't escape either.

478
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,970
And so you're using us to escape safely?

479
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,320
BON-CHAN!

480
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,400
Yes!

481
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,910
Because we need each other!

482
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,890
IN THE NAME OF SACRED FRIENDSHIP,

483
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,790
LET US COMBINE OUR FORCES AND FIGHT TOGRTHER AS ONE!

484
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,700
Thanks for helping us out!

485
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,140
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THERE!?

486
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
Hina-jou!

487
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,850
Hina-jou!

488
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,250
We've sighted them! It's the Straw Hat Pirates' vessel!

489
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,190
They are upstream on the Sandora River!

490
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,310
Prepare for battle.

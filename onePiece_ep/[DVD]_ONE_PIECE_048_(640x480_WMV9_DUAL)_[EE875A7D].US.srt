1
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,404
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,446
Whoo-hoo!

3
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,657
What a huge town!

4
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,495
Lots of pirates stock up at this town before
heading out to the Grand Line.

5
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,956
You can get pretty much whatever you want here!

6
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,292
Alright! For my upcoming great adventure,

7
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm gonna need to get some cool stuff.

8
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,339
I'll bet there's lots of good food to check out here.

9
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,258
And lots of good women!

10
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,260
There's something I wanna buy too.

11
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,220
Oh? And how would you do that?

12
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,597
You're totally broke, aren't you?

13
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,726
Okay! I'm gonna check out the execution platform!

14
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,272
I want to see it! The place where
the Pirate King died!!

15
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,734
Hey, hey! We haven't decided on
a place to meet back up yet!

16
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,319
Man... he's hopeless.

17
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,743
The Pirate King was born here, and he died here tool

18
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,411
He probably even walked down this very street!

19
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:41,911
He probably even walked down this very street!

20
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,662
He probably even walked down this very street!

21
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,079
He probably even walked down this very street!

22
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,748
YAHOO!

23
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:53,381
THE TOWN OF BEGINNING AND THE END
ARRIVAL AT LOGUETOWN

24
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:53,506
THE TOWN OF BEGINNING AND THE END
ARRIVAL AT LOGUETOWN

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,800
How's this?

26
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,261
Oh! It looks wonderful on you miss!

27
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,179
This?

28
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,473
OH! Elegant, miss!

29
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:01,973
This?

30
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,475
Elemental, miss!

31
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,643
And this?

32
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,728
An elegy!

33
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,189
Will you be purchasing all of them today?

34
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,024
Nope, none of them.

35
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,942
I'm looking for something more casual.

36
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,570
Please come again soon!

37
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,780
Oh...! A tasty aperitif...

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,448
Oh...! A tasty aperitif...

39
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,118
OH!! A lovely two-item dish!

40
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:22,952
This town is just full of delicious foods to sample!

41
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:26,164
This town is just full of delicious foods to sample!

42
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,876
Andyou don't even know which
to try first, you sily dog, you!

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,589
l think I just found the MAIN DISH!

44
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,384
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

45
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,719
Too cool! This is crazy!

46
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,180
This place is full of cool stuff!

47
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,682
Welcome, sir!

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,518
All of the items you see on display...

49
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,521
...were used by pirates who sailed the Grand Line!

50
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,440
These are valuable, special items, of course.

51
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,903
You mean... these are all things they used
in their adventures on the Grand Line?

52
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,197
You mean... these are all things they used
in their adventures on the Grand Line?

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,118
We aim to cater to the needs
of true warriors of the sea.

54
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,454
We are so glad to have your business!

55
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:06,913
We are so glad to have your business!

56
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,623
So how about it?

57
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:12,210
This is a gun that was actually used by Gold Roger!

58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,879
WHAT!? It was Gold Roger's?

59
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:15,922
Yes!

60
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,631
Whoa-ho-ho!

61
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:16,965
Whoa-ho-ho!

62
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,215
Sir! What do you think?

63
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:17,632
Sir! What do you think?

64
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,259
Sir! What do you think?

65
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,094
Show me more stuff, please!

66
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,637
With pleasure!

67
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,985
Captain Smoker! There's an alert!

68
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,905
We've received notification from
Marine Headquarters...

69
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:45,994
That Monkey D. Luffy and his band of
pirates are headed towards Loguetown!

70
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,914
He's the East Blue pirate with a reward
on his head for $30,000,000!

71
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,916
30 million, huh?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,835
Want me to congratulate him or something?

73
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:58,006
He is the one who defeated Don
Krieg and the Merman Arlong!

74
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,007
Shut the hell up!

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,350
Damn your yelling... you broke it.

76
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,601
Forgive me.

77
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,520
Well, forget it. I have my own way of doing things.

78
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,814
I work at my own pace. You know?

79
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,107
I work at my own pace. You know?

80
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,650
Y-Yes sir.

81
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,948
So, you were saying?

82
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,158
Sir

83
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,454
It seems there are a band of pirates
headed for the city today... Sir.

84
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,831
What are you getting all worked up for?

85
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,417
Since I've been at this post,

86
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,004
has there ever been a pirate that's been able
to get out of this city once they've entered?

87
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,089
Well, no...

88
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,216
Then don't get all nervous.

89
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:41,925
I'll take care of it, at my own pace.

90
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,218
I'll take care of it, at my own pace.

91
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:43,718
I'll take care of it, at my own pace.

92
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,552
Yes...

93
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,721
Reporting sir!

94
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,349
Pirates have been sighted at the harbor!

95
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,809
Please come to confirm the situation!

96
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,061
It's got to be the Luffy Pirates, sir!

97
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,230
There weren't any others mentioned in the bulletin!

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,940
30 million, huh?

99
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,359
That's something I'd like to see.

100
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,068
Huh?

101
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,070
Just thinking out loud. Forget it.

102
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,491
Don't you need this?

103
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,373
Captain, please request backup.

104
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,624
Don't need it.

105
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,711
But! The supposed strength of the enemy...

106
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,296
Shut the hell up.

107
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,550
Don't tell me how to do things!

108
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,719
I'm very sorry sir!

109
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm very sorry sir!

110
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,846
Whatever, where's Tashigi?

111
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,182
Oh... actually, she's been out since this morning.

112
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,102
She missed the morning drills.

113
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,938
That ditzy girl... Where'd she go off to now?

114
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,148
Yay! Three scoop ice cream!

115
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:38,398
Yay! Three scoop ice cream!

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:38,732
Yay! Three scoop ice cream!

117
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,107
Yay! Three scoop ice cream!

118
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,568
Hey, hey! Careful you don't fall when you run!

119
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:41,693
Hey, hey! Careful you don't fall when you run!

120
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,786
C-captain Smoker!

121
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,955
My ice cream...

122
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,374
I'm so sorry! My kid...

123
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:56,833
I'm so sorry! My kid...

124
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,961
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry!! SORRY!!

125
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,380
Sorry, kid.

126
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,464
Sorry, kid.

127
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,342
Looks like my pants ate your ice cream.

128
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,802
Here, go buy yourself five scoops.

129
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,346
Let's go.

130
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:09,804
Aye.

131
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:12,515
Th-thank you so much!

132
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:12,766
Th-thank you so much!

133
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,016
Th-thank you so much!

134
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:13,266
Th-thank you so much!

135
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:13,641
Th-thank you so much!

136
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,143
Thank you.

137
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:15,560
Thank you.

138
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,194
Clean the place out, m'hearties! Leave
not a bloomin' penny thar!

139
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,155
For ye see, that these provisions be necessities,

140
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,033
for Gary-sama of the Crescent Moon
to become the Pirate King!

141
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,869
So make sure ye get it all!

142
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:33,912
Oi...

143
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:34,662
Huh?

144
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,414
Which one's the boss?

145
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,458
Who the hell are you?

146
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,544
You the bastard known as Monkey D. Luffy?

147
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,256
Let's see how tough you are,
since you're stupid enough...

148
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,384
...to show that ugly face in my town.

149
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:47,467
...to show that ugly face in my town.

150
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:47,884
What? You've gotta be kidding me!

151
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,718
What? You've gotta be kidding me!

152
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,719
What? You've gotta be kidding me!

153
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:50,929
Get him, lads!

154
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,107
Captain Smoker?

155
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,860
Yeah! You know, he's one of the top
soldiers from Marine Headquarters.

156
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,323
This town used to be full of pirates
heading for the Grand Line.

157
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,372
But since the Captain was stationed here,

158
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:17,914
every pirate who comes into the
city ends up in the slammer.

159
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,292
He's not normal. They say he's a monster.

160
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,462
They even say he has the power
of the Devil's Fruit, you know.

161
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,257
The Devil's Fruit?

162
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,557
A job well done, Captain!

163
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,642
You finished off the Luffy Pirates in record time!

164
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,644
Are you blind, or just stupid?

165
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,688
How could these losers be Luffy's?

166
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,192
If these pansies are worth 30 million,
then it's the end of the world.

167
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,069
T-Then what about Luffy?

168
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,779
He'll show himself soon enough.

169
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,240
And then the fun will start.

170
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,742
Huh?

171
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,413
How did I end up back at the harbor? How?

172
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,874
HEY!

173
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,168
Is that another one of those idiots?

174
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,462
I don't think so...

175
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,466
What luck! Can you tell me how to
get to the execution platform?

176
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,717
The execution platform?

177
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,635
Yeah, I think I'm lost...

178
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,554
I've never seen your face around before.

179
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,432
Yeah! I just came here today.

180
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,601
Man what a big city!

181
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,686
It's totally different from Fuusha Village.

182
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,730
Why are you looking for the gallows?

183
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,065
I want to see it.

184
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,067
The place where the Pirate King died!

185
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,364
You don't know?

186
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:33,448
Whatever.

187
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:34,366
Wait.

188
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,992
Look where the smoke points.

189
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,496
Ooh! Over there?

190
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,663
Thanks!

191
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,214
Shit! So much!

192
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,216
They're too damn expensive!

193
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,967
You need a loan?

194
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,393
That's fine!

195
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:58,390
But you'll need to pay me back 3
times over with interest, okay?

196
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,309
I can't borrow any more money from that woman.

197
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,560
But one sword isn't enough for Grand Line.

198
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,938
- So, you ain't with that monster today?
But one sword isn't enough for Grand Line.

199
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:05,438
- So, you ain't with that monster today?
What do I do?

200
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:05,689
What do I do?

201
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,065
Excuse me, you're being rude!

202
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:07,240
Excuse me, you're being rude!

203
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,649
Huh?

204
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,693
Shut up!

205
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,947
Thanks to him, our boss is locked up in jail!

206
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,198
Have you not given up?

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,491
No way!

208
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,952
You chicken or something?

209
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,997
We're going to send you back to him in pieces!

210
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,249
I understand.

211
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,709
I will have to fight with you.

212
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,503
'That so, baby?

213
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,130
Don't make me laugh!

214
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,424
What the hell can a little woman like you do?

215
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,051
Take this!

216
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,529
Whoa, she won!

217
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,489
That was so cool, lady!

218
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:02,787
Guess she can't handle her own strength!

219
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,247
My glasses...
Guess she can't handle her own strength!

220
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:04,497
Guess she can't handle her own strength!

221
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:04,998
Glasses...

222
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,166
Glasses...

223
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,042
Glasses...

224
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,209
Glasses...

225
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,627
Hey. Looking for these?

226
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,798
I-I'm sorry!

227
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,510
Thank you so much.

228
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:21,931
My glasses!

229
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,599
I-I-It was an accident...!
My glasses!

230
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,933
I-I-It was an accident...!

231
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,143
Those are expensive, you know!

232
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,936
Why would you do such a cruel thing?

233
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,437
But I didn't mean to...!

234
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,521
But I didn't mean to...!

235
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,315
Please replace them!

236
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:30,482
Please replace them!

237
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:37,197
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

238
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,329
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

239
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,053
Man, I'm beat...

240
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,180
I was trying to get to the execution platform,

241
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,766
but this doesn't look like the right way at all.

242
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,560
Oh well, I'm bound to run into it eventually.

243
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,607
Lets see, which way...

244
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,070
Gold Roger?

245
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,259
Old man, are you the owner?

246
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,637
The sign outside says ''Gold Roger''.

247
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,264
Is that the name of this place?

248
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,765
Get out.

249
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,145
This isn't a place for kids.

250
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,106
And we're closed right now.

251
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,025
Out of business?

252
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,862
We're not out of business! It's just after hours!

253
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,447
Now get out!

254
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,324
I was just curious about the name...

255
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,493
I'm lost.

256
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,538
I wanted to go see the execution platform.

257
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,623
Can you tell me how to get there?

258
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,710
What's that thing on the table?

259
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,756
It's a skull! It's huge!

260
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:23,303
This is the skull of a man known as the ''Killer Giant.''

261
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,556
A man who killed hundreds of pirates.

262
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,766
He was a devil.

263
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,105
But Gold Roger fought and killed him.

264
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,607
Gold Roger did?

265
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,484
It's a famous tale!

266
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,738
He was a big, rough guy, with a big sword!

267
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,449
The battle was decided pretty quickly.

268
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,118
This gash is what killed him.

269
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,289
But he was really something.

270
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,625
His last words were..

271
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,003
''Roger. No one can touch you.''

272
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,881
''I praise you as the eternal pirate.''

273
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,093
Awesome! Cool!

274
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,720
King, of the Eric Pirates...

275
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:10,892
The famous gunner Silver-Silver...

276
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,105
All were very dangerous men.

277
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,817
Yet before Roger, they were like scared little babies.

278
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,738
Wanna hear more?

279
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,572
Yeah!

280
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,828
Nowadays youngsters don't usually
take an interest in this stuff.

281
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,705
I don't care, just tell me more!

282
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,039
Pesky kid!

283
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,583
Gold Roger...

284
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,793
Back then...

285
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,336
No, still today...

286
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,340
He's the only pirate who truly didn't
fear the dangers of the Grand Line.

287
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,470
Because you see, the area known as the Grand Line,

288
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,683
is a place where ships disappear
and are never seen again.

289
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,852
Navigation is said to be impossible.

290
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,895
Because people are so scared of it,

291
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,941
they seldom come close to that cursed ocean.

292
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,695
Old man. I want some more rum.

293
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,946
The whole bottle.

294
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,159
You seem to be enjoying yourself, Roger.

295
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,707
Yeah, that's for sure.

296
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,336
Because after this, I'm taking off for
a little stroll through the Grand Line.

297
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,464
I'm so excited. I can't help myself.

298
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,925
Hey! Are you really headed for that cursed ocean?

299
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,219
Why not? You saying I can't?

300
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,597
Well, not really, just...

301
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,059
I won't stop you, but please, don't go there.

302
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,061
They say it's a place no one ever returns from!

303
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,689
That's exactly why I want to go.

304
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,693
So, some more rum please, another
bottle would be good.

305
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,614
Saying that, he cleared out all the booze in the bar...

306
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,868
and set off the next morning, as though
there was nothing to fear.

307
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,832
Later on, when I heard he had
conquered the Grand Line,

308
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:02,629
I was so surprised, I even forgot my age for a bit!

309
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,840
But now, everyone has passed on.

310
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:10,136
Roger was executed at the gallows
here in town twenty years ago.

311
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,682
And from that day, everyone's been going around

312
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,184
with the audacity to call themselves pirates.

313
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,978
They even call this ''The Great Pirate Age.''

314
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,775
But it's all just a bunch of rubbish...

315
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,694
Cowards.

316
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:30,907
Less and less people are daring
to sail the Grand Line.

317
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:35,245
And so, that is the reason this
place will be closed down.

318
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,580
I'm... going to the Grand Line.

319
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,331
Huh?

320
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,251
He was cool, huh? Gold Roger.

321
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,586
Pirates should try to be like him.

322
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,505
That's why I went out to sea...

323
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,925
...to go to the Grand Line and find One Piece.

324
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,094
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

325
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,646
That's a crazy thing to say!

326
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,315
How could you say that, here in this place?

327
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,651
What? But I'm just telling the truth.

328
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,783
Kid, after having a customer like you,

329
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,702
Don't do that for me.

330
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,580
It's decided. There's nothing you
can do to change my mind.

331
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,875
It's been a long time since I had a customer.

332
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,918
Drink's on the house.

333
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,296
I don't drink.

334
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,758
Is that so? Then how about this?

335
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,472
Kanpai to him, to the Eternal Pirate King.

336
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,061
To the Eternal Pirate King!

337
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,530
So it's you, huh?

338
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,282
The usual greeting, eh?

339
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,327
Not a nice way to treat an old customer.

340
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,537
You ruined my business.

341
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,331
I don't feel like joking around with you.

342
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,751
You shouldn't think of me as
someone who betrayed you.

343
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,295
It's not my fault this is the business you're in.

344
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:11,299
The pirates today are all weaklings.
That's the real problem.

345
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,554
A customer, huh? That's pretty unusual.

346
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,517
I'd like some rum.

347
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,144
We don't serve your kind here.

348
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,313
That's discrimination, you know.

349
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:28,441
Today is a special day.

350
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,402
Isn't it?

351
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,950
That's the stuff.

352
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,539
What happened on that day, even
now, is so clear in my mind.

353
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,251
Roger, in his last moments.

354
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,797
This is Main Street.

355
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,342
Wonder if Gold Roger walked along this street...

356
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,552
That's right.

357
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,097
It was a hot, muggy day just like today.

358
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,853
On his way to the execution platform,

359
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,105
even though his hands were bound,

360
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,442
he carried himself with pride.

361
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,140
Wealth, Fame, Power.

362
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,478
The Man who had Everything
in this World... Gold Roger.

363
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,230
Walking towards his death...

364
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,192
He held himself high, like a proud warrior.

365
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,487
Inherited Will,

366
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,280
The Destiny of the Age,

367
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,074
The Dreams of its People.

368
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,827
As long as people continue to pursue
the meaning of Freedom,

369
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:05,789
These things will never cease!

370
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,633
Have you any last words?

371
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,470
Can you take this off?

372
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,764
It's, chafing me.

373
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,099
I cannot do that!

374
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,267
Why would I run away now?

375
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,813
Hmm. That's a little saddening..

376
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,820
Well, go ahead and finish it.

377
00:20:53,463 --> 00:20:55,505
HEY! PIRATE KING!

378
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,675
What did you do with your treasure?

379
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,219
It's somewhere on the Grand Line, isn't it?

380
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,096
You have it, don't you?

381
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:05,325
The greatest treasure in the world!?

382
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,725
Please, Keep your mouth!
The greatest treasure in the world!?

383
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,477
Your one special treasure?

384
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,107
ONE PIECE!

385
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,493
My treasure?

386
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,870
All right! That's enough!

387
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,580
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

388
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,197
Go look for it.

389
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:32,375
I left all of it at that place!

390
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,251
EXECUTE!!
I left all of it at that place!

391
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:33,960
EXECUTE!!

392
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,039
That was the beginning of everything.

393
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,334
Hey!

394
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,628
This is the new wanted listing.

395
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,962
Post this somewhere visible.

396
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:21,549
C-Captain Smoker, sir! Excuse me!

397
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,092
Huh?

398
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:27,389
Uhh...

399
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,557
That Straw Hat...

400
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,185
He's Monkey D. Luffy!

401
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,317
There it is...

402
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:43,738
This is the place where the Pirate King was executed.

403
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:43,988
This is the place where the Pirate King was executed.

404
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:51,413
The place where the greatest
pirate who ever lived... died.

405
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,749
The place of the beginning.

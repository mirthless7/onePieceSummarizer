1
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:55,130
The opinion of storm of Nami!

2
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:55,130
The explosion of the Climate Tact

3
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,710
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,220
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,270
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,260
In order to save Arabasta, the companions continue the combat.

7
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,890
Sanji was almost overcome whereas it fought against the Kenpo Ballet of Mr. 2 Good Clay.

8
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,190
But during their duel, Sanji discovered the weak point of the capacity Mane Basket

9
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,690
and finally the victory gained.

10
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,460
During this time, princess Vivi ordered the destruction of the palate,

11
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,040
in an attempt despaired to save its people.

12
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,280
But, a few seconds before the detonation,

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,810
Crocodile appeared in front of them.

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,750
Did Luffy-San die?

15
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,980
I cannot believe it!

16
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,200
Believe it.

17
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,150
Straw hat is buried under sand with Rainbase.

18
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,990
Wednesday miss.

19
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,430
If it had not been implied in your stories,

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,410
he would have lived longer.

21
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,810
Somebody as you could never kill Luffy-San!

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,070
Eh well, you are enough brave to shout me above, because these pirates are ready to give their lives for you.

23
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,440
I hope that you thanked them.

24
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,350
Then perhaps that those which died will be able…

25
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,960
Where is Luffy-San?

26
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,480
Why are you there?

27
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,690
… to rest in peace.

28
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,450
I can hear grondement battle up to now.

29
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,910
They did not can retain the rebellious army at the entry.

30
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,840
Vivi and the others are well?

31
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,960
You all…

32
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,260
They risk their lives in this battle.

33
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,940
But me…

34
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,540
Therefore, you see…

35
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,700
I need a more powerful weapon!

36
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,820
A more powerful weapon?

37
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,460
And why you want to become stronger?

38
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,600
Ben…

39
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,700
I am not one fighting…

40
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,950
I have a look of hell and I am nice, but…

41
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,240
But about what do you speak?

42
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,220
But I…

43
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,520
One needs that I would be sufficiently strong, not to be a ball…

44
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,990
Especially now, for Vivi.

45
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,550
Usopp…

46
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,760
You include/understand, hein?

47
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,870
We are not like them.

48
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,240
Their force does not have anything human.
They are almost monsters.

49
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,120
They are enough strong to overcome no matter whom only with their rough force.

50
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,410
But… us two, we do not have their power. We are normal.

51
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,820
Once the started combat, we will be too afraid to do anything.

52
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,060
And then one will be in their legs since one cannot protect oneself all alone.

53
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,370
Therefore, so of people as we want to fight,

54
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,000
we need arm powerful!

55
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,170
Do not be to you agreement?

56
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,240
The reason why you évertues to manufacture new weapons,

57
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,500
it is because you want to prove that you are able to beat you like the others, not?

58
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,980
Then me too!

59
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,530
For Vivi,

60
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,170
I want to be able to only beat me!

61
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,240
Give me this capacity!

62
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,280
It does not remain enough any more of time before we do not arrive at Arabasta.

63
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,700
It is true…

64
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,960
I suppose that I cannot so easily become stronger after all.

65
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,110
Afflicted to have asked you the impossible one.

66
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,840
Who said that the lack of time made the thing impossible?

67
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,220
Hey!

68
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,330
Be to you saying that there exists a thing that Large Usopp-Sama is unable to make?

69
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,420
Then…

70
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,310
You will do it?

71
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,080
I love you!

72
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,950
Thank you very much, Usopp!

73
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,240
Well, now it is necessary that one discusses the cost of materials…

74
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,290
Thank you infinitely! Really!

75
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,210
Hey, hey, hey.

76
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,330
It is a weapon which you requests.

77
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,890
Ca costs money fabriq…

78
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,240
Good, good luck!

79
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,390
Hey, you me listenings?

80
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,690
You two, you are free!

81
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,310
Nami-San…?

82
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,440
What do I card-index?

83
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,150
This noise almost made me die fear.

84
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,590
I played the courageous one in front of Usopp.

85
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,750
I am supposed to be ready!

86
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,800
For Vivi, I will fight!

87
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,390
It is true. Usopp held word.

88
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,870
In this case, I can do it!

89
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,700
I can fight against a femm…

90
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,250
You cannot escape to me, pullet.

91
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,510
Miss Doubles Finger…

92
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,330
She used a lance or what?

93
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,360
Or perhaps that it has a capacity, it also…

94
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,110
You ace already measuring rod?

95
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,730
Thanks to the fruit Toga Toga,
I became a woman-spine.

96
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,730
Toga = Spine

97
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,680
I can create spines with any part of my body.

98
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,840
Spines which manage to cross a stone wall like a motte de beurre…

99
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,650
If I am once made have,

100
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,410
it will transpierce me the body and it will be finished by it of me.

101
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,680
Not? You all the same will not fight against me, I hope!

102
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,040
And if!

103
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,310
It calls the clouds!

104
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,470
It makes fall the rain!

105
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,840
It even makes blow the wind!

106
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,180
Combined good way, these miraculous “Tacts” cause natural catastrophes!

107
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,570
You will inaugurate my new weapon!

108
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,250
The Climate Tact!

109
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,320
What it…

110
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,870
Initially, a released time!

111
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,100
Ahh, it is nice!

112
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
Doves which fly away!

113
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,600
It IS WHAT THIS SHIT?

114
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,990
You are… well?

115
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,320
It is in this way that an attack is begun!

116
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,950
It is necessary that the enemy lowers his guard.

117
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,410
I included/understood, Usopp!

118
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,970
It is the end, now!

119
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,630
Oh, what a pretty flowers!

120
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,990
I CANNOT FIGHT WITH CA!

121
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,530
It IS WHAT CA?

122
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,610
SAY SOMETHING, BROTHEL!

123
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,410
I do not know what it crosses, but…

124
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,170
I have sorrow for it.

125
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,450
Quickly! Vivi-Sama is in danger!

126
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Guns! Bring the guns!

127
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,660
We must pass this door, quickly!

128
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,820
What…

129
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,160
I hope that will help us to have a little calm here.

130
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,220
You are obstinate, hein?

131
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,250
It is useless to continue to flee.

132
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,510
I am well afraid which you have no chance to gain.

133
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,360
Ca, it is which you believe!

134
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,550
According to the directions for use, there remains still a heap of attacks to be tested!

135
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,690
My Climate Tact!

136
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,880
You!

137
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,990
When did you take?

138
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,470
Oh, please…

139
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,800
You made it fall.

140
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,600
Return the-me!

141
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,520
Eh well, take it again.

142
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,790
I am not magician, me.

143
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,320
And then, I do not need that to beat me.

144
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,890
Would be a nice little girl and does not move.

145
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,440
Accept your defeat, and I promise a death without pain to you.

146
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,700
Or… will you continue your amusing small spectacle of magic?

147
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,910
Attention with the lightning!

148
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,490
My cheek… I bleed!

149
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,870
I wonder whether I will die…

150
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,220
I probably will die…

151
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,600
I will die…

152
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,070
If ever I die,

153
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,280
I will return to haunt

154
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,190
this naze with the large nose!

155
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,290
Naze with the large nose!

156
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,350
It could not better do…

157
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,840
Hein?

158
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,150
Well, now you will die.

159
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,330
Ready?

160
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,390
It is held under the bridge…

161
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,770
But how?

162
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,300
It was right!

163
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,580
With… wait one second!!

164
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,650
Stop!

165
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,190
I said to you to wait!

166
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,890
Wait!

167
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,620
One minute!

168
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,910
Only a minute!

169
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,380
If I remain in outside, it will have me!

170
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,540
It is finished!

171
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,030
You will finish out of ratatouille!

172
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,910
Ben…

173
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,820
I do not prefer!

174
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,510
I believed that it was its first combat.

175
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,460
It would be said that I was mistaken.

176
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,590
It was what?

177
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,560
I am sure to have read something of interesting in the directions for use of the Climate Tact presently…

178
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,080
It was where?

179
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,710
Eh yes! All the techniques described here are brilliant to put environment in your festivals,

180
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,130
guaranteed recreation!

181
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,080
WHAT A STUNNED!

182
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,060
Now, look with the back for the techniques of combat.

183
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,540
With the back?

184
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,860
Good, where you hide you now,

185
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,250
my kitten?

186
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,970
Finished playing hide-and-seek!

187
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,580
I was a robber during eight years.

188
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,580
And in each situation of life or death,

189
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,750
I left myself there only!

190
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,360
To be compared with the first come girl,

191
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,750
is an insult!

192
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,490
Good Ah?

193
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,410
You see me sorry.

194
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,370
What did it arrive to you? It would be said that you found confidence in you.

195
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,110
I warn you! Now, I am ready to beat me!

196
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,280
Techniques of combat.

197
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,670
To know the properties of three Tacts.

198
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,710
To blow in each Tact,

199
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,540
will produce various types of bubbles.

200
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,760
One produced of the hot air.

201
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,260
Heat Ball!

202
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,050
What? The weather is hotter.

203
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,960
Another product of the cold air.

204
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,600
Cool Ball!

205
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
Oh, it makes frisquet.

206
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,210
And the last product of the electrified air.

207
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,900
Thunder Ball!

208
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,300
Oh, that tickles.

209
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,330
These techniques must of course be sophisticated,

210
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,320
therefore, if you use them during the festivals…

211
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,930
Then do not write them!!

212
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,730
Is Ca there, you are content?

213
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,480
Go! A useful trick!

214
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,460
More turn of magic, but a true technique!

215
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,300
Afflicted.

216
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,730
I do not have any more time to play.

217
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,710
I included/understood!

218
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,540
The bubble of heat and the bubble of cold!

219
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,080
When they stop turning, the bubbles enter in collision and create a draft

220
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,870
creating an explosive strong gale!

221
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,640
It is brilliant, Usopp!

222
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,790
The Tenpo Cyclone is like a boomerang.

223
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,560
After the festival, you can go outside and with your friends!

224
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,230
I was not even with the current for that!

225
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,150
But…

226
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,840
Perhaps that now…

227
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,590
Which strange weapon…

228
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,560
Never lose sight of the fact your adversary before the end of the combat!

229
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,420
You turn the back on your adversary during the combat?

230
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,350
Did you forget that I try to kill you?

231
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,780
I used the Cool Ball to increase the density of the air.

232
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,590
The extreme difference in temperature in the air causes a refraction of the light.

233
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,130
A mirage!

234
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,400
Of also near, it is impossible!

235
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,360
Our force anything, is not compared with their.

236
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,180
This is why one must use our head to survive!

237
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,240
It is as that which one fights, you and me, not?

238
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,530
Used correctly, I can cause miracles!

239
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,340
It is the perfect weapon for me!

240
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,010
I finally included/understood the Climate Tact!

241
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,060
Go!

242
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
Father!

243
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,630
Slacken the King, Crocodile!

244
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,760
Hold, hold.

245
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,510
You really believe that I would have décarcassé myself to immobilize it

246
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,130
to let it leave just because you ask it to me?

247
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,690
Do Eh bah, reflect a little, you want?

248
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,270
Forgive me, Vivi.

249
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:13,850
I wasted the opportunity for which you risked your life…

250
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,190
Father…

251
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,590
Is Ah, to it the type of things that a father called to his daughter when they are found finally?

252
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,400
But now, Wednesday Miss…

253
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,240
CALL Me NEVER AGAIN LIKE CA!

254
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,070
Firstly, I at all do not intend to let to you live both.

255
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,480
It is normal that the royal family falls with her kingdom.

256
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,400
Aren't you agreement?

257
00:20:52,310 --> 00:21:00,130
But before I take the throne, I have a question for you, Mister the ex-king.

258
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,890
Since the beginning, that was my final objective.

259
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,170
Cobra.

260
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,010
Where is Pluton?

261
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,580
You…

262
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
How do you know this name?

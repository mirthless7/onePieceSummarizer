1
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:41,160
A battle of very hot kitchen?

2
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:41,160
Sanji against a tempting chief-cook

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,290
I sought you Sanji…

4
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,220
since ten years!

5
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,430
It is called Carmen!

6
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,760
The best chief cook of any East Blue!

7
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,290
The Impassioned Woman, thus one me
call to me blazing Carmen.

8
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,440
I am its first disciple, Leon!

9
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,190
And me the second, Jose!

10
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,230
Oh! What a creature!

11
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,060
For a chief as splendid as you, to seek me had to be…

12
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,470
Ah, I am with the paradise!

13
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,430
I am honoured to make your knowledge, Carmen-san!

14
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,560
How oses you?

15
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,420
What a overflowing passion!

16
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,570
But, Carmen-San…

17
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,130
One already met some share?

18
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,860
Jose! Leon!

19
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,430
Explain to him.

20
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,270
Yes.

21
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,030
Look at.

22
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,780
It is what?

23
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,620
They all are of the chief cooks.

24
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,800
Yes!

25
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,730
They are of course the most famous chiefs of East Blue.

26
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,260
But each one its turn, they faced
Carmen-sama and lost all in beauty!

27
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,320
Yes, I am the “number one” of all
chiefs of East Blue.

28
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,750
Among all the chiefs who dared to defy me,
none arrived to me at ankle.

29
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,770
I started to believe that I did not have the equal one in East Blue…

30
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,550
But while you still worked
in Baratie, an article was published.

31
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,630
I could read above that their younger chief
was the best cook of any East Blue!

32
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,850
To lose such a title vis-a-vis an unknown?
It was ridiculous!

33
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,630
Since, I put myself to seek you.

34
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,000
I excavated all the corners of East Blue
during the 10 last years!

35
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,190
In fact, that done only 10 days.

36
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,820
Carmen-sama likes sometimes exagérerla situation.

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,770
Your mouths, both!

38
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,700
Face me, Sanji!

39
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,350
Come to the contest from kitchen
this afternoon with 13:00!

40
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,310
Over there, I will overcome you no matter what it arrives!
Prepare!

41
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,020
You over there will be awaited!

42
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,850
Ah, Carmen-San.
What a exceptional woman!

43
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,850
Will year-chan, you really take part in it?

44
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,850
Year-chan:man of the west of Japan

45
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,690
Euh? Not, this type of things does not interest me.

46
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,380
This jerk…

47
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,730
I sought it in all the recesses of
this city and always no sign of him…

48
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,690
But Captain?

49
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,560
Why one must get dressed like that?

50
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,150
Don't my word you know only one makes the pirates here?

51
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,400
In this city, bump a dangerous Colonel
name of Smoker.

52
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,730
If it finds us my revenge on Straw hat

53
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,820
and us all will not form any more part of this world!

54
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,380
A thing is sure:

55
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,940
one must find Straw hat as quickly as possible!

56
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,050
Included/understood?

57
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,570
He, I can about it more!

58
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,660
I had never puffed out as much before this meal with Logue Town…

59
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,800
I started to have the flagstone.

60
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,680
In fact me too.

61
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,490
I was hungry but I did not have money on me.

62
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,800
Fortunately that you saw me presently!

63
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,780
I do not have money me either.

64
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,590
What?

65
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,070
You of ace not either?

66
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,680
Why I would have some…

67
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,710
You marks a point!

68
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,300
I have some enough of all this research!

69
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,590
This jerk of Straw hat,

70
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,860
I will kill it out of my own hands if I find it!

71
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,750
And how one will pay our meals?

72
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,060
I will never forgive him…

73
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,320
Perhaps what will they let to us leave?

74
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,600
NEVER!

75
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,490
Oh! Lucky!

76
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,100
You us offers the meal? Sympathetic!

77
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Thank you!

78
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,370
Thank you for the meal!

79
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,800
You give… pleasure.

80
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
So long!

81
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,790
Thank you!

82
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,280
This voice!

83
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,920
Ah, it was the kid with the Straw hat.

84
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,130
It is true, Moji?
Species of imbecile! Will follow it!

85
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,710
Yes!!!!

86
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,380
It left where? It left where?

87
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,680
A market…

88
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,960
Logue Town is really with the height of his reputation!

89
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,960
The quality of the products is exceptional!

90
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,360
It is excellent, that!

91
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,730
Year-chan, you have good eyes.

92
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,760
They were fished this morning close to the coast…

93
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,160
Close to the coast?

94
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,070
Indeed, the fish is fresh,

95
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,140
but I never saw the similar one.

96
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,930
You really fished it in East Blue?

97
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,270
Year-chan, you do not know yourself there badly, one would say…

98
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,340
It is fish species
that one can fish only in West Blue.

99
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,390
The majority of people of East Blue do not even notice it.

100
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,390
West Blue?

101
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,340
Why say that you fished it on the coast then?

102
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,330
Were year-chan, you never in our city before, not?

103
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,320
Because Logue Town is the city nearest to Large Line.

104
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,840
In other words, only fish are not fished
of East Blue but those of the other seas too.

105
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,240
Those of the other seas?

106
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,620
Yes.

107
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,010
They surely arrived here by the force of the currents.

108
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,710
That very often arrives.

109
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,620
It would be said that they caught something.

110
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,330
One will see, Year-chan?

111
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,920
It occurs what?

112
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,400
Ah! It is one…

113
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,560
Brilliant!

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
It is an tuna-elephant with the blue scales?

115
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,240
Exact!

116
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,860
It must surely come from the South Seas and
one took it with a fishing cane!

117
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,280
A fishing cane?

118
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,100
An tuna-elephant?

119
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,590
Come to see! This fish with the odd air!

120
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,910
About what you do speak, Sanji?
A book on edible fish?

121
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,930
You study it?

122
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,540
It is not an tuna-elephant that?

123
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,670
Hein? You know?

124
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,730
It is also called the “Jewel of the Ocean”,
it is an ingredient miracle!

125
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,250
But I never saw some.

126
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,770
Of course that not!

127
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,150
This fish lives only in South Blue.

128
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,180
You will never find any in East Blue.

129
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,650
But if Al Blue existed,
y' would have some over there.

130
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,640
Ouais, but that does not exist.

131
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,090
You ace reason.

132
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,750
It is what Al Blue?

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,590
“Legendary Sea”.

134
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,440
All the fish of the world would swim over there.

135
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,840
Do not say that, it is only one kid!
He really will believe in it.

136
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,730
Where it is?

137
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,090
You see? It did not even understand that it was a joke!

138
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,840
I lied you, Sanji.

139
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,300
There is no chance that it exists.

140
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,640
Forget all that. Continue to work rather.

141
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,990
All Blue…

142
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,760
Well, one will raise it.

143
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,430
Wait a little!

144
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,740
It costs how much?

145
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,190
Sell the-me!

146
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,020
What?

147
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,260
I have money.

148
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,900
Please, sell the-me!

149
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:42,870
Please!

150
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,320
Out of the question. It is not to sell.

151
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,820
I have just decided to make some
a reward. Afflicted.

152
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,950
A reward?

153
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,710
Ouais.

154
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,350
The contest of kitchen of the East
is about to start.

155
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,810
Big bosses of any East Blue
came here to take part in it.

156
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,210
The winner will gain that in reward.

157
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,420
Ouais, it is an tuna-elephant with the blue scales after all.

158
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,030
It will be a first perfect price for the champion.

159
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,630
If you want it at all costs,
why not take part in the contest?

160
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,580
You are a big boss, not?

161
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,250
The inscription is done over there.

162
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,210
If you want, are registered it and made this contest.

163
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,110
If you dispatches not,
the inscriptions will be closed Year-chan.

164
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,280
With more!

165
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,930
A contest of kitchen? Well…

166
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
Euh, wait…

167
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,180
Face me, Sanji!

168
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,950
That does not do anything.

169
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,790
The hour finally had just begun the contest of kitchen!

170
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,260
All the big bosses of East Blue gathered!

171
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,140
What a crowd! What does it occur?

172
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,100
The price of this year:
an tuna-elephant with the blue scales!

173
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,060
This treasure of the ocean, this ingredient miracle…

174
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,460
The only one which will leave with this tuna-elephant
will be gaining it of the contest…

175
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,900
Who will gain this title this year?

176
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,230
Surely me!

177
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,330
I am so happy that you would not have fled, Sanji.

178
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,910
In any case, the title of better chief
of East Blue will be soon mine!

179
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,010
I will implement my exquisite direction of the taste.

180
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,260
Ah, Carmen-San!

181
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,960
I am so happy to re-examine you!

182
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,040
A kiss for our meeting again…

183
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,750
How oses you?

184
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,090
Always this overflowing passion!

185
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,040
He, wait a little!

186
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,320
Look at over there!

187
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,580
Hein? One would say Sanji…

188
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,810
Oh! Oh! 1:00, 2:00, Sanji!

189
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,080
Sanji-Kun!

190
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,580
In Japanese, Sanji means “three hours”

191
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,140
Nami-San!

192
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,350
You came to encourage me?

193
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,080
At all.
One just passed like that.

194
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,740
But why you were registered with this contest?

195
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,330
Oh, Usopp.
Came to you too?

196
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,020
It is me which called you in first!

197
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,710
Lastly, it is time to start!

198
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Here members of the jury!

199
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,210
For an equitable judgment, one requested from Sam-San a person like the others, to belong to the jury!

200
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,250
Are Sam-San, you ready?

201
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,780
Sam-San?

202
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,240
It left!!

203
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,700
The payment is simple.

204
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,700
Each combat will be held with against one!

205
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,520
The best of each duel will be able to advance in the competition. That which will remain at the end of this contest will be declared the best chief of East Blue!

206
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,700
The first match will begin on your left.

207
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,250
Fine bottom of the east, it acts there of
prestigious Shuutai chief Hokage!

208
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,850
And to represent Logue Town, Ekkuri!

209
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,200
Loans?

210
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,740
Start!

211
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,280
It is what that?

212
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,600
Do Sanji, you want the title of better chief of East Blue?

213
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,770
Imbecile, it is at all that.

214
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,990
I want to pose the hand on the fish which is over there.

215
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,780
The fish?

216
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,650
Oh, it is this special fish…

217
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,300
Ouais, to find the secrecies of this fish
will not be at all a play of child.

218
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,840
And here the so much awaited final!

219
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,530
They have all the air excited!

220
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,440
It is clear!

221
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,760
An amazing talent and tastes,
arrived up to now without the least fear… Sanji!

222
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,960
A dance envoûtante, having beaten up to now
all its adversaries… Carmen!

223
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,960
Who of both will gain the price this year?

224
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,030
And now, that the final starts!

225
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,130
Washing!

226
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,070
It left!

227
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,250
With the first glance,
its movements appear complicated to us.

228
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,640
However, it makes only a little personalized basic gestures!

229
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,880
How will react Sanji?

230
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,390
It paid not attention there.

231
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,080
Contrary, it handles to perfection its knives!

232
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,960
As so of nothing was not,
it continues to cook peacefully.

233
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,050
Sanji-Senshu!

234
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,050
Senshu means “Champion”

235
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,940
It exists!
It exists, it is certain!

236
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,680
What is this you tell,
species of imbecile?

237
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,920
It is you the imbecile,
was not necessary to tell that with the kid!

238
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,510
I am not a kid, species of jerk!

239
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,400
Calm yourself, Sanji!

240
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,530
There are not time to listen your are delirious!

241
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,820
Stop, will wash these plates in the place!

242
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,340
I know

243
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,190
that something of such should not exist.

244
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,830
North Blue. South Blue.
East Blue. West Blue.

245
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,640
Red Line which crosses North towards the South

246
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,530
and Large Line which traverses Is in the West.

247
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,810
There does not exist any other ocean besides these quatre-là.

248
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,290
Would a sea where all the fish of the world live together?

249
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,410
To tell the truth, that seems impossible.

250
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,650
Despite everything, it exists.
I am sure!

251
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,770
It is true. If not how to explain them
fish of West Blue… and this tuna-elephant?

252
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,450
When the old man had spoken about “possibilities”,
he wanted to surely say that!

253
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,110
I knew it. If it exists
I must seek it in Grand Line!

254
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,860
I insane of time that will take to me!

255
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,530
I will discover it one day!

256
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,950
Legendary Sea…

257
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,830
All Blue!

258
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,720
Sanji seems to be arrived at the final phase!

259
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,650
Carmen also seems to be returned at the same point.

260
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,560
What a atmosphere!

261
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,670
Only one will receive the tuna-elephant!
But which?

262
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,230
It remains little of time…

263
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,540
and it is finished!!!

264
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,690
Sanji-Senshu finished its preparation,

265
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,500
follow-up by Carmen-senshu, of which all dishes
are ready for the final judgment!

266
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,440
They finished both.

267
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,430
And now,
who will receive the first price?

268
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,290
Now I will announce the results.

269
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,070
For the contest of kitchen of this year,
the winner is…

270
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,130
San…
Wait!

271
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,200
I…

272
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,450
I… I will never forgive myself it.

273
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,920
I wanted a duel against you since so a long time.

274
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,770
This is why I worked without slackening to improve me.

275
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,800
I wanted to divide the same title as you.

276
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,130
For this day, 10 years ago,

277
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,280
your dream did not change at all!

278
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,320
I thought of being able to beat you. I cannot forgive myself to have been also arrogant!

279
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:12,190
I lost, your kitchen was delicious.

280
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,380
The best chief of East Blue, it is you Sanji.

281
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,060
Really?

282
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,500
After having intended Carmen-San to say these words,
I am really with the paradise!

283
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,980
Still!

284
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,750
What you does ace made with my face, salt dwarf?

285
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,480
I acknowledge myself overcome today.

286
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,730
But the next time it will have more to be prepared!

287
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,940
I will not lose any more.

288
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,030
If it is a challenge coming from Carmen-San,
I will accept it with pleasure.

289
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,580
Winner:Sanji-Senshu!!

290
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,280
Ah, it was interesting!

291
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,230
There are many duels today…

292
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,800
Say, why I must carry the heaviest part?

293
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,010
Ah, in fact, this tuna-elephant,

294
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,380
I ask for myself which taste it A.

295
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,420
Do I have to make a soup of it?

296
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,600
And its ears then?

297
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,680
Ah, I must quickly return to cook it!

298
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,600
What is there, Nami?

299
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,470
The air changed.

300
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,320
Air?

301
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,940
It will rain!

302
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,160
Hein? With a similar time?

303
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,210
I am sure.
We dispatch!

304
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,950
Euh? Oh…

305
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,190
My hat!

306
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,500
Wait!!

307
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,080
Wait, Chapeau!!

308
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,420
Luffy?

309
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,240
Finally here you is, Hat!

310
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,590
I found it!

311
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,410
Lucky!

312
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,640
I found it. By here!

313
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,440
What? It is true?

314
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,840
It is over there?

315
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,440
Yes, as you predicted,

316
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,060
a man corresponding to his description
has just been seen on the place.

317
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,990
Well.

318
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,030
One hurries.

319
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,680
He finally left his hole.

320
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,810
Await me, kid…

321
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,620
Here thus what the Lord of the Pirates saw!

322
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,200
And after having seen that, he died!

1
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,940
I WILL NEVER GIVE UP THIS BOAT!

2
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,290
You become nutcase?!

3
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,320
You were influenced by a band of engineers!

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,350
People whom I knew…

5
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,209
Would have relied on the force of Merry…

6
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,430
Rather than to listen to these balivernes!

7
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,070
To drop like a poor old man.

8
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,629
And to believe captain… do not generate the good decisions?!

9
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,790
I badly judged you, Luffy!

10
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,629
He, wait, Usopp. Luffy also…

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,690
Keep silent yourself, Nami! I made my decision!

12
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,410
I will not change an opinion!

13
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,119
We will change this boat no matter what you say!

14
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,189
We will leave from here without Merry!

15
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,450
Listen, Luffy…

16
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,230
It is not by trailing the feet as that one leaves oneself there!

17
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,389
I cannot leave from here while giving up a companion!

18
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,699
Anything, a boat is not the same thing!

19
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,679
It is similar!

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,219
Merry is alive and still has forces!

21
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,859
You are in a hurry probably already to have your next boat!

22
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,249
Oi, the guys, remain calm!

23
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:50,669
You acted without reflecting!

24
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,839
Ca will not arrange anything to be irritated like that!

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,439
DECREE CA IMMEDIATELY!

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,430
Luffy!

27
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,539
Do not imagine you that you are the only one to spend a dirty moment!

28
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,099
One feels all the same thing!

29
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,039
It is not question of changing boat!

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,079
Of agreement, then if my decision is not liked…

31
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,710
You have only to leave this immediate boat…

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Sanji!

33
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,550
Bandage cretins.

34
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,420
You ridges what, there?!

35
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,640
One calms oneself! Did not say anything!

36
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,410
I am sorry.

37
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,439
I did not want to say that…

38
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,090
Not, they is good, Luffy.

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,780
You let speak your heart.

40
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,200
What?!

41
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,200
You do nothing but progress, by throwing the useless companions.

42
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,830
If you give up Merry…

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,700
Give up me with.

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,520
You does not want the weak one among you, isn't this?

45
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,880
Luffy…

46
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,450
You will become the Lord of the pirates.

47
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,160
But your ambitions are too large for me.

48
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,670
Oi, where you go, Usopp?!

49
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,080
Ca does not look at you.

50
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,940
I…

51
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,960
I leave this crew!

52
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,600
Usopp.

53
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,379
Wait, do not do that!

54
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,530
He, is turned over!

55
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,710
Luffy, I cannot remain any more in your company.

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,390
Afflicted for all the troubles that I brought to you.

57
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,910
The boat is your property, since which you are captain.

58
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,660
Then engagements against me.

59
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,130
Monkey D. Luffy.

60
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,720
ENGAGEMENTS me!

61
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,670
This evening, 10 hours, I will return.

62
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,720
Then we will fight for Merry.

63
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,889
I will beat you and recover Merry.

64
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,810
And…

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,890
This moment, we will not have anything any more to say to us.

66
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:36,270
Luffy VS Usopp!
The spirit of the combatants

67
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,340
I am Usopp, the chief of this village and I have a whole horde of pirates under my orders!

68
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,850
They regard me as…

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,630
Their chief, “Cap' Usopp silvering”!

70
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,600
Be too delirious for you, you!

71
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,370
Oi, insane steps of me!

72
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,410
I am a man of a great pride.

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,210
So much so that…

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,530
People calls me, “Usopp, to trust”!

75
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,319
Take care of you. One will find oneself again on the seas.

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
Why?

77
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,120
“Why”? You are really idiotic.

78
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,269
We will become pirate, we will meet surely ailleu…

79
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,650
What do you tell? Hurry to go up.

80
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,310
One is companion now, not?

81
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,399
I is the captain, it is that?!

82
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,580
Baka, I am the captain!

83
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,940
You had courage to come.

84
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,960
There is nothing to regret, it does not matter what it occurred.

85
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,470
Here the duel which you asked!

86
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,550
Of course.

87
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,250
Give all that you ace. I will overcome you.

88
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,890
I know already how I will beat you.

89
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,500
One can nothing make? Usopp is dirtily amoché.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,120
If you cannot see that, returns inside.

91
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,320
Remember that your enemy knows your force.

92
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,390
Luffy, we were a long time together.

93
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,490
I know your capacities well…

94
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,190
Would not be surprised if I say to you that…

95
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,710
I have 8000 men behind me!

96
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,710
Give up now if you want to live!

97
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,729
Quuoii?! 8000?!

98
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,470
I said to you that you should return.

99
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,569

Return inside.

It is brilliant. Also paint it on the sail.

185
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,500
Yosh, finished! Now, the boat pirates Going Merry is fine loan!

186
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,540
GOMU GOMU NO…

187
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,540
BULLET!

188
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,260
Usopp!

189
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,630
The combat is finished.

190
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,500
Imbecile!

191
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,480
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO NEVER BEAT ME!

192
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,640
I cannot believe it.

193
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,730
Do what you want of Merry,

194
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:03,160
We will get a new boat and will continue our voyage.

195
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,739
Oi, exchange your place with me, Luffy!

196
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,669
Not, this place is reserved to me!

197
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,420
Oh, it is what?!

198
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,339
What do you make, Usopp?

199
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,310
He! The shoes are strictly prohibited in the workshop of Usopp!

200
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,460
We will have absolutely to visit Elbaf…

201
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,319
The village of the giant warriors.

202
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,050
Yosh, Usopp, one will go absolutely!

203
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,249
One goes there, one goes there!

204
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,780
It is Gold Eve Festival!

205
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,640
Goodbye, Usopp.

206
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,250
One spent good moments together.

207
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,800
Oi, remains there, Chopper!

208
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,640
Why?! It endured that whereas its body was seriously wounded!

209
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,919
A combat is not a play!

210
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,099
And then?!

211
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,010
I am doctor! At least let to me go to look after it!

212
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,410
Think of dishonor that a man undergoes who loses a combat, then saves to him your pity!

213
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,240
Think of the sorrow which strikes the loser.

214
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,290
He asked this duel while knowing very well what he expected…

215
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,680
It is hard!

216
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,550
It is the burden of the captain.

217
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,980
Make your decision.

218
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,670
On which can one count if you hesitate?

219
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,600
Let us leave this boat…

220
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:42,040
We will not return any more on this ship.

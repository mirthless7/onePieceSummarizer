1
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:56,006
What's wrong with this restaurant?

2
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:56,715
What's wrong with this restaurant?

3
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:57,466
It's like...

4
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,468
It's like a pirate ship!

5
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:01,261
It's horrible!

6
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:02,930
Krieg's man escaped!

7
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,263
Krieg's man escaped!

8
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:09,311
This is a restaurant, isn't it?

9
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:09,645
This is a restaurant, isn't it?

10
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,939
Sir, do you have enough money?

11
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:12,231
Sir, do you have enough money?

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,732
How does a bullet sound?

13
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:14,274
How does a bullet sound?

14
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:14,650
How does a bullet sound?

15
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,984
So I take it that you don't have any.

16
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:16,235
So I take it that you don't have any.

17
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:16,360
So I take it that you don't have any.

18
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:22,560
Eat up.

19
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:27,579
Well now, I've found my cook!

20
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,247
Well now, I've found my cook!

21
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,374
This Is just great.

22
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,000
Old fart!

23
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,086
Why don't you just run off and
be a pirate just like them?

24
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:34,336
Why don't you just run off and
be a pirate just like them?

25
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,505
We don't need you here anymore!

26
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:37,005
We don't need you here anymore!

27
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:46,105
THE GREATEST PIRATE FLEET!
CAPTAIN DON KRIEG

28
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:49,560
Hey, old fart.

29
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,020
Ain't I the Assistant Head Chef here?

30
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,314
What's your crap of not needing me no more?

31
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,151
You always fight with our customers.

32
00:02:57,317 --> 00:03:00,112
You flirt with any beautiful woman in sight.

33
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,614
And you make lousy food.

34
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:05,534
You're nothing more than a
burden to this restaurant!

35
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,869
That's what I mean.

36
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,328
What the..?!

37
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,793
The other cooks don't like you anyway.

38
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,379
Why don't you just become a pirate
or whatever you please?

39
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:20,716
Why don't you just get the hell outta here!?

40
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,552
What's this crap?

41
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:28,640
I didn't do shit and now you're blowing
your head off, old fart?

42
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:31,101
I don't care about the rest of your excuses...

43
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:31,894
I don't care about the rest of your excuses...

44
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:32,686
But I'll never allow my cooking to be insulted!

45
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:32,936
But I'll never allow my cooking to be insulted!

46
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:34,354
But I'll never allow my cooking to be insulted!

47
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,982
I don't care what the hell you're gonna say...

48
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:38,650
I'm gonna stay right here as a chef!

49
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:38,942
I'm gonna stay right here as a chef!

50
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,569
If you don't like it, it's your problem!

51
00:03:40,903 --> 00:03:44,448
How dare you hit your own boss..!

52
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,032
You stupid eggplant!

53
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:46,992
You stupid eggplant!

54
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:50,871
Damnit.

55
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,875
Are you kiddin'?

56
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,503
No matter how hard you may try...

57
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:01,215
I'm gonna stay right here as a chef!

58
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,550
'Til the day you go to hell!

59
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,552
I won't die!

60
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:07,554
I'll live another 100 years!

61
00:04:07,763 --> 00:04:09,640
What a stubborn old man...

62
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,850
Isn't it great that he gave you his blessing!

63
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:12,226
Now you can come with us..!

64
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:12,851
Now you can come with us..!

65
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:13,685
Hell no!

66
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,687
Alright then.

67
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:17,773
Please pardon me for what has happened.

68
00:04:17,898 --> 00:04:20,943
As an apology, I've ordered you
a Fruit Macedonia, my Princess.

69
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,945
Why, thank you.

70
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:24,363
You're so kind.

71
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:24,905
It's nothing.

72
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,241
What's this? You're not apologizing to us?

73
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:29,243
I'll sue you, you love cook!

74
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,371
I've brough you some tea, isn't that enough?

75
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,164
You should thank me, long nose.

76
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:35,666
Huh? Picking a fight?

77
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,084
I won't be easy on you!

78
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:37,334
I won't be easy on you!

79
00:04:37,835 --> 00:04:39,002
Get him, Zoro!

80
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,629
Do it yourself.

81
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:43,149
Please, don't fight over me!

82
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,149
Very well, Ma'am. I'll stop.

83
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,051
Who's fighting over you?!

84
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,678
By the way...

85
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:48,262
Huh?

86
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,514
The food here's great, but...

87
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,016
it's a bit expensive for me.

88
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,309
Of course, I won't make you pay...

89
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:54,435
Of course, I won't make you pay...

90
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,436
Thank you!

91
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,980
You guys have to.

92
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:01,024
I already saw that coming.

93
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,404
Hey, why are you slacking off here for?

94
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:07,739
Go give the guests towels when they come in!

95
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:08,824
Yes, Sir.

96
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:21,044
Man... it's already been four days.

97
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:21,753
Man... it's already been four days.

98
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,840
I'm getting fed up with this place.

99
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,801
How soon can we leave, ya think?

100
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:29,136
Beats me.

101
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:33,432
You don't think he'll really be stuck
here for a year, do you?

102
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:34,433
Why not?

103
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:37,060
We've got free food, a cozy atmosphere...

104
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,520
You're the only one!

105
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:42,024
Hey, Luffy!

106
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:42,107
Hey, Luffy!

107
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:43,233
Huh?

108
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,235
What's up with you?

109
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,196
Hurry up and get out of this mess!

110
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:49,198
Ah, can't you guys wait just a bit longer..?

111
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,909
I'll try talking to the boss again.

112
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,911
Please do!

113
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,104
Hey now, what's the matter?

114
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:44,461
The flag that turns brave men into chickens..!

115
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,213
That flag is...

116
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,215
That flag is...

117
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:49,716
No doubt about it.

118
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,802
It's the King of East Blue...

119
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:51,969
It's the King of East Blue...

120
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,763
It's Don Krieg!

121
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:55,097
It's Don Krieg!

122
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:09,903
Why?!

123
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,489
What's Krieg doing here?

124
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:12,531
What's Krieg doing here?

125
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,199
Look well, Patty!

126
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:15,701
They're really here!

127
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,828
You'll help us drive 'em away, now won't you?!

128
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,746
C-Couldn't you be mistaken?!

129
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,583
He's the leader of a 5000 pirate ship fleet.

130
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,919
Why's he coming all this way
to avenge a single man?

131
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,296
There's no mistake!

132
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,298
He's really here!

133
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,799
Hey, we oughta get outta here ourselves!

134
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,717
Hey, we oughta get outta here ourselves!

135
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,010
Hey, we oughta get outta here ourselves!

136
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:34,803
That ship's huge!

137
00:07:34,803 --> 00:07:35,012
That ship's huge!

138
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:44,313
That's what I call a ship!

139
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,357
You think that Gin guy's here to pay you back?

140
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:49,359
I doubt it.

141
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:50,861
But it's strange...

142
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:01,663
Hey...

143
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:03,207
What?

144
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:13,717
Looks like his ship's pretty much had it.

145
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:16,470
It doesn't look like it was attacked
by a gunboat or anything...

146
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:16,845
It doesn't look like it was attacked
by a gunboat or anything...

147
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,432
But it doesn't look like any human
could have done that either.

148
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,434
A tornado maybe?

149
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,979
Here he comes.

150
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,118
Please...

151
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:25,330
Can you give me water... and something to eat?

152
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,208
If it's money, I've got it.

153
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,210
As much as you ask.

154
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:35,716
I don't know how long it's been
since I've last eaten...

155
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,009
Please...

156
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,845
Give me water and something to eat.

157
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:40,220
Give me water and something to eat.

158
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,056
Please.

159
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,061
W-What's wrong with him?

160
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,063
He doesn't look very dreadful to me.

161
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:54,610
Is this guy really the most dreadful
pirate, Don Krieg?

162
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:56,945
He looks hungry.

163
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:03,952
C-captain!

164
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:06,997
Don Krieg!

165
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,375
P-please!

166
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:12,294
Please help my captain!

167
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,630
He's starving to death!

168
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,341
He hasn't eaten for days...

169
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,343
If he doesn't get food soon, he'll die!

170
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:29,353
This is great!

171
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:33,774
So this is the notorious bully, Don Krieg?

172
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:35,109
We've got money this time!

173
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:36,819
Aren't we customers here?!

174
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:38,821
Not in your life!

175
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:41,406
Hey, hurry up and call the Marines.

176
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:41,990
What?

177
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,744
He has weakened. They won't
get another chance like this.

178
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,329
No food for him!

179
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,330
Get him out of here.

180
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,415
That's right!

181
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:53,001
If he gets better, there's no telling what he'll do next!

182
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,586
He's done so many awful things.

183
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,046
He deserves to be caught, even if he's starving!

184
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,799
He's never done anything good in his life!

185
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:03,011
He might even attack this boat if he gets better!

186
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,639
We shouldn't even hand him a glass of water!

187
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,643
I won't... do anything.

188
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,480
I won't do anything.

189
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:18,152
I promise, I'll leave after I eat.

190
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:21,864
So please... h-help me...

191
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,867
Don Krieg, please stop!

192
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,244
Please don't beg!

193
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,137
How can you do such a humble act?

194
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,999
Please stop it!

195
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,584
I promise.

196
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:35,586
Please...

197
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,297
Anything... even your leftovers..

198
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,633
Anything!

199
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:45,429
Don...

200
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:54,772
Heh, you think I'm sympathetic?

201
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,523
Outta the way, Patty.

202
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:05,324
Sa...

203
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,534
Sanji-san!

204
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,164
Take it, Gin.

205
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:14,166
Let him have it.

206
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:17,628
Sanji-san.

207
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:24,718
Thanks!

208
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:36,939
Hey, Sanji!

209
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,941
Take away the food!

210
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:42,027
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

211
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:46,865
He's the King of the East Blue,
the sneakiest pirate of 'em all!

212
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,410
It all began in prison.

213
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:53,122
The guy pretended to be one of the marines..

214
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,290
He killed the captain of his ship..

215
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:59,294
And took over that ship to become a pirate!

216
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:03,966
Sometimes he'd raise a Marine
flag and enter a harbor,

217
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,168
Then he'd attack the city and other docked ships.

218
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,929
Or he'd pretend to surrender, and
then make surprise attacks.

219
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,640
He'll do anything to win!

220
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,684
That's how he got to where he is now!

221
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,271
What? So he's a snake, eh?

222
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,165
He shouldn't be underestimated, even now!

223
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,192
Eat and leave?

224
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,611
How can we believe what he says?

225
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:29,450
We'd be doing the world a favor
if we gave this wretch up!

226
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,213
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

227
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:50,279
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

228
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,202
S-Sanji!

229
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,380
Aren't you acting different from
what you promised, Don Krieg?

230
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:37,426
You promised that you'd never hurt
these people, so I took you here.

231
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:41,555
Besides, that man saved our lives!

232
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,686
Yeah, it was good.

233
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,231
I feel re-energized.

234
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,377
What's going on in the restaurant?

235
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:13,795
Let's go check it out.

236
00:15:13,837 --> 00:15:15,797
What?! You serious?!

237
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,549
What's wrong? You scared?

238
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:19,551
Huh, don't be silly!

239
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,930
Strange...

240
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,451
l can't see anybody on that ship.

241
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,915
Isn't this a nice restaurant?

242
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,709
I'll take it!

243
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:56,755
So...

244
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:58,632
That's why you came...

245
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,689
My ship's ruined.

246
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:16,566
I want a new one.

247
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:20,988
Leave after you've gotten your things.

248
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,656
W-what?

249
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:23,949
Don Krieg...

250
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,243
That's not what you promised...

251
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:33,542
There're about 100 men still alive on that ship.

252
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,086
All of 'em starving and injured.

253
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:40,257
First, prepare food and water for 100 men.

254
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:41,883
Some of 'em have already...

255
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,304
...starved to death.

256
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:49,808
Water...

257
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,229
Right away!

258
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,025
We'd know better that those pirates
will be attacking us later on!

259
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,277
We won't aid them!

260
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:01,945
We refuse!

261
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:03,780
Refuse?

262
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:05,782
Don't misunderstand.

263
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,036
I'm not ordering food.

264
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,620
I'm giving you an order.

265
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,706
Nobody..

266
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,207
ever...

267
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,253
Disobeys me!

268
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,345
Sanji-san.

269
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:29,723
Sanji-san, I'm sorry.

270
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,933
I didn't mean for this to happen.

271
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:36,647
Bastard! Look what you've done!

272
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,107
Hey, Sanji!
Where're ye off to?!

273
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,129
The kitchen.

274
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,758
I've gotta prepare food for 100 men.

275
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,760
Sanji-san!

276
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:07,427
Sanji!

277
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,638
WHAT?!!

278
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:11,807
Yes.

279
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:13,809
That's how it should be.

280
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,989
You're being Krieg's little puppet, Sanji!

281
00:18:27,197 --> 00:18:29,116
I'll never let you get into the kitchen!

282
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,868
I've had enough of your nonsense!

283
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:35,747
Do it.

284
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:39,392
If you wanna stop me, do so.

285
00:18:42,963 --> 00:18:44,047
I'm aware.

286
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:48,510
I know that he's a hopeless bully.

287
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:54,074
But that's none of my business.

288
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,060
I don't care.

289
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,855
I don't care what happens after they had their meal.

290
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,598
Not a care in the world.

291
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,241
I'm a chef.

292
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,152
Nothing more.

293
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:08,447
When people are hungry, I offer them food.

294
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,856
That's all there is to it.

295
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,384
For a chef,

296
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,619
Isn't that enough?

297
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:23,628
Patty!

298
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,714
Hey, take him outta here!

299
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:27,716
Sanji.

300
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,968
You've often given food

301
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,471
to the customers that I drove away, haven't you?

302
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,199
I don't care who's right or wrong,

303
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:38,727
but I can't allow this to happen.

304
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:41,329
I can't let you do as you please anymore.

305
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:42,898
I'll protect this restaurant.

306
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:43,982
I'll protect this restaurant.

307
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,084
Luckily, there's only one enemy.

308
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,863
What can alone Don Krieg do to all of us?

309
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:55,243
Pirates come to this floating restaurant everyday.

310
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,955
I'm always prepared for anything.

311
00:19:59,289 --> 00:19:59,915
That's...

312
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:03,543
Did you enjoy your meal, Krieg-san?

313
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:04,503
How about it?

314
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:06,088
Since you've finished your meal...

315
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:10,784
How about some metal for dessert?!

316
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:16,148
SYRUP MEATBALL!

317
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,698
Don!

318
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:40,414
I think I broke the door.

319
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,499
The boss will be mad at me for that.

320
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,701
It's ok. We're protecting this place.

321
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:46,077
It's no major damage.

322
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,340
What are we gonna do about
those people on Krieg's ship?

323
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:51,842
I dunno...

324
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,845
Why don't we just put some butter
on their ship and cook it up?

325
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:02,019
That sounds...

326
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,937
delicious.

327
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,815
Stupid cook.

328
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:11,153
Giving me such an awful dessert...

329
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,447
This restaurant's despicable!

330
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,495
DESPICABLE!

331
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,378
That armor...

332
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:29,671
It can shoot?

333
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:46,563
Do as I say!

334
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,775
I'm the strongest man there is!

335
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:53,362
These arms are stronger than anybody's!

336
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:56,323
My super-alloy armor is...

337
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:00,202
Tougher than anything!

338
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:05,874
And I've got a Diamond Punch,
which can destroy everything!

339
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,959
An army of 5000 men!

340
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:11,171
I've never lost a battle in my life!

341
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:15,884
I'm the perfect person to claim the title of 'Don'!

342
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,503
Out of the way, boy.

343
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,142
I ordered you to get the food ready!

344
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:26,979
Now hurry up and do it!

345
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:29,606
Nobody disobeys me!

346
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:37,739
Here's food for 100 men.

347
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,117
Help him get it on the ship.

348
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,451
Owner Zeff!

349
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:43,578
What's the old man doing?

350
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,205
Isn't that a little risky?

351
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,503
Z-Zeff is it?

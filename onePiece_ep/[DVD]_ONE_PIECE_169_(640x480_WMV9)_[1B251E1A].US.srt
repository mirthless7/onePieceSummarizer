Those guys... They went and got lost.

128
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:47,618
I'll just head to the ruins and wait for them.

129
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,453
I'll just head to the ruins and wait for them.

130
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,205
I have to go directly south,

131
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,457
And that's the direction that feels the warmest!

132
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:53,582
And that's the direction that feels the warmest!

139
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,213
At the same time,

140
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:06,313
Wiper and the Shandian warriors were
on their way to God's Shrine to defeat Enel.

141
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,951
But, using his all-seeing Mantra,

142
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:12,851
Enel had the Priests open their
Ordeals across the whole island.

143
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:12,977
The survival game has begun.

144
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:13,185

When we first met,

151
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:36,583
I acted as a mercenary because you people of
the Blue Sea are unabIe to combat sky warfare.

152
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,793
Sky warfare...

153
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:38,794
What the heck's that?

154
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:41,588
Hm, perhaps if you move that barrel over here.

155
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,382
Barrel?

156
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,304
Now watch.

157
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:52,057
Why are we doing this?

158
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,767
You will soon see.

159
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,185
Hit that shell as hard as you can.

160
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,437
Hit that shell as hard as you can.

161
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,814
Be gentle, Sanji.

162
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:02,401
If you put another hole in the deck,
I'm gonna put a hole in you!

163
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,444
Hit as hard as you can!

Don't abuse other people's ships!

169
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:04,820

00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:06,447
Don't abuse other people's ships!

176
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:06,947
Don't abuse other people's ships!

177
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:07,197
Don't abuse other people's ships!

178
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:07,823
Don't abuse other people's ships!

179
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:08,532
Don't abuse other people's ships!

180
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:10,784
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

181
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:10,909
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

182
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:11,034
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

183
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:11,160
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

184
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,285
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

185
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:11,410
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

186
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:11,535
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

187
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:11,660
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

188
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:11,785
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

189
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:11,994
Well, if you're sure, here goes.

190
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:13,704
Wait! Wait! Wait!

191
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,039
You don't need to wind up into it!

192
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,256
What was that?

193
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:27,551
I know I told you to hold back, but that was just sad.

194
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:30,762
You didn't even crack the barrel underneath it.

195
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:35,225
No... I put everything I had into it.

196
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:37,811
Like I was trying to put a hole in the deck.

197
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,687
OI!

198
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:43,817
It was like the shell absorbed the impact.

199
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,861
Huh?

200
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:53,285
Now, face the shell's holes toward
the barrel and press the apex.

201
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:54,995
You know how to press it, I believe.

202
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,830
You know how to press it, I believe.

203
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:56,955
You know how to press it, I believe.

204
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:58,248
You know how to press it, I believe.

205
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:01,376
Here, right?

206
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:01,502
Here, right?

207
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,461
Here, right?

208
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:02,586
Here, right?

209
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:02,794
Here, right?

210
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:19,561
That is an Impact Dial.

211
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:19,686
That is an Impact Dial.

212
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,437
That is an Impact Dial.

213
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:20,562
That is an Impact Dial.

214
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:20,938
That is an Impact Dial.

215
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:21,063
That is an Impact Dial.

216
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:21,313
That is an Impact Dial.

217
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:21,438
That is an Impact Dial.

218
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:21,730
That is an Impact Dial.

219
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,147
That is an Impact Dial.

220
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:25,108
It absorbs impacts inflicted upon it and
then releases the energy when pressed.

221
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:25,234
It absorbs impacts inflicted upon it and
then releases the energy when pressed.

222
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:25,734
It absorbs impacts inflicted upon it and
then releases the energy when pressed.

223
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:26,235
It absorbs impacts inflicted upon it and
then releases the energy when pressed.

224
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,653
It absorbs impacts inflicted upon it and
then releases the energy when pressed.

225
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:28,070
It's often affixed onto the palm
with a glove or a bandage.

226
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,033
It's often affixed onto the palm
with a glove or a bandage.

227
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:38,372
With a direct hit, it has enough
power to kill a normal human.

228
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:38,872
With a direct hit, it has enough
power to kill a normal human.

229
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:43,377
Usopp, this thing...

230
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,964
Yeah, that dango Priest was using one!

231
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:47,047
Yeah, that dango Priest was using one!

232
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:47,881
Yeah, that dango Priest was using one!

233
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:57,391
It isn't a punch.

234
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:02,729
But why didn't you say so!? That scared
the hell outta me, old man!

235
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:08,568
I have also heard that in ancient times...

236
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:16,702
The Reject Dial was to uted as releasing
10 times the power of the Impact Dial.

237
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:25,919
But, that overwhelming power was a ou le edged
sword which also jeo ardized the life of the user.

238
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:30,632
As can be expected, it was rare y used.

239
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,473
Are you telling us there's shells that dangerous!?

240
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:39,891
They're like weapons!

241
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:44,104
I thought Dials were just everyday things.

242
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,148
They are.

243
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:53,155
But anything that is thought to be convenient will
have a way to be miss used for harmful purposes.

244
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:54,114
The effects depend on the person who uses them.

245
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:54,281
The effects depend on the person who uses them.

246
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:54,656
The effects depend on the person who uses them.

247
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:54,781
The effects depend on the person who uses them.

248
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,615
The effects depend on the person who uses them.

249
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:59,536
Dials are very useful.

250
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:04,583
But when used in battle, their power can be drawn forth.

251
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:09,588
For exampIe, the Heat iaI used for cooking...

252
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:14,176
...can be placed inside a lance and used to produce heat.

253
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,428
It then becomes a pyro lance
The Heat Javelin.

254
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:18,430
Or the Flames Dial which stores fires.

255
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:18,555
Or the Flames Dial which stores fires.

256
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,755
Or the Flames Dial which stores fires.

257
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:25,231
Like the Priest you see using it before...

258
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,231
Yeah, Chopper told us about him.

259
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,192
And that's sky warfare?

260
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:31,485
Yes.

261
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:38,325
Those from the Blue Sea who do not know
of Dials cannot see through these tricks.

262
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,119
There are also the many forms of manufactured clouds.

263
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:45,332
The Priests have forged them
into forms they can controI.

264
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,126
Anyone unaware of them will be helpless against them.

265
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:54,466
Then, is there something behind that Mantra
thing that guy used to predict our moves?

266
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:56,468
Mantra...

267
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:56,718
Mantra...

268
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:56,843
Mantra...

269
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,469
Mantra...

270
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:57,636
Mantra...

271
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:57,928
Mantra...

272
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:57,969
I myself am unable to use it.

273
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:58,094
I myself am unable to use it.

274
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:58,220
I myself am unable to use it.

275
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,345
I myself am unable to use it.

276
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:58,470
I myself am unable to use it.

277
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,595
I myself am unable to use it.

278
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:58,720
I myself am unable to use it.

279
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:58,845
I myself am unable to use it.

280
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:58,970
I myself am unable to use it.

281
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,095
I myself am unable to use it.

282
00:07:59,095 --> 00:07:59,221
I myself am unable to use it.

283
00:07:59,221 --> 00:07:59,346
I myself am unable to use it.

284
00:07:59,346 --> 00:07:59,471
I myself am unable to use it.

285
00:07:59,471 --> 00:07:59,596
I myself am unable to use it.

286
00:07:59,596 --> 00:07:59,721
I myself am unable to use it.

287
00:07:59,721 --> 00:07:59,846
I myself am unable to use it.

288
00:07:59,846 --> 00:07:59,971
I myself am unable to use it.

289
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:00,096
I myself am unable to use it.

290
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:00,222
I myself am unable to use it.

291
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:00,347
I myself am unable to use it.

292
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:00,472
I myself am unable to use it.

293
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:00,722
I myself am unable to use it.

294
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:00,847
I myself am unable to use it.

295
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:00,972
I myself am unable to use it.

296
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:01,473
I myself am unable to use it.

297
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:01,765
I myself am unable to use it.

298
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:01,806
It is rather difficult to expIain.

299
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:02,224
It is rather difficult to expIain.

300
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:02,349
It is rather difficult to expIain.

301
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:02,474
It is rather difficult to expIain.

302
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:02,724
It is rather difficult to expIain.

303
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:02,849
It is rather difficult to expIain.

304
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,225
It is rather difficult to expIain.

305
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:03,350
It is rather difficult to expIain.

306
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,975
It is rather difficult to expIain.

307
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:04,267
It is rather difficult to expIain.

308
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:08,522
Mantra is known as the power to hear.

309
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:13,735
It seems that as long as a person
lives, their body emits a voice.

310
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:14,611
A voice?

311
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:14,736
A voice?

312
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:14,861
A voice?

313
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:14,986
A voice?

314
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:15,111
A voice?

315
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:15,153
A voice?

316
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:20,700
Yes. By hearing that, you are able
to know your opponent's next move.

317
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,039
With training, one can even hear
those voices over a large area.

318
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:26,498
With training, one can even hear
those voices over a large area.

319
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:26,540
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:28,959
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

352
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,000
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

353
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,042
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

354
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:29,084
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

355
00:08:29,084 --> 00:08:29,209
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

356
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:29,251
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

357
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:30,126
The Priests can hear across all of Upper Yard.

358
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:30,418
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

359
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:30,460
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

360
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:30,710
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

361
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,752
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

362
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,002
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

363
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:31,086
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

364
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:35,048
Enel is able to hear across this entire land.

365
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,552
The nature of that power is unknown.

366
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:45,141
Because of it, the people here
will never have a peaceful day.

367
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,353
I wonder if they've made it down yet...

368
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:51,314
Yes, they are lying in wait.

369
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,901
The three Priests have set their Ordeals.

370
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,154
And Chief Enforcer Yama has taken
the 50 Enforcers with him.

371
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:01,783
God, this has become an all out war.

372
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:06,505
Is it really necessary to be this extreme?

373
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:10,041
The Shandians and a few Blue Sea dwellers
are hardly worthy adversaries.

374
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:13,586
But a festival should be exciting.

375
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:13,712
But a festival should be exciting.

376
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:14,212
But a festival should be exciting.

377
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:14,337
But a festival should be exciting.

378
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:14,838
But a festival should be exciting.

379
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:14,963
But a festival should be exciting.

380
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:15,463
But a festival should be exciting.

381
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:15,547
But a festival should be exciting.

382
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:16,089
But a festival should be exciting.

383
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:16,214
But a festival should be exciting.

384
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:16,673
But a festival should be exciting.

385
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:23,471
And you... are underestimating
the potential warfare.

386
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:23,513
And you... are underestimating
the potential warfare.

387
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:23,756
And you... are underestimating
the potential warfare.

388
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:25,140
Potential?

389
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes, exactly.

390
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,769
You'll see soon enough.

391
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,440
Banana.

392
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,526
Now then...

393
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:41,906
Our forces are comprised of the 50 Enforcers and the 3 Priests.

394
00:09:41,906 --> 00:09:43,324
Including me, that makes 54.

395
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:43,908
Including me, that makes 54.

396
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:52,667
There are 20 Shandians heading toward the island.

397
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,462
Or, wait, it's only 3.

398
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,672
That old man can't fight anymore.

399
00:09:57,672 --> 00:10:00,091
All together, there are 81.

400
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:02,969
This will be a battle to see who is left standind.

401
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:05,388
Shall we guess how many will have
collapsed in three hours?

402
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:09,017
Shall we guess how many will have
collapsed in three hours?

403
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:09,601
Shall we guess how many will have
collapsed in three hours?

404
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:12,604
My word, are you starting on that sort of game aIready?

405
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,439
Come on, lighten up.

406
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,107
Oi, you take a guess.

407
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:16,357
What? Y-You mean me?

408
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:16,733
What? Y-You mean me?

409
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,108
What? Y-You mean me?

410
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:17,358
What? Y-You mean me?

411
00:10:17,358 --> 00:10:17,484
What? Y-You mean me?

412
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:17,859
What? Y-You mean me?

413
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:18,234
What? Y-You mean me?

414
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:18,610
What? Y-You mean me?

415
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:18,985
What? Y-You mean me?

416
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:19,360
What? Y-You mean me?

417
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:19,736
Please, I know nothing of such things...

418
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,111
Please, I know nothing of such things...

419
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:20,487
Please, I know nothing of such things...

420
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:20,862
Please, I know nothing of such things...

421
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:21,237
Please, I know nothing of such things...

422
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:21,613
Please, I know nothing of such things...

423
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:21,988
Please, I know nothing of such things...

424
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:22,363
Please, I know nothing of such things...

425
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:22,739
Please, I know nothing of such things...

426
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:22,864
Please, I know nothing of such things...

427
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:22,989
Please, I know nothing of such things...

428
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,239
Please, I know nothing of such things...

429
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:23,907
Please, I know nothing of such things...

430
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:26,409
Huh? What's wrong with you?

431
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:26,618
You're no fun.

432
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:26,868
You're no fun.

433
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:26,993
You're no fun.

434
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:27,243
You're no fun.

435
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:27,368
You're no fun.

436
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:27,744
You're no fun.

437
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:27,994
You're no fun.

438
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:28,036
You're no fun.

439
00:10:28,036 --> 00:10:28,119
Just take a guess. Any guess.

440
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:28,369
Just take a guess. Any guess.

441
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:28,495
Just take a guess. Any guess.

442
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:28,870
Just take a guess. Any guess.

443
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,245
Just take a guess. Any guess.

444
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:29,496
Just take a guess. Any guess.

445
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:29,621
Just take a guess. Any guess.

446
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:29,996
Just take a guess. Any guess.

447
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,246
Just take a guess. Any guess.

448
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:30,371
Just take a guess. Any guess.

449
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:30,580
Just take a guess. Any guess.

450
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,583
Then you.

451
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,675
O...Okay...

452
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:43,585
What I know is the 50 enforcers and
the Three Priest are really well trained...

453
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:44,969
They are not easy to take down,

454
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:45,136
They are not easy to take down,

455
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:45,178
They are not easy to take down,

456
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:45,220
They are not easy to take down,

457
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,804
They are not easy to take down,

458
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:45,929
They are not easy to take down,

459
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:46,054
They are not easy to take down,

460
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:46,095
They are not easy to take down,

461
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:46,179
They are not easy to take down,

462
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,222
They are not easy to take down,

463
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:47,263
They are not easy to take down,

464
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:47,472
They are not easy to take down,

465
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:50,934
But the enemy possesses enough
power to rival the Priests.

466
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,393
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

467
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:53,144
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

468
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:53,186
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

469
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:53,228
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

470
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:53,269
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

471
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,353
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

472
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:53,394
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

473
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:53,436
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

474
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:53,561
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

475
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:56,397
In three hours, I believe 30 will fall, making it...

476
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,297
Or maybe 50...

477
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:01,736
I see! 50 is it?

478
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:02,111
I see! 50 is it?

479
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:02,237
I see! 50 is it?

480
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:02,362
I see! 50 is it?

481
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:02,862
I see! 50 is it?

482
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,238
I see! 50 is it?

483
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:03,488
I see! 50 is it?

484
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:03,655
I see! 50 is it?

485
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:04,656
I see! 50 is it?

486
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:08,409
But isn't that a bit high?

487
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:11,037
You're not taking this battle seriously.

488
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,419
Then, what you think God?

489
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:19,337
very well, I'll ive you the definitive answer.

490

very well, I'll ive you the definitive answer.

514
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,300
In three hours, out of the 81 people
on this island, there will be...

515
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,052
In three hours, out of the 81 people
on this island, there will be...

516
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:26,761
In three hours, out of the 81 people

520
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,057
5 left.

521
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:31,391
5 left.

522
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,964
What?

523
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,300
My body...

524
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,369
W-What!?

525
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:10,930
I cant move!

526
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,100
Yo, honored guests from Shandia.

527
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,186
I rather like this picture.

528
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,232
I hope you enjoy my little party.

529
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:24,262
Shura.

530
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,322
You don't all have to say it.

531
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:29,532
I know my own name, at least.

532
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,163
This may seem brutal to you...

533
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:42,295
but this land, Upper Yard, is completely different environment from what it was last night.

534
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,215
You can't move.

535
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,967
Just stay right there.

536
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,803
You have a 3% chance of surviving...

537
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,998
...the Ordeal of String.

538
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:07,998
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

539
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:15,161
The Ordeal of String!?

540
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:20,625
It's a little late... to tell you to watch your step.

541
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,054
String Cloud!

542
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,623
So you found it...

543
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,264
I'm impressed...

544
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:35,306
I'm impressed...

545
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,310
It's spread throughout my area.

546
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,398
Too thin to be seen, but so strong, even the most massive of men cannot move once tangled...

547
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,275
Too thin to be seen, but so strong, even the most massive of men cannot move once tangled...

548
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,152
My mighty String Cloud.

549
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:49,237
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

550
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:49,362
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

551
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:49,862
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

552
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,532
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

553
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:52,615
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

554
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:53,199
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

555
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:53,366
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

556
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:53,449
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

557
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:54,200
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

558
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,826
You've been tangling yourselves in it since you entered the forest.

559
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:59,163
Take a look around.

560
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:01,207
Your bodies are covered in string!

561
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,293
This is what it means to pay for your mistakes!

562
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:09,924
Except...

563
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,717
I think someone's peeking!

564
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:14,303
Fly, Fuza!

565
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,058
Wiper!

566
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,188
You can't best me in mid-air!

567
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,691
Watch out!

568
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,159
That's a Heat Javelin!

569
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,994
Why did you throw away your shield and weapon!?

570
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:39,120
Are you insane!?

571
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:41,873
Don't tell me...

572
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:45,793
You can have it...

573
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:46,210
You can have it...

574
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,544
You can have it...

575
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:46,961
You can have it...

576
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:47,211
You can have it..

577
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:49,797
...if one shoulder is all you want

578
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,345
An Impact?

579
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,847
That's not enough to kill me!

580
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,515
No, 10 times that energy!

581
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:00,141
No, 10 times that energy!

582
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,809
No, 10 times that energy!

583
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:04,386
REJECT!

584
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:38,387
Upper Yard Survival, 1 has fallen.

585
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:41,032
80 remain.

586
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:45,353
The first battle has caused quite a bit of disarray.

587
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:46,896
Shura has been defeated.

588
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:49,190
W-What? Shura-sama?

589
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,860
Shura also underestimated sky warfare.

590
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,111
The fool!

591
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,950
But, is this not a crisis?

592
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,952
No Priest has been defeated in six years!

593
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:04,789
And now they have lost two of their number in the past two days!

594
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:05,956
Yes!

595
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:08,626
Nothing can be done about their defeat.

596
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,297
I guess they were without divine protection.

597
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,513
Listen up, you guys!

598
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,433
We are going into battle against 20 Shandrians and 7 Blue Sea dwellers.

599
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,976
They pose no threat.

600
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:28,979
They will be no bother to the Priests.

601
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,940
Go forth and wreak havoc!

602
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,191
Go forth and wreak havoc!

603
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:35,820
SKYPIEA
50 ENFORCERS

604
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:43,661
Only those who will step over their fallen comrades and continue on should follow me !

605
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:47,961
It's the only way for defeating Enel !

606
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:57,925
Once we take out Enel, there will be no reason to yearn a bag of Vearth.

607
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:08,125
There will be no reason...

608
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:21,157
Wiper! Are you trying to kill yourself!?

609
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:24,535
Just try and use the Reject Dial one more time!

610
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:26,745
You'll blow your body to pieces!

611
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,089
What about my body?

612
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,341
Isn't this what you would call resolve?

613
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,760
If that's all you're thinking about,

614
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,804
You'll never beat them!

615
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,657
Crazy bastard...

616
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:05,868
What are you standing around for?

617
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,203
Braham!

618
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,165
We're in enemy territory.

619
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,499
Let's split up.

620
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,543
There are still two Priests left.

621
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,380
It seems they've increased the size of their Ordeal areas.

622
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:22,384
We don't want everyone getting caught in the same Ordeal again.

623
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,012
We have to be smarter than that.

624
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,097
I'm going ahead!

625
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:31,435
Fine!

626
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:32,811
Do what you want!

627
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,064
But I'll at least pray for everyone's safety!

628
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,985
Okay, guys, watch yourselves!

629
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:42,154
We'll meet at God's Shrine!

630
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:00,881
Who're you!?

631
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:01,757
What did you do!?

632
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,134
Heso!

633
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:05,302
An Enforcer!

634
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:06,261
Correct!

635
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:12,309
In the name of God Enel, we have been ordered to purge Upper Yard!

636
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:17,231
We are the Enforcer Elite 50! There is nowhere to hide!

637
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:23,529
We possess the power of the Axe Dial not found in Skypiea!

638
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,073
Lousy pest!

639
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:30,869
Deeper! Sharper!

640
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:33,831
AXE DIAL!

641
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:36,750
Your shield is useless!

642
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:03,735
The islands in the south~ are warm~

643
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,822
Paina-purupuru~ Their heads get really hot~

644
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,700
And they're all idiots!~

645
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,036
A goat?

646
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:14,788
Was that a goat?

647
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:15,372
Where is it?

648
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,502
A goat in the woods?

649
00:20:31,305 --> 00:20:32,848
Who's this jerk?

650
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,766
He got my hopes up!

651
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,227
I really wanted to see a goat!

652
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:41,857
Second verse!

653
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:46,778
The island in the north~ are cold~

654
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,907
Hyakkoi-koikoi~ Their heads shiver all around~

655
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:53,076
And they're all idiots~

656
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,206
Huh? You...

657
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,417
You...

658
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,878
What are you doing here?

659
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,340
I warned you to leave this island.

660
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,466
Shut up!

661
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,009
I can do what i want!

662
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,886
No, you can't

663
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,181
This island belongs to us, the Shandians.

664
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:16,516
Huh? Really?

665
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:18,435
I thought it was God's.

666
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:19,811
I see.

667
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,813
Then, sorry for intruding.

668
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,067
Third verse!

669
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:25,609
The islands in the east~

670
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:26,985
Hold it !
The islands in the east~

671
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:27,903
What?

672
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,115
No, i have nothing to say.

673
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:37,663
And i don't feel like listening to your idiotic prattle.

674
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,166
I'm going to eliminate you!

675
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,043
What?

676
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,468
If that's all, you should've said so.

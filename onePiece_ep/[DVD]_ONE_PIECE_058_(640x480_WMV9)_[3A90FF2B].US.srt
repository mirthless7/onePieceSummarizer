1
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:31,580
Duel in the ruins!

2
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:31,580
Zoro Vs Erik!

3
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,260
It is cool Nami! Come to see that!

4
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,400
The pirate boat.

5
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,000
He, I see an island under this light!

6
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,390
We must direct the boat over there.

7
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,760
Why didn't you say me that you had found Sennenryu?

8
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,290
That the principal fleet puts the course on the Gunkan island.

9
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,200
How all the vessels install!

10
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,930
That arranges Nami well,
they is the guys who make all the job!

11
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,530
He you! Push a little more!

12
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,610
Stop of you foutre us, species of…

13
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,860
One finally arrived!

14
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,590
One is always alive?

15
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,470
Ouais, one would say well.

16
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,680
It is what… that?

17
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,310
What… is it?

18
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,500
Wahou! What a large hut!

19
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,960
It is what this drawing?

20
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,940
A plan would be said.

21
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,810
Ouais but one cannot read any more what is drawn with this crumbling.

22
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,780
Where are we thus?
One should not be in the nest of the dragons?

23
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,650
I do not know.
You think what of it, Apis?

24
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,430
I do not know. Ryuji says that it does not know either.

25
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,590
Good blood! It always arrives to us of arrange!

26
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,510
How that?

27
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,340
What… it is true!

28
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,840
And one should have done what for you then?

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,760
For me?

30
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,580
He, look at that the guy!

31
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,630
A piece of the ceiling fell here.

32
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,100
It is immense!

33
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,800
He, pay to…

34
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,310
This place is ready to crumble!

35
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,910
If one does not hurry one all will be in danger.

36
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,970
Let us drive the camp from here as fast as possible.

37
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,250
But, it is perhaps here the nest of the dragons!

38
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,520
Ah really, y' however does not have dragons at the horizon!

39
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,570
Wait one minute…

40
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,770
What is there, Nami-San?

41
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,680
This… is perhaps not Lost Island.

42
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,000
You see?

43
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,310
Do not make your malignant whereas you do not even know why!

44
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,770
How you know it Nami?

45
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,020
Look at the ceiling.

46
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,640
Drawings of the ceiling?

47
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,730
Look at attentively.

48
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,230
It is a plan which shows the direction of Lost Island.

49
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,150
This island where there is a building with a cupola…

50
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,360
It is the island where one is.

51
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,920
And this building it is this dome.

52
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,060
That resembles it bloody.

53
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,500
And people around the island

54
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,100
must be the inhabitants of the island it is very a long time.

55
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,540
Perhaps well ancestors of Apis.

56
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,130
My ancestors?

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,300
You remember of what Pépé Bokuden said?

58
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,730
Not. I slept.

59
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,220
He said that the inhabitants of the Gunkan island
came from another island, that returns to you?

60
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,620
Good Ah?

61
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,610
Ah, now that I ouais think of it,
he said a trick like that.

62
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,320
Then the royal dynasty about which he did speak found on this island?

63
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,570
Surely.

64
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,690
Statues and paintings of dragons were seen
when we arrived here.

65
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:51,660
I think that the inhabitants of the island considered
Sennenryu like Gods.

66
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,080
A long ago,
Sennenryu flew probably here.

67
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,340
Really?

68
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,340
Thus y' has little chance that the nest of dragons is here.

69
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,320
But… then where is it?

70
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,880
Perhaps that it is this island with the drawing of a dragon.

71
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,310
Exactly!

72
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,550
There is an island drawn in front of the people who request, not truth?

73
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,430
It is probably true Lost Island.

74
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,710
Thus the nest of the dragons would be certainly over there.

75
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,910
But…

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,940
Wait one second! This drawn island it is…

77
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,860
Yes… If one looks at his position on the plan,

78
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,980
the nest of the dragons must be on the Gunkan island.

79
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,580
Wait.

80
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,780
You said that there was no nest of dragons on the Gunkan island!

81
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,630
But it is however what this plan says!

82
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,730
You think that the old ones drew that without reason?

83
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,550
It rightly, load of cretins!
It is impossible that Nami-San is wrong!

84
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,360
That means that it is some share on this island.

85
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,210
One will be sure once over there.

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,210
But…

87
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,480
I have the presentiment which it was absorbed under the sea.

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,530
It is certainly what occurred.

89
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,760
That would explain why nobody still found it.

90
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,490
Apis?

91
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,770
Ryuji!

92
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,700
Remember, Ryuji!

93
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,670
Where is the nest of the dragons?

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,160
We thought of having found it but there is nothing here,

95
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,210
besides these frescos. Ryuji!

96
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,010
Look at these drawings!
Does that point out something to you?

97
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,090
We do not have any precise place where to go unless you do not remember it!

98
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,350
Please! Remember the place, Ryuji!

99
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,510
Ryuji!

100
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,290
Ok! I believe well that the nest of the dragons
is on the Gunkan island.

101
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,700
How do you know it, Luffy?

102
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,100
Like that…

103
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,390
You are right.
Ryuji remembers it now.

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,710
In the East of the top, in a place resembling a combat ship the nest of the dragons is.

105
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,400
Good blood!

106
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,840
One arrived here despite everything the dangers and here what arrives.

107
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,760
Afflicted…

108
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:27,150
I knew that their nest could be absorbed at sea, and I all took on board you here to find it.

109
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,020
It was wasted time.

110
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,560
Let us go, there is still hope.

111
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,650
Who knows, the nest of the dragons is perhaps in an unexplored place!

112
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,580
But one cannot the knowledge without have sought it!

113
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,670
It is true!

114
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,170
It is not your style to be a defaitist, Apis.

115
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,420
If you are afraid to make errors,
you will not arrive at nothing in the life.

116
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,460
The ways which one crosses are not all bad.

117
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,890
Friends…

118
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,390
On the way! Ryuji will not be able to recover
if we remain here, not truth?

119
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,290
Thank you!

120
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,460
There is a problem, Zoro?

121
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,500
Somebody us épie.

122
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,990
He is up there.

123
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,840
Thousand mercies for the explanations,
now I know where is

124
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,210
the nest of the dragons.

125
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,200
It is still you?

126
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,060
But it would be a great loss if it were under the sea.

127
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,170
Then I will take Sennenryu with me.

128
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,270
Not question!

129
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,130
We do not know yet if the nest of the dragons is under the ocean!

130
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,010
He said that he had the capacities of the fruit Kama Kama.

131
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,790
Why does one discuss with a similar zigoto?

132
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,210
The fruit Kama Kama?

133
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,330
He ate a Fruit of the Demon?

134
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,250
Luffy?

135
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,470
Take Ryuji and brings it on the boat.

136
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,470
I would join you later.

137
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,670
Included/understood!

138
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,200
Euh… on the boat?

139
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,280
I do not see an exit.

140
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,850
Then… One makes a news of it.

141
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,750
Not possible…

142
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,390
I was persuaded that I could pulverize it.

143
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,800
And here is the exit! It is impec now!
On the way, Apis!

144
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,720
It is as terrifying as a cave man.

145
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,730
Out of the question.

146
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,690
Luffy! Cretin!

147
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,690
Release from here before it is too late!

148
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,710
Sorry Oh.

149
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,870
Wahoo! It is coool!!

150
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,450
It is incredible how one always sometimes happens to leave oneself there.

151
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,490
One is not yet drawn from business, cretin!

152
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,380
It is too easy!

153
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,150
Cretin, you will regret it being to you put on my road!

154
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,040
One will see well who will regret it.

155
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,680
I became the fastest man of the world!

156
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,870
It is judicious to impress which?

157
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Luffy! Do something!

158
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,570
One will be disintegrated before to have reached the boat!

159
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,300
Worry you! Worry you!

160
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,170
How that?

161
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,130
It was what this trick?

162
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,180
I break, cretin.

163
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,550
I do not have time to lose with you.

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,240
My only objective is to recover Sennenryu!

165
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,470
Wait!

166
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,710
I hope that they of it are drawn.

167
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,310
He! You believe that Zoro is well?

168
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,050
Hein? Of course!

169
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,650
But this guy ate a Fruit of the Demon!

170
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,830
He will not be able to gain also extremely is he!

171
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,160
Even with that, all will go well!

172
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,750
Luffy! Right in front! Right in front!

173
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,710
Oh it is not good that.

174
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,270
That I know it well!

175
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,070
Do something!

176
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,960
They are over there.

177
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,990
Afflicted, I cannot let you pass.

178
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,000
It is what you believe?
It is me which decides if I pass or not.

179
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,570
Out of my sight!

180
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,310
Bastard, it is not that which will stop me!

181
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,610
I had said it to you that I would not let myself pass.

182
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,240
Not a gesture!

183
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,280
Luffy… There is still another dead end in front!

184
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,820
It will be exploded!

185
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,100
It is impossible!

186
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,340
It is the cliff on which we are ridden.

187
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,820
If you do that, one will fall over edge

188
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,470
and one all will die!

189
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,490
One can perhaps fly over it?

190
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,710
One cannot fly!!

191
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,480
I believed to have said to you to remain out of my way.

192
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,940
Now die like a good sort!

193
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,580
I believe that one will leave oneself there.

194
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,320
Really? I must say that considering the chance that one types oneself today…

195
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,020
One arrived.

196
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,240
You prepare, one from goes away!

197
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,520
I can about it more.

198
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,890
Draft!

199
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,340
I will kill it!

200
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,280
Luffy!

201
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,140
Zoro! He says that Zoro is in danger!

202
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,320
What will one make?
We must help it!

203
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,280
Die!

204
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:23,490
Zoro!

205
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,510
Bingo!

206
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,760
Incredible!

207
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,800
Luffy… I hallucinate…

208
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,800
By here!

209
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,240
I do not may find it beneficial to run up against the boat!!!

210
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,040
Ah, sorry.

211
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,560
One from these four, I really will kill you.

212
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,710
Shit.

213
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,700
I cannot let them leave!

214
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,240
Oh… One is outside! Outside!

215
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,160
That makes me very odd…

216
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,330
What? It is them?

217
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,020
Chief, they have Sennenryu and they put the course on the Gunkan island.

218
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,990
That one goes back to their continuation, immediately!

219
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,750
Yes!

220
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,310
Still a thing, Major! Erik-San returned too
and it goes up in this moment on the boat.

221
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,850
What a band of goods to nothing!

222
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,880
They could have run its boat…

223
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,340
It is nothing! Excel report/ratio!

224
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,710
I see that you are healthy and except.

225
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,130
Did you find these Ryukotsu which you seek?

226
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,630
Instead of blaguer,
leave to their continuation!

227
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,380
They try to catch up with us!

228
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,570
But they will never have us!

229
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,140
Compared with the famous navires de guerre of the Navy,

230
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,080
the Vogue-Merry can sail more quickly, but…

231
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,900
What will one make arrived at the Gunkan island once?

232
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,110
Worry you!

233
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,270
How that?

234
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,190
As long as one finds the nest of the dragons in first… And what one gives Ryuji on foot, it is essence, not?

235
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,270
It will not be so easy.

236
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,090
The island must be absorbed under the ocean.

237
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,360
Then one will seek under water!

238
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,510
You forgotten ace that you strokes like an anvil.

239
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,390
For all, it is necessary to leave from here as fast as possible!

240
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,640
We should not waste time with the Navy.

241
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,420
Nami-San!
I do not believe that it will be possible.

242
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,890
Cooool! It is terrible!

243
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,040
A floating waste-gas main would be said.

244
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,990
The small fish entered our nets!

245
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,600
How all the ships are put in range!

246
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,240
Akuyoku Formation!

247
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,890
How can they be so numerous?

248
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,330
Good blood how much ships they have in the Navy?

249
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,200
Take care that no fish escapes to us!

250
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,600
Connect together all the vessels with
chains to form an impenetrable wall!

251
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,340
What do they make?
One is taken with the trap!

252
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,650
One will board their ships,
their foutre a beating and to break these chains.

253
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,110
It is the only solution.

254
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,550
Super! You can really do that Usopp?

255
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,860
Ahead! Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

256
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,380
I suspected well….

257
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,060
It is not a so bad idea.

258
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,320
Be serious for you?

259
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,200
It does not matter the number of guy whom they have…

260
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,020
All will be well, Apis.
That passes or that breaks.

261
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,100
But made that quickly, Ok?

262
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,030
Let make us, Nami-San.

263
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,130
Ok! Ahead!

264
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,430
The objective of the fleet is to reach the pirate boat!

265
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,980
But do not touch with the raft behind them.

266
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,110
Only one scratch is not necessary!!

267
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,170
You stop!

268
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,650
How all the vessels stop!

269
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,100
Royal Nelson.

270
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,090
I believed that you think only of you empiffrer,

271
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,900
but on sea you are someone else.

272
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,920
A simple admiral but nevertheless an admiral.

273
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,240
It is really brilliant!

274
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,340
Well! Ahead!

1
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,600
Two blows per front and three by behind.

2
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,110
I do not know what it occurred in this room, but it is horrible.

3
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,089
Breaking news!

4
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,110
All fresh!

5
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,510
Anyone, I will never forgive him!

6
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,229
Get stuffed, Luffy with the Straw hat!

7
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,050
Is this your answer to have taken to you your 200 million?

8
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,450
Unforgivable!

9
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,799
Do not be timid, listen to all!?

10
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,330
Acclaim me!

11
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,519
Show yourself, Straw hat!

12
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:51,490
The man Gomu Gomu VS
The cyborg with the breath of fire

13
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,220
Show yourself, Straw hat!

14
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,599
You are inevitably in the corner, Luffy with the Straw hat!

15
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,019
What? This degenerate knows my name.

16
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,560
Haven't people not just called it “Franky”?

17
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,630
Then it is of its fault…

18
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,449
It is of its fault if Usopp is…

19
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,560
This money is with us maintaining.

20
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,279
RETURN the-ME!

21
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,090
It is…

22
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,900
Luffy.

23
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,619
Oi! The puppet in slipway!

24
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,990
He, Luffy.

25
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,520
Hein?

26
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,920
It is me, Luffy!

27
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,419
Still not of news?

28
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,480
How is it?

29
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,870
You all.

30
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,700
Kalifa.

31
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,530
Made not noise while entering.

32
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,380
Then…

33
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,090
Iceberg-san returned to him.

34
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,130
Brilliant!

35
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,770
They is marvellous!

36
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,450
Iceberg-san!

37
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,469
Maaa, sorry to have caused you concern.

38
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,709
It does not matter, they are good to re-examine you alive.

39
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,870
You rest a little.

40
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,910
One deals with the building site while waiting.

41
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,550
In connection with…

42
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,570
Those which returned in my room…

43
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,159
The investigation is in hand.

44
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,100
Not, I remember.

45
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,399
They were two.

46
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
A giant with a mask, and the other…

47
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,090
Was a woman with the long brown hair.

48
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,690
No doubts…

49
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,650
This glance sinks…

50
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,220
Begun again knowledge

51
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,810
Iceberg-san…

52
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,589
Iceberg-san regained consciousness!

53
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,409
Really?!

54
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,169
Thank you my God!

55
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,269
Brilliant!

56
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,270
Youpi!

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,010
Es you Luffy with the Straw hat?

58
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,689
You did not go there with hand died during my absence, small.

59
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,309
I did not believe my eyes of them while returning.

60
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,319
My house was not any more in the same state as with my departure.

61
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,820
And you put my men in a sorry state.

62
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,330
Pay to.

63
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,409
I am unchained this week!

64
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,059
And a thing is sure…

65
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,669
This anger will not be calmed as much as I will not have reduced to you in dust!

66
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,910
He!

67
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,509
, Where is to you our money? The 200 million berrys.

68
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,120
Return it to us!

69
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,600
Hein? The 200 million berrys?

70
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,370
I very spent, I am dry.

71
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,429
Do not make any you for the dough…

72
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,429
Since it was dirty money, pirate!

73
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,830
Nothing with foutre!

74
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,139
It is about OUR money!

75
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,610
In any event, I will not be able to calm myself…

76
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,960
As long as I will not have you boot the bottom!

77
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,219
It is me which will not calm me, merdeux!

78
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,870
Oi! Go down immediately!

79
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,349
It is foutu, Franky will break out!

80
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,639
With the shelter! All with the shelter!

81
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,010
Flee!

82
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,850
What it fout?

83
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,039
It spits of fire!

84
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,250
How it does that?

85
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,880
You ace never considering a guy to spit of fire?

86
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,230
Perhaps it has the capacities of a fruit?

87
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,840
Which fruit?

88
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,479
What?! This dumb jumped to water!

89
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,800
He is stupid?!

90
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,919
If it has the capacities of a fruit of the demon, it will drown.

91
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,669
It had to slip.

92
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,850
It has the capacities of a fruit which makes spit fire.

93
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,579
It is which this guy?!

94
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,390
He can swim?!

95
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,580
I did not eat any fruit of the demon!

96
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,410
GOMU GOMU NO…

97
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,270
I heard of tone capacity.

98
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,420
STRONG RIGHT!

99
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,140
What?

100
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,950
Luffy!

101
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,889
Luffy!

102
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,240
Luffy!

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,340
What? It was what that?

104
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,340
You do not know?

105
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,840
Then I will explain you…

106
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,310
I am a man-robot…

107
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,850
A cyborg.

108
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,520
The crew of Straw hat?

109
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,189
It is true?

110
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,179
Yes.

111
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,010
I carried out my survey.

112
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,059
I asked Lucci confirmation near the government.

113
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,210
Then…

114
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,089
Ouais, when I contacted the government…

115
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,450
They affirmed me that it belonged to the crew of Straw hat.

116
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,800
They are thus them them guilty…

117
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,740
The crew of Straw hat.

118
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:09,089
Why? By vengance that one doesnot can repair their boat?!

119
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,900
Nobody knows.

120
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,619
It does not matter the reason, one is sure that it is them.

121
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,999
We will be able to ask them after having caught them.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,880
I wonder which excuse they we will give…

123
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,850
One will return to you what you merits, Straw hat!

124
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,450
Continue to seek Robin-chan, Chopper.

125
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,830
Sanji, say to me…

126
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,600
Aqua Laguna must be terrifying.

127
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,509
Yes, all the city will be submerged.

128
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,269
I know somebody who is perhaps not with the current which the high tide arrives.

129
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,339
Perhaps…

130
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,590
Then, of the horrible things could arrive at its boat.

131
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,770
Not, then…

132
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,499
He Sanji…

133
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,520
Chopper.

134
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,350
With the fact, didn't you say to have forgotten something on Merry?

135
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,130
Not?

136
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,030
Then it is foutu.

137
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,320
Await us! One returns to seek you!

138
00:12:48,090 --> 00:13:02,480
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

139
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,069
OOOIIII!! It IS HORRIBLE!!

140
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,619
YOU DO TOO MUCH NOISE, TILESTON!

141
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,930
Bandage insolents! Remain quiet please!

142
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,150
ICEBERG-SAN! GOD THANK YOU, YOU ARE AWAKED!

143
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,420
You do too much noise.

144
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,570
You do nothing but worsen his state.

145
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,050
It IS TRUE!! I AM SORRY!!

146
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,089
I HAD FORGOTTEN! It IS HORRIBLE! LISTEN TO me!

147
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,970
Do not return. Tell here.

148
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,049
The PIRATE WITH the STRAW HAT SE BEATS WITH FRANKY WITH the N°1 DOCK!!

149
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,900
It IS the BROTHEL WITH the BUILDING SITE!

150
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,030
Straw hat…

151
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,020
Iceberg-san!

152
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,780
It has base to be shown over there.

153
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,270
You, Iceberg-san rest.

154
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,050
I remain near you.

155
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,360
GUN!

156
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,009
Made blunder! Ca collapses!

157
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,970
The boat will fall in ruins!

158
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,640
Stop! Why you made that?!

159
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,130
Luffy! Boot me the bottom of this puppet in slipway!

160
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,609
Aniki!

161
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,100
You beat!

162
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,640
No matter what it arrives…

163
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,200
I will botterai you the bottom!

164
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,250
Test! Your attacks do not have any effect on me!

165
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,430
WEAPONS LEFT!

166
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,659
GOMU GOMU NO…

167
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,060
MUCHI!

168
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,240
What?! What did it occur?

169
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,310
Ah, it is…

170
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,680
It is which?

171
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,069
It is what this behavior?

172
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,850
What tests you to make, Straw hat?

173
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,570
Do Galley it, what you foutez there?

174
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,390
Engineers of the Dock n°1!

175
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,699
Youpi! The engineers finally arrived!

176
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,180
It was time, a little more and the building site was in ruin.

177
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,399
Brilliant, they are the carpenters of yesterday.

178
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,370
They are on our side.

179
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,899
Oh oh! The small ones of Galley it!

180
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,319
It is not well to mix with the businesses of the others!

181
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,179
You are likely to hurt you!

182
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,579
How oses you to speak to us on this tone?

183
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,059
When our building site is damaged like that…

184
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,540
One is obliged to intervene.

185
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,659
OUAIS, FRANKY!

186
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,919
HOW HOPE YOU TO PAY FOR ALL THAT??!

187
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,060
Wait, Tileston.

188
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,390
One will see that later.

189
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,780
For the moment, there are more important things.

190
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,910
He, Luffy with the straw hat.

191
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,199
You us, isn't this remembers?

192
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,300
How oses you still to show you here?

193
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,510
What? One learned the news for Ossan and…

194
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,369
Doesn't my house have is enough to you, you also muddled itself with Galley it?

195
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,999
In full crisis of adolescence to muddle you with all people that you are to you meetings?!

196
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,670
I SAY to YOU THAT I MADE AI NOTHING!

197
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,219
You can play the innocent one as much as you will want!

198
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,120
ROTATION HALF KNOT

199
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,270
Ca hurts!

200
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,720
Badly…

201
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,980
AIR DRIVE

202
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,039
SPECIES Of DUMBS!

203
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,919
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO INTERFERE YOU THAT?!

204
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,580
It IS ME WHICH MUST REGULATE ITS ACCOUNT to HIM!

205
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,069
Show them, Galley it Company!

206
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,190
Five stronger from the docks go battrent themselves!

207
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,389
He?! Why the carpenters are our enemies?

208
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,280
Oh! Oh!

209
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,099
Oi, wait!

210
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,480
I do not have any reason to fight against you!

211
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,570
This guy…

212
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,450
With capacities.

213
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,610
He, guy! You does listenings not when one speak to you?

214
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,310
I said…

215
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,030
He is with me!

216
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,809
There are not time to lose with you, Franky!

217
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,690
What, it is what this species of monkey?!

218
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,860
YOU DISTURB US, FRANKY!

219
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,489
Tileston is too strong!

220
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,460
It is the montrueuse force of Tileston!

221
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,330
Stop!

222
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,049
They are really strong.

223
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,909
Shit.

224
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,520
You made what? Say to me at least why!

225
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,270
Straw hat, it is we who would like to know.

226
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,640
The criminals who entered the office and who attacked Iceberg-san…

227
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,710
It was you, hein?

228
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,510
Never!

229
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,909
Such a thing…

230
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,000
These guys interfere in my combat…

231
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,460
This person, it was Nico Robin.

232
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,940
Was the giant one of them?

233
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,470
Initially, why would they have attacked me?

234
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,400
I cannot believe that it is by vangeance.

235
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,870
They are probably in the search of this thing which I hold.

236
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,480
Would there be a bond between the government and these pirates?

237
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,600
Or do they seek it for them-even?

238
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,390
Straw hat…

239
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,040
Scoop… The last scoop!

240
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,620
The name of the culprit appears in the deposition of Iceberg-san!

241
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,689
Really?!

242
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,559
We must inform the city and put them of it out of state to harm!

243
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,229
Do not let them escape from Toilets 7!

244
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,310
Catch the culprits!

245
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,050
The persons in charge of the aggression of Iceberg-san are…

246
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,100
Pirates of Straw hat.

1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

3
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
If it's your wish, you can just

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Say a spell in your chest

6
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
For your hopes...

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Our quick premonition

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Won't you come with me?

10
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
We're fallen angels,

11
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

12
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
What color shall we add

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,440
Into the cobalt blue?

14
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

15
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,750
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

16
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Surreal fallen angels,

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Singing from our hearts.

18
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
Kobaruto buruu ni ukabeta kumo ga

19
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Michi ni mayotta asu o nurashita

20
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
Tasogare no mae ni waraeba ii dake sa

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
Negai nara chiisana mune no naka

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Kibou de jumon o

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
Kakereba...

24
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Kasoku shita yokan

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Nanairo no onpukana de

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Issho ni konai ka?

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
Bokura datenshi

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
Yume ni ya o hanatsu no sa

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560

Hitomi ni utsutta kanashii riaru o kowase

Nukumori tsuki no hane o ageyou

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Shuuru na datenshi

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Kokoro kara utau no sa

35
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,610
Wealth.

36
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,920
Fame.

37
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,580
Power.

38
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,410
The man who once owned everything,

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,760
The Pirate King,

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,830
Gold Roger.

41
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,050
The words he said before his death

42
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,040
sent all the people of the world

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,750
out to the seas.

44
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,720
My treasure?

45
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,250
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

46
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,490
Find it!

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,600
I left everything in that place.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,650
Men, searching for romance,

49
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,400
pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,280
The world is now

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,090
in the Grand Age of Pirates!

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,390
H-he broke out of Kami-Shibari?

53
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,380
Kami-Shibari: Hair-bind

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,350
Rumble

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,710
I'm sorry, Doctorine...

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,300
Just like Doctor gave his life to save the country...

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,190
I'll risk my life to save my nakama.

58
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,320
If I'm gonna die anyway...

59
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,910
Then I'll do it!

60
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,950
But please...

61
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,120
Nobody come into this room!

62
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,760
Kalifa the Bubble User!

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,340
The Soap Trap Approaches Nami

64
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,710
I don't know what's going on...

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,350
But he's just like a devil!

66
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,620
I think I've grown to like you!

67
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,940
I don't know if you're a devil or a demon,

68
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,940
But either way, you're following the path of a man!

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:59,350
In the name of Kumadori the Lion, I will attempt to defeat you!

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,240
Soru!

71
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,210
Soru: Shave

72
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,400
Shigan Q! Q! Q! Q!

73
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,370
Shigan: Finger gun

74
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,680
Geppou!

75
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,680
Geppou: Moon walk

76
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,380
Shishi Kababu!

77
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,380
Shishi Kababu: Lion birch-turnip, as well as a pun with "shish kebab"

78
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,730
If it keeps going like this, then I'll...

79
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,270
Take this!

80
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,410
Sei Mei Ki Kan!

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,410
Sei mei ki kan: Life return

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,010
Kami-Shibari!

83
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,030
Kami-Shibari!

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,590
Ka... Kami-Shibari!

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,110
How can this be...

86
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm frozen up all the way to the ends of my hair!

87
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,920
My conciousness is...

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,370
It seems like I may have to run away...

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,720
You're very annoying!

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,530
I'm going to stop him now, Mother!

91
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,530
To a man...

92
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,650
To a man...

93
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,410
To a man...!

94
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,660
There are sometimes that battles need to be fought!

95
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,070
Soru!

96
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,110
Rankyaku "Renge"!

97
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,050
Rankyaku "Renge": Storm leg "lotus blossom"

98
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,040
Take this!

99
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,250
Yana Gin Jou!

100
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,210
Yana Gin Jou: Emotional song of the willows

101
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,630
Shit...

102
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,900
Even this week's "Super Me"...

103
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,160
Had more trouble than I'd imagined...

104
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,750
But...

105
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,920
I got the key.

106
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,980
Number four, huh?

107
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,650
The one the swordsman and long-nose wanted was number two, right?

108
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,800
So if this guy had four, and that guy had three...

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,900
There's only one person left.

110
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,950
Then that means the number two key is held by that secretary woman!

111
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,340
I should hurry...

112
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,570
I need to go help!

113
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,380
Weren't you short on time?

114
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,770
I thought you said you wouldn't go easy on me...

115
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,370
Perhaps I misheard you?

116
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,330
Making fun of me...

117
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,460
You'll pay for this!

118
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,500
Well then, attack me.

119
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,950
You don't have to wait.

120
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,780
The fight has already begun.

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,370
A devil fruit user, taking a bath right in front of their enemy...

122
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,260
If at least half your body submerged, you should lose your power!

123
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,430
Are you trying to say I'm letting my guard down?

124
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,530
Don't worry.

125
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,450
You did lose your power as well.

126
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,110
Excuse me a moment.

127
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,910
What did you do to me?

128
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,150
Isn't unraveling that mystery...

129
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,730
...the best part of fighting a devil fruit user?

130
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,500
The one who did that to Sanji-kun has to be this woman...

131
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
I have to be careful!

132
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,080
Otherwise, there'll be no purpose to me taking his place!

133
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,050
My strength's coming back a little.

134
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,890
I'll show you...

135
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,780
The power of the Perfect Clima Tact!

136
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,990
If you think I'm just a cute face, you're sadly mistaken!

137
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,820
I can move my legs...

138
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,950
Here I go...

139
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,620
Thunder Charge!

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,450
Swing Arm!

141
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,490
What a great weapon.

142
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,210
This is...

143
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,720
A cloud?

144
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,510
I'm not just gonna sit and let you beat me.

145
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,810
Thunderbolt...

146
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,820
Tempo!

147
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,770
You gave me too much time, so that's what happens.

148
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,620
You surprised me.

149
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,830
I never thought I would be struck by lightning while indoors.

150
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,320
What? The form she had when guarding against the lightning...

151
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
It disappeared into bubbles!

152
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,250
If you can't solve that mystery, you have no hope of winning.

153
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,960
Are you able to do that?

154
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,350
It really is soap turning into bubbles...

155
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,610
You're a soap-human who ate the awa-awa no mi,

156
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,340
or something like that?

157
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,310
Awa-Awa no mi: Bubble-Bubble fruit

158
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,960
B-but, even if you know what my power is,

159
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,940
You still don't have a chance of winning!

160
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,810
Insolent girl!

161
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,610
Looks like I was right... Is that bad?

162
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,540
That's right. Cleanliness is power...

163
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,240
I ate the Awa-Awa no mi,

164
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,280
I am a soap-human who can create bubbles.

165
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,210
Isn't it wonderful?

166
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,380
Wow, she's so sexy!

167
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,480
If I had a secretary like this, I'd be so happy...

168
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
No, I'm not an old pervert!

169
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,910
But isn't that useless in battle?

170
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,010
It doesn't seem too powerful.

171
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,060
But all of the bubbles that my body creates,

172
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,260
I am able to manipulate to my liking.

173
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,720
What?

174
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,130
I'll show you.

175
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,450
The bubbles from the bathtub?

176
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,500
Bubble Master!

177
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,010
Soap Sheep!

178
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,000
This...

179
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,360
Well, isn't it wonderful?

180
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,720
Are you an idiot?

181
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,670
Appearances can be deceiving.

182
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,910
Hitsuji-Gumo Relax Awa!

183
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,880
Hitsuji-Gumo Relax Awa: Sheep-cloud relax bubbles, as well as "awa" being a pun with "hour"

184
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,870
Do you happen to know why you lost your strength upon entering this room?

185
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,980
That's right...

186
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,490
That had to be part of this woman's power as well.

187
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,430
Bubbles!

188
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,790
That's right, when I first stepped into the room...

189
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,250
The floor was covered in bubbles.

190
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,770
No!

191
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,870
You figured it out too late.

192
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,830
I'm losing my strength...

193
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,960
Before...

194
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,350
It was from when I stepped on the bubbles when I first came in...

195
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,560
You'll understand the terror of my power little by little...

196
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,850
The bubbles my body produces can weaken any object.

197
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,560
Not only can they clean off dirt, they can also clean off power and other things.

198
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,760
And the one thing you should never forget,

199
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,750
is that I am an assassin.

200
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,890
I can move...

201
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,810
All the bubbles from before are gone.

202
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,230
I won't let you do any more...

203
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,950
Thunder Ball!

204
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,970
That weapon...

205
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,050
Is all that I don't quite understand.

206
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,220
I'm losing my strength...

207
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,600
Before...

208
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,710
It was from when I stepped on the bubbles when I first came in...

209
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,550
You'll understand the terror of my power little by little...

210
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,240
The bubbles my body produces can weaken any object.

211
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,230
Not only can they clean off dirt, they can also clean off power and other things.

212
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,430
And the one thing you should never forget,

213
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,170
is that I am an assassin.

214
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,310
I can move...

215
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,260
All the bubbles from before are gone.

216
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,490
I won't let you do any more...

217
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,350
Thunder Ball!

218
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,330
That weapon...

219
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,630
Is all that I don't quite understand.

220
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,030
Golden Awa!

221
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,030
Golden Awa: Golden bubble, "awa" is also a pun with "hour"

222
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,990
What are you doing?!

223
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,580
I can't stand up...

224
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,500
W-what happened to my legs?

225
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,960
Aren't they pretty?

226
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,110
Anything I touch can gain a beautiful shine.

227
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,060
I'll give you beautiful skin...

228
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,760
All over your entire body.

229
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,070
Tekkai!

230
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,070
Tekkai: Iron mass

231
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,290
I still don't know what's going on.

232
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,960
So I'll go get some more cola.

233
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,660
Maybe I can see how that deer's doing...

234
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,720
What's that?

235
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,380
What... is this?

236
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,580
That's the CP9 that was in the fridge...

237
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,910
What? This monster beat him?

238
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,650
What's going on?

239
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,070
Wasn't that deer wearing that same hat?

240
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,040
Oi, you!

241
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Aren't you that deer-gorilla?

242
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,260
Oi... this is a joke, right?

243
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,020
There's no mistaking it...

244
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Kumadori-san!

245
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,240
He came flying from the Tower of Justice!

246
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,090
But that's... Who could have done that?!

247
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,670
Damn...

248
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,120
What the hell's up with him?

249
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,160
A voice.

250
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,540
Oi, hurry up...

251
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,900
Why're you stopping, Nico Robin?!

252
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,980
Oi, did you hear me?!

253
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,200
You woman who's mere existence is a crime!

254
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,940
Oi, Lucci, drag her along!

255
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,910
Grab her by the hair!

256
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,280
It's an order.

257
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,850
Keep moving.

258
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,080
Nico Robin.

259
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,820
Wait...

260
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,310
Do you actually still think the Strawhat crew's gonna come to save you?

261
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,760
Idiot!

262
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,070
Do you really believe in those lousy pirates?

263
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,020
That explosion earlier had to be my imagination.

264
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,190
There's no way they could make it here!

265
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:12,030
While they're still dreaming about saving you, we'll go through the Gate of Justice!

266
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,050
The Bridge of Hesitation reaches to the true Gate of Justice.

267
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,860
We'll go across the half of the bridge that's prepared.

268
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,150
Once the gate is opened, we'll raise the other half of the bridge.

269
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,880
And then we'll make it through the Gate of Justice!

270
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,460
And last, we'll close the gate again.

271
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:36,670
You'll never feel hope again.

272
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,220
Never again.

273
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:44,020
The only thing you'll ever feel will be the pain of your sins.

274
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,480
You'll continue to pay for the sin of living until this day!

275
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,840
Right, Nico Robin?

276
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,630
Well, let's hurry.

277
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,630
Hurry up and come!

278
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,560
ROBIN!

279
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,910
W-what was that?!

280
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,100
I heard a voice!

281
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,830
What was that voice?!

282
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,550
Director, you take Nico Robin, and please, hurry on ahead.

283
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,250
A door?

284
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,840
Looks like this one isn't made of steel...

285
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,440
It got really wide! Where am I?

286
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,740
I found you, pigeon-guy!

287
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,640
You finally made it.

288
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,590
Oi, answer me, CP9!

289
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,010
A pirate managed to get down here!

290
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,830
Damn... are you guys even listening?!

291
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,840
Wait! You... that's...!

292
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,370
I pushed the Golden Den-Den Mushi!

293
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,860
Next time on One Piece:

294
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,290
Resounding Bad News!

295
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,110
The Buster Call Invoked!

296
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,370
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

1
00:02:51,660 --> 00:03:00,580
Crocodile of Sands VS Aqua-Luffy!

2
00:02:51,660 --> 00:03:00,580
Fights in Mort, Round 2

3
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,780
You cannot save this country.

4
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,760
Good voyage, Princess.

5
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,060
Crocodile!!

6
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,880
Luffy-San!!

7
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,730
Straw hat!

8
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,170
Luffy is alive!

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,470
I will finish this combat.

10
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,600
Once and for all!

11
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,720
When are wet to you, you cannot change into sand.

12
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,400
You ace fear of water.

13
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,230
It is for that you stolen ace the rain.

14
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,950
Now, I will burst you!

15
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,410
We beat!

16
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,290
Rise!

17
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,570
Crocodile!

18
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,670
Go, upright! Vermin!

19
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,900
What do you say?

20
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,550
Will a bomb explode in 10 minutes?

21
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,610
Yes! With 16:30 precisely!

22
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,770
16:30?

23
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,280
If this bomb explodes, it will destroy all in a radius of 5 kms!

24
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,790
It is what Crocodile said!

25
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,980
A radius of 5 kms! Ca wants to say…!

26
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,350
… how the rebellious army and the royal army will be both destroyed!

27
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,510
This dirty Croco of shit…

28
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,970
Q- What do we have to make?

29
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,150
It is necessary to find the bomb planters!

30
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,070
And to stop them!

31
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,620
Bomb planters?

32
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,500
How to find them?

33
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,780
In only 10 minutes?

34
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,380
There are not time to think of that!

35
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,500
But, listen, if the ray of destruction is of 5 kms,

36
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,780
they must be distant from at least 2,5 kms, not?

37
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,250
Not, I do not believe!

38
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,310
They are probably very close to the place!

39
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,900
Q- What?

40
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,070
If they are here, they will jump with the others!

41
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,960
It is well the kind of Crocodile.

42
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,800
To sacrifice its own men?

43
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,130
What a salts bastard!

44
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,160
One would make better hurry!

45
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,830
You were found, Princesse Vivi!

46
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,190
Your death will save to us a large promotion!

47
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,280
Billions!

48
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,020
Less than ten minutes…

49
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,000
...com well of seconds for these?

50
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,820
Hey, hey! Not enough to have even time to discuss it!

51
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,560
2 seconds!

52
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,510
One leaves in front!

53
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,950
One leaves in front!

54
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,320
Go ahead!

55
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,350
Deviated from my way, cretin!

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Exactly what I was going to say!

57
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,290
One separates!

58
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,580
It is necessary to leave this whore of sand cloud!

59
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,970
Only 10 minutes!

60
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,140
Well! Quickly, it is necessary to go there!

61
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,720
Ouais!

62
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,390
It is really… the ultimate limit of time!

63
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,890
The destiny of this country…

64
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,610
… will be sealed…

65
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,930
… in 10 minutes!

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,090
You think of being able to beat me?

67
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,180
Ouep, you can change more into sand.

68
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,940
I am impressed enough that included/understood you that with the threshold of death.

69
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,690
But there is still a basic difference which you will not be able to overcome.

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,270
It is the level of Shichibukai.

71
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,710
And then, that done no matter what you would be one of Shichibukai?

72
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,340
I will become…

73
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,540
Shichi = 7 Hachi = 8

74
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,540
… Hachibukai!

75
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,420
Who is this boy?

76
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,890
A pirate.

77
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,140
Perhaps that you are not with the current…

78
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,950
but it would seem that the Princess has escaped accuracy with death.

79
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,690
Then it is him which brought back Vivi here?

80
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,800
Ca is not used for nothing!
I do not have that to dodge your attack.

81
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,030
And even if you are covered with water,

82
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,930
my hand can always drain the water of your body!

83
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,050
M- Shit! It can still do that!

84
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,210
It who me it said ace, isn't this is you?

85
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,380
To succeed in having a perfect command of the capacities of the Fruit of the Demon…

86
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,290
… can make invincible.

87
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,350
… and…

88
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,250
Crafty person!

89
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,810
Still this attack?

90
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,340
It did not pass far…

91
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,400
You really think of gaining by always using the same technique?

92
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,160
Ouais!

93
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,670
And how!

94
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,290
I had envisaged that since the beginning!

95
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,990
I will cover you water!

96
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,660
Which foreseeable plan…

97
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,960
The barrel! The barrel!

98
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,210
How you have the pitiful air, Luffy with the straw hat!

99
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,790
You can nothing make without this barrel.

100
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,550
It would be said that nothing changed since our last combat!

101
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,740
It is right.

102
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,620
Up to now, nothing changed.

103
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,030
And now?

104
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,810
I am more same as front one!

105
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,910
Is it insane?

106
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,080
AQUA LUFFY!

107
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
Shit! An escape!

108
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,710
Is this kid… serious?

109
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,930
I feel…

110
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,090
I believe that one is not supposed water drinking as much.

111
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,210
Does it include/understand really the situation?

112
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,180
Stop your conneries, kid!

113
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,060
Not!

114
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,910
It is no matter what which call you “conneries”?

115
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,400
My body…!

116
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,780
I am always serious!

117
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,900
Then, it was how?

118
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,360
Croco of sands!

119
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,980
Incredible!

120
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,650
Wounded crocodile…

121
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,400
… by this boy?

122
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,860
It is not the moment to be filled with wonder, Mr. Cobra.

123
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,420
Now, you will lead me…

124
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,510
… at the place where Ponéglyphe is engraved.

125
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,980
Why do you need some?

126
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,260
Do not put stupid questions.

127
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,810
You have just with me to lead to it.

128
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,880
Your chance probably turned.

129
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,830
The countdown… is finished.

130
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,600
Release from there, Nico Robin.

131
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,720
Unless you do not want to also be drained.

132
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,470
I… lost any patience.

133
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,510
Nico Robin?

134
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,700
Well, as you want.

135
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,250
Listen well, Straw hat…

136
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,560
All the stones of the ground will be reduced in crumbs.

137
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
The grass is desiccated!

138
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,840
Q- Q Q What??

139
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,990
J- I fall…

140
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,310
I failed to make me have!

141
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,090
This bastard!

142
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,340
He aspired all water with his hand!

143
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,990
Do you think of being able to block my capacities, Aqua Luffy?

144
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,640
If it is the case, you are mistaken seriously.

145
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,620
The capacity of sand rests in its capacity to drain any thing.

146
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,820
Look at!

147
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,080
My right hand drains all that it touches.

148
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,910
Indefinitely…

149
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,040
Stone!

150
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Even the statues change into sand!

151
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,220
The ground… dies!

152
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,230
My sandals too!

153
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,450
All that touches this hand…

154
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,970
… dies!

155
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,040
Where are they?

156
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,650
And where they hide?

157
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,460
More that 8 minutes!

158
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,430
One can still find them in 8 minutes!

159
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,650
No matter what it arrives, it is necessary to prevent this bomb from exploding!

160
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,610
Without what, more than one million people will die!

161
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,710
A bomb with a ray of destruction of 5 kms!

162
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,230
One is not speaking about a small bomb of shit!

163
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,300
Would they be in it?

164
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,050
Shit!

165
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,020
Go! In 8 minutes, Alubarna will be nothing any more but one heap of ruins!

166
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,650
In 8 minutes, we all will be died!

167
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,850
There are not time to panic!

168
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,420
R- Look at!

169
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,540
Ca must be that!

170
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,220
There are only 8 minutes to find the way until up there!

171
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,880
He!

172
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,660
And shit!

173
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,720
Summers you… a rebel?

174
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,650
Pas le time for the courtesies.

175
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,550
Thus rest a little!

176
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,380
Ca is there! It is that!

177
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,010
Not! That one is very covered with foam!

178
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,720
No sign of them!

179
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,980
Where are they?

180
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,220
Nothing which resembles a gun!

181
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,800
Why?

182
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,430
Why?

183
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,860
More that 7 minutes!

184
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,780
I must stop it!

185
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,590
At all costs!

186
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,300
Nico Robin? Is this your true name there?

187
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,890
What can that make well?

188
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,400
I do not see in what that looks at you.

189
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,630
20 years ago, a young girl of this name became tristement célèbre in the whole world.

190
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,860
Why would it re-appear now?

191
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,150
The only thing that you have to make, it is me to lead to Ponéglyphe.

192
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,080
They to trail by here, isn't this is dangerous, Miss Navy?

193
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,460
Let pass to me.
I am in a hurry.

194
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,820
I will not authorize it!

195
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,530
A wounded soldier told me what occurred here, in Alubarna!

196
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,110
Do you know which is the person that you retain?

197
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,910
It does not matter which it is!

198
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,680
I hate any person related to the Government.

199
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,200
If you do not let to me pass…

200
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,030
I do not intend to let to you slip by!

201
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,170
In this case, I will have to kill you.

202
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,580
Wait, Marines!

203
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,880
It does not matter what arrives to me!

204
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,420
The place of the palate, where the rebellion burst…

205
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,250
… will be destroyed by an explosion with 16:30 exactly!

206
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,770
You must prevent it!

207
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,150
What!?

208
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
It is in 7 minutes!?

209
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,170
The lives of a million people are concerned!

210
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,160
But…?

211
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,310
In this case, we must help you and prevent the explosion!

212
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,290
Wait!

213
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,400
This woman is…!

214
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,790
IN POSITION!

215
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,330
Release from my way!

216
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,160
A special capacity!

217
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,150
I had specified that I was in a hurry.

218
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,810
Do not cause me longer!

219
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,360
Staff sergeant!

220
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,410
This woman, it is Nico Robin!

221
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,320
I am sure!

222
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,760
Colonel Smoker had ordered to me to find his sheet of research!

223
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,870
This woman….

224
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,350
That made 20 years that there is a beautiful reward on its head!

225
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,050
I remember even article of the newspaper.

226
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,420
The incident, during which six vessels of Marine combat were run,

227
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,000
… had been caused by a eight year old young girl!

228
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,180
The Government had declared it very high threat,

229
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,550
and a premium of 79.000.000 Berrys for its capture offered.

230
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,450
After that, it disappeared without leaving traces…

231
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,320
Stop your chatterings!

232
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,660
Will you let me pass?
Or do you want to die?

233
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,460
Which is your choice?

234
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,650
The advantage of the number is not of any utility against it…

235
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,190
Sergeant! Take along all the men on the place and find this bomb!

236
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,650
But, Staff sergeant!

237
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,790
Go!!! There remain only 6 minutes!

238
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,770
Yes!

239
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,130
Now, let leave it!

240
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,090
I said to you to release from my way!

241
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,750
It was right!

242
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,780
He did not joke with his right hand.

243
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,410
The garden changed into desert.

244
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,040
Where is party?

245
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,070
You too much much pushed me with end…

246
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,580
Failure.

247
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,710
Cro- Co…

248
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,160
Once again, you lost.

249
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,430
Luffy with the straw hat.

1
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Battle with the Giants! 
Open the Second Door!

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,970
One Piece Treasure Sweepstakes! The first letter is...

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,360
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,670
That's why you should wait here for five minutes and then bash into the Main Island with the Rocketman!

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:26,550
We'll go fight first and open a passage so that the train can pass between the Main Gate and the Main Island Gate.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,880
You Straw Hats should try to avoid unnecessary battles and concentrate on just following the CP9.

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,710
Yeah, I got it!

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,970
What the hell is he doing all by himself!?

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,350
That guy doesn't understand the plan at all!

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,530
Damn you pirate!

11
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,640
I'll hurry in first, so...

12
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,820
Let's meet again some other time!

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,680
See ya!

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,310
Don't let them open the gate!

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,640
Shit!

16
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,470
Scram! You're in the way!

17
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,390
Let's break through!

18
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,600
We breached the first one, the Main Gate!

19
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,860
Hey, Sogeking...

20
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,540
Hey!

21
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,590
That hurt, oi!

22
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,880
It's about how I make this cold air tact function, you see.

23
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,640
Let me see. Eh, don't ask me!

24
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,200
Everyone... I wonder if they're all okay.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,420
Sit quietly and wait, Chopper.

26
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,920
We've got enough to worry about with our captain.

27
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,750
I still haven't gotten enough sleep...

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,100
Let's take care of them quickly and get back to sleep.

29
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,320
Oimo!

30
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,030
G-Gi-Giants!

31
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,660
Oi! Straw Hat Luffy.

32
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,480
How many nakama did you bring with you?

33
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,390
Enies Lobby has over ten thousand soldiers!

34
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,580
Yeah. I'm alone.

35
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,440
Open the way!

36
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,650
We won't let you pass through this gate!

37
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,130
If you don't go back home obediently...

38
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,420
...we'll crush you down!

39
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,370
Don't be scared! Franky-aniki is just behind those doors!

40
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,560
Show them a fight that won't shame aniki's name! Franky Family!

41
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,400
Don't fail!

42
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,360
Let's clear the way for the Rocketman!

43
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,500
Force the gate open!

44
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,880
I won't let any of you pass through that gate!

45
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,630
The Destroyers!

46
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,220
Everybody!

47
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,340
Damn! How do they dare do that to our main forces?

48
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,090
Go!

49
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,680
What?

50
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,600
Zanbai!

51
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,800
Kiwi! Mozu!

52
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,990
Galley-La!

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,700
Sorry, we're late! It took longer than expected to get Sodome and Gomorrah on land!

54
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,130
Zanbai! The Destroyers were...

55
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,630
I understand.

56
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,910
We don't have the time to treat them!

57
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,450
In order to get to where aniki is, we must open those doors no matter what happens!

58
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,900
Let's go!

59
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,500
Yeah!

60
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,480
We'll destroy this guy's sandals. Mozu!

61
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,690
Roger. Kiwi!

62
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,460
Kaashii!

63
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,930
Tilestone!

64
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,700
Nailing complete!

65
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,320
You...!

66
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,880
I'll crush you!

67
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,280
Kaashii!

68
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,660
All right!

69
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,810
Bastards...

70
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,160
Guys, let's go for another round!

71
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,890
How are things over there?

72
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,000
At this moment, in front of the Main Island's Gate, Kaashii and Oimo are supposed to be facing the enemy.

73
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,500
There shouldn't be any problem in my opinion.

74
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,640
Is that so?

75
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
Did you capture the Straw Hat who entered the Main Island?

76
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,800
Ah. Err...

77
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,000
As for the estimation, it's approximately four hundred.

78
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,900
Four hundred?

79
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,620
What are you talking about?

80
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,690
I mean the damage report.

81
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,960
Ahh? The damage report!?

82
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,690
You're saying over four hundred soldiers have been beaten!?

83
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,480
Another hundred just added to that...

84
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,800
No, excuse me. I will do the correction.

85
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,790
Of course you will.

86
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,420
The soldiers aren't that weak!

87
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,970
Do you expect me to believe that so many have fallen!?

88
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,830
If there are victims, report them precisely!

89
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,690
Yes, then I'll make my report. For now, the victim count is around five...

90
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,850
Niiiin-!

91
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,630
Five people!?

92
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,100
You mistook it for five people!? Geez, can't you even report properly, damn!

93
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,380
Five...  hundred people...

94
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,470
It looks like Straw Hat Luffy is running around the island without even fighting.

95
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,400
Mah, that's evident!

96
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,540
Capturing an idiot who would face so many soldiers at once is only a matter of time!

97
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,660
You did a good job.

98
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,730
Chief, Lucci's party has just arrived.

99
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,010
They're back?

100
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,530
Let them enter!

101
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,180
It's been a while, Chief.

102
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,190
Wanted for the incident in which government officials were attacked eight years ago...

103
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,090
Here's the criminal Cutty Flam.

104
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,840
As well as the criminal who is wanted for causing that incident twenty years ago at Ohara, located in West Blue,

105
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,920
where Marine battleships were attacked...

106
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,120
Here's Nico Robin. We brought them here without any delay.

107
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,540
Those two are waiting on the other side of this door.

108
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,950
It's great that you came back!

109
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,890
Lucci!

110
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:51,860
Kaku!

111
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,790
Blueno!

112
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,050
Kalifa!

113
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,100
That's sexual harassment.

114
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,580
Just by saying your name!?

115
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,820
It's been a while, Lucci.

116
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,100
Seems like your impudent face hasn't changed a bit.

117
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,440
Same goes for your stupid features, Jyabura.

118
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,250
What?

119
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,190
Won't you two just let it go? What's with the fighting when we just returned?

120
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,060
Yoyoi! That's right, stop this, you two!

121
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:31,730
Isn't this is our first meeting in five years!?

122
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,580
Chapapa...

123
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,680
Chapa...

124
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,050
CHA!

125
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:49,900
PA!

126
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,240
I knew you'd do it right at the start.

127
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,230
Fukurou.

128
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,100
An armed soldier's strength is around ten dourikis. As for you...

129
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,290
Let's see, let's see. What's your strength?

130
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,330
First, Kalifa, 630 dourikis!

131
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,300
Blueno, 820 dourikis.

132
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,960
Kaku, 2200 dourikis.

133
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,230
Lucci...

134
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,620
4000 dourikis!

135
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,200
Four thousand you say!?

136
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,930
Oi, are you saying this for real? I've never heard of such a douriki!

137
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,050
It's true! Everyone got stronger, chapapa!

138
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,920
I know Jyabura and Kumadori's strengths too, so I understood who's stronger!

139
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,250
Oi, that's not fair Fukurou!

140
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,230
Leaving Lucci aside for now, what does the fact that I'm losing to Kaku mean!?

141
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,330
Chapapa! Kaku became stronger too!

142
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,230
Oi! Don't get cocky, Kaku!

143
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,260
The Teawase is a technique to measure your physical strength level only!

144
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,720
In a real fight my Devil Fruit power will count too! Don't forget that I'll never lose to you!

145
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,330
Think of it as you please. I hold no interest in such matters.

146
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,930
That's right. Don't pay attention to the talk of a stray dog.

147
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,060
Who's a stray dog, Lucci?

148
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,330
You monster cat!

149
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,100
Stop this for a bit, you two.

150
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,460
He's acting quite violently, that Jyabura.

151
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:54,000
At this moment, the fact that Jyabura got dumped by the office girl Gyatharin is the hot topic of the Marines on the island!

152
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,810
So that's the reason.

153
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,110
Ho-Hold on!! Why does everyone know about that!?

154
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,510
I talked about it on the Main Island, chapapa!

155
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,050
It was you?

156
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,360
Geez! Don't start fighting over a stupid ranking list.

157
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,410
All of you guys, since you finished the rokushiki training, you are already far surpassing a normal human's strength!

158
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,400
Five hundred dourikis are easily enough to consider yourselves superhuman.

159
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,720
Chief has got nine dourikis. He's the only one, chapapa.

160
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,390
Don't say that, it doesn't matter! I'm just the Chief who gives orders!

161
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,400
Plus, I've got my special sword with me!

162
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,570
We all knew about the Chief's weakness a long time ago.

163
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,800
O-o-o-oi! You shouldn't be so blunt about it, Kalifa!

164
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,730
That's sexual harassment.

165
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,820
Eh!? Because I replied?

166
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,300
Chief.

167
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,700
Wh... What is it?

168
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,080
It's sexual harassment.

169
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,990
My existence is!?

170
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,720
Yoyoi! Kalifa, how rude of you!

171
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,530
Chief! Let me open my stomach to take responsibility for this!

172
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,550
Seppuku!

173
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,190
I can't die...

174
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,190
I already told you to kill yourself!

175
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,040
Could it be? Is it you who stopped me from dying?

176
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,930
My mother in heaven!

177
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,540
Is that how it is!?

178
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,450
Is that so? Your mother is...

179
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,470
Jyabura, can you understand my feelings?

180
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,820
Yeah! I, who have always been rude to you, understand it well now!

181
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,800
The feeling of losing someone important to you!

182
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,390
Mother!!

183
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,930
Gyatharin! Was I not good enough?

184
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,500
Mother!!

185
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,220
Chief...

186
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,260
What is it?

187
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,680
It's over. The skit.

188
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,730
Right...

189
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,300
Anyway, you've done a really good job on your five year long mission.

190
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,480
Not to mention Nico Robin, you even brought back that abominable Cutty Flam with you.

191
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,540
Well done!

192
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,080
Hearing this good news, people from all over the world will praise your talent.

193
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:43,220
Can you understand how proud I, as your Chief, am feeling of you at this moment?

194
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,190
That's right! It's not like a reward for this job, but I have something to give you.

195
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,740
Mah, we'll put that aside from now.

196
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,730
For now, let me meet with them.

197
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,260
With the whole world's hope.

198
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,070
Guys, the time has come!

199
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,710
It's getting late, how about we go?

200
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,210
Those guys should have opened two doors by now!

201
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,240
Let's charge in!

202
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,940
Let's charge in!

203
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,490
Samurai-man! I'll leave that barrier to you!

204
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,580
I'll take care of it.

205
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,720
It hurts!

206
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,800
Hurry up! We don't have a lot of time! Open the gate quickly!

207
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,040
Don't falter! Go for it!

208
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,870
Where is this place?

209
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,870
This passage is hard to walk in!

210
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,870
Whoa! It hurts!

211
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,030
Just you wait, Robin! Don't think you're leaving the crew that easily!

212
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,780
He came out!

213
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,910
Immobilize him!

214
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,090
The Chief calls for you. You two get inside.

215
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,830
We're done for! The Main Gate was closed!

216
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,700
Worrying is unnecessary.

217
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,640
Leave it...

218
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,250
To luck!

219
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,200
Leave it to luck!?

220
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,860
Next time, One Piece: The Means of Escaping is Opened!
Fly through the Sky, Rocketman!

221
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

222
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,240
Here's how you can get your present!

223
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,670
Write the four letters that appeared in the show, your address, your full name, your age,

224
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,240
your opinion of the show and you may win a lot of prizes!

225
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,360
The last keyword is... this!

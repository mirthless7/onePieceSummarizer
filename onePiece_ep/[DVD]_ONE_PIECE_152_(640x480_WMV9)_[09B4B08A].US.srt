1
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,690
Return the gold which you stole
in Papi Head of Diamond!

2
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,180
Gold?

3
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,590
You want to say that of the old Cricket?

4
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,290
GOOD-BYE, STRAW HAT!

5
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,490
WHAT THERE IS?!

6
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,430
OR YOU GO, STRAW HAT?!

7
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,500
Where?

8
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,740
In the sky!

9
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:57,410
Let us sail in the skies!
The rise of Knock-Up Stream

10
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,320
But what it manufactures?!

11
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,770
It is already the morning! The morning!

12
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,170
Forty six minutes of
delay on the agreed schedule!

13
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,140
One goes louper the current!

14
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,290
The weight of gold must
surely to slow down it!

15
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,530
It is too stupid to include
this factor in its calculations!

16
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,800
Not in fact… I believe that it
did not calculate anything of the whole.

17
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,470
You ace 100% reason.

18
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,380
Perhaps that it is
fact of beating downtown…

19
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,980
By this Bellamy?

20
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,270
If it were made beat I kill it
myself, even if it returns per hour!

21
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,590
It is what your problem at the end?

22
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,070
OHEEEE!

23
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,460
Here it is!

24
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,070
Super, it is of return!

25
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,010
I succeeded!

26
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,430
Hurry, Luffy!

27
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,310
It is necessary that the anchor is weighed!

28
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,980
Look at that!

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,510
It is a hercules!

30
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,920
I wasted a time
insane to find it!

31
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,290
A BEETLE KABUTO?!

32
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,780
ANY CA FOR CA?!

33
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,660
Ouah, it is terrible!

34
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,560
The Vogue-Merry, models flying!

35
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,380
IT FLIES!

36
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,000
OUAIP!

37
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,630
They did that for us!

38
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,640
Good in short.

39
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,150
I have like small
apprehension when I see that.

40
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,340
Ouais, me too.

41
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,580
Is necessary to say that a pigeon,
that flies better than a chicken.

42
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,550
It is not what I wanted to say!

43
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,350
Cretin!

44
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,270
Ok! Let us test this boat!

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,090
You are ready, the guys?!

46
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,640
Embark immediately
! You are not in advance.

47
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,260
Unless you prefer to let pass
your chance to go on the celestial island?

48
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,400
Simpleton.

49
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,120
Of agreement! Thank you for the boat!

50
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,840
It is them whom it is necessary to thank.

51
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,250
Thank you, the guy!

52
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,950
I give you my Hercules!

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,830
Really?!

54
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,330
Be too sympathetic for you!

55
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,200
You ES REALLY a NICE BLOKE!

56
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,860
Go, magne
to embark on your ship!

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,040
One will miss it!

58
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,870
One passes at the head! You
have that to follow us!

59
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,720
Quickly, Luffy!

60
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,990
Ouais!

61
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,690
The Gold City forever existed only
in the head of Norland, the liar.

62
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,510
You should make you with the idea that
the dreams are never carried out!

63
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
ALLIED FORCES SARUYAMA!

64
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
OUAIS!

65
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,230
You may find it beneficial to ensure!

66
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,310
No matter what it arrives,
you give to bottom for them!

67
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,090
OUAIS!

68
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,200
Go! It left!

69
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,010
One goes there, the guy!

70
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,970
OK!

71
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,720
Yes, Nami-san!

72
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,310
Small!

73
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,490
It is the hour of separations.

74
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,400
Ouais!

75
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,800
A thing is sure and certain.

76
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,490
Never nobody succeeded in proving that
the celestial island and the Gold City did not exist.

77
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,440
Ouais!

78
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,330
Ca can appear incredible,
some will make fun of you…

79
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,330
But one types oneself some!

80
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,130
Because it is that the adventure!

81
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,490
The adventure…

82
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,270
Exactly!

83
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,140
Thank you… for gold.

84
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,000
And made blunder of
not to fall from the sky!

85
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,340
With more, Papi!

86
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,840
Thank you for all, Cricket-san!

87
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,410
Owner! I am CERTAIN
how the Gold City exists!

88
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,600
Papi, is spared!

89
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,890
Interfere yourself your onions!

90
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,810
It is the morning!

91
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,670
Then? You see something?

92
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,060
Still not of ground in sight!

93
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,170
They really go
on the celestial island?

94
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,730
Ouais, it is what he said.

95
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,590
It will not be part of pleasure
to follow them until over there.

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,590
Then it is necessary that they are wedged front!

97
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,190
Luffy with the Straw hat.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,590
A premium of 100 Million Berrys.

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,790
Listen! It is 7:00!

100
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,130
One should reach our
destination in the neighborhoods of 11:00!

101
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,130
According to what the Owner said…

102
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,430
The place where Knock-Up spouts out
Stream is different each time!

103
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,830
One must thus arrive over there in advance
to be able to locate the places exact!

104
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,890
Look at, look at!

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,130
One is a little with flock…

106
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,340
HE! YOU Me LISTENINGS OR NOT?!

107
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,940
Look at, Regardez, Regardez,
it recovered straight!

108
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,240
Eh Ben, what a funny of bird!

109
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,500
It cannot really look at
elsewhere that towards the South!

110
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,190
A compass would be said!

111
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,640
It is funny!

112
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,480
What did he say?

113
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,570
“I will turn the head in another
direction only for you emmerder! “

114
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,970
I put to you with the challenge!

115
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,070
It points North!

116
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,640
It does not support to be turned
elsewhere than towards the South.

117
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,470
HE, THE GUY!

118
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,070
STOP IRRITATING the BIG BOSS!

119
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,310
They is good, they are good!

120
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,370
It is right which my heart beats
chamade when they are unaware of me!

121
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,270
Ben what? What did one make?

122
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,530
Let us go, that is used for nothing of
to stress with any end of fields!

123
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,030
Let us remain Zen!

124
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,170
You can recall me because
which one is with flock?

125
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,770
It is not wrong!

126
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,970
Four will not be held
hours while stressing!

127
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,270
It is true.

128
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,470
Go, the guy, ahead
all, but with the cool one!

129
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,750
Ouaaiiiiis!           Ouaaiiiiis!

130
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,970
What a good weather!

131
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,840
Are Z' sure that goes?

132
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,870
It is what that?

133
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,770
Sky…

134
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,130
… is black!

135
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,920
Boss! Ca fears!

136
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,820
That there
it has?!

137
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,630
Darkness is in the train
to fall to South-west!

138
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,340
They are impérionimbus!

139
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,760
Ah ouais?! What time is it?

140
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,650
10:00!

141
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,860
It much earlier than is envisaged!

142
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,920
Ca fears…

143
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,260
Shoujou, you can do it?!

144
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,400
Outangs plungers, explore the funds!

145
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,610
Locate the current!

146
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,310
Then it is that a impérionimbus…

147
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,990
What?! What occurs?!

148
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,530
The impérionimbus arrive
more quickly than envisaged!

149
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,890
And one does not have yet
located the current!

150
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,120
Detected echo!

151
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,790
Enormous marine current with 12:00!

152
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,570
Gigantic creature detected with
09:00! Surely a monstre marin!

153
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,750
Vagueness with counter-current
detected with 10:00!

154
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,010
It is perhaps a swirl!

155
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,910
IT IS HELD!

156
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,210
All boats! Cape with 10:00!

157
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,650
It is there that the explosion will occur!

158
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,260
Locate the swirl
and do not give up!

159
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,960
What…?!

160
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,660
The waves are of
more in more violent!

161
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,340
ONE WILL CAPSIZE!

162
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,240
The EXPLOSION DOES NOT GO
TO DELAY! HANG you!

163
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,940
THE EXPLOSION?!

164
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,440
Madam Navigatrice!

165
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,340
What says the Log Poses?

166
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,330
It points right towards this cloud!

167
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,630
Is the celestial island just above?

168
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,840
The wind blows in the same direction.

169
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,790
The impérionimbus is directly thorough
towards the center of the swirl!

170
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,460
Hein, what a swirl?!

171
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,690
Where that?

172
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,890
It would be said that this time
it is the good one, my brother!

173
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,440
Ouais, apparently one will not be
disappointed by the extent of the explosion!

174
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,670
One will arrive there?!

175
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,970
Ouais, of course!

176
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,930
Hein?

177
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,370
One takes you along on
running of the swirl!

178
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,870
And then? What must one make?!

179
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,100
Follow the current!

180
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,290
You bring closer as much as possible to
center swirl and do not give up!

181
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,390
This enormous swirl?!

182
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,350

SKYPIEA-FANSUB

184
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,520
I had never met
of the guy as insane as you.

185
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,330
One wants to go on the celestial island, papi!

186
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,820
Gold was… stolen!

187
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,020
I would be of return
before the lever du jour.

188
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,240
With more, Papi!

189
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,010
To speak about the dreams…

190
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,530
ONE SE WILL MAKE ABSORB!!!

191
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,240
It could have said that it
was necessary to return INSIDE!

192
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,430
Of made you not, Nami-san,
Robin-chan! I will protect you!

193
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,930
I never saw one
swirl of this size!

194
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,360
STOP! STOP CA!

195
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,060
HALF-TURN!

196
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,250
I WANT TO MAKE HALF-TURN!

197
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,570
Do not dream, Usopp!

198
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,470
It is too late.

199
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,970
Y' has of them one which is believed already up there…

200
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,210
CELESTIAL ISLAND, HERE US ARE!!

201
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,350
Go, the guy!

202
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,690
It is with you to play now!

203
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,890
Ouais, thank you for us
to have carried out up to now!

204
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,890
WAIT!

205
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,690
MADE ME NOT THIS BLOW IT!

206
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,390
I AI TOO FUNK!

207
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,390
I WANT TO RETURN, BROTHEL!

208
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,230
ONE WILL BURST!

209
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,580
NOBODY HAD SPEAKS to Me
Of a GIANT SWIRL!

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,710
It IS SWINDLES! SWINDLES!

211
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,690
AHH! IT MAKES ANY BLACK!

212
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,390
THE SWIRL US
ASPIRE MORE AND MORE!

213
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,570
One will be aspired, Luffy!

214
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,240
It is not yet too late!

215
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,740
You include/understand, hein?!

216
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,060
This swirl can all kill us!

217
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,040
This celestial island is not
how one dream in a dream!

218
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,530
A dream in a dream?

219
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,410
I see…

220
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,820
It rightly, Luffy!

221
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,080
I do not believe in being
able in any event!

222
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,080
An island which is only one
dreams in a dream?

223
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,080
I cannot let pass one
formidable adventure like that one!

224
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,680
Ca…

225
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,390
Ca amuses it…

226
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,390
He! While you
waste your time with râler…

227
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,290
Hein?

228
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,010
What still?

229
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,490
One arrives at the center of the swirl.

230
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,600
Quickly, Nami-san,
tighten yourself against me!

231
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,000
ONE FALLS!

232
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,460
Hein? It is finished?

233
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,330
How?

234
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,290
What did it occur?

235
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,290
This giant swirl…

236
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,110
What occurs?

237
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,830
Not…

238
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,790
It is not finished!

239
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,030
The center of the swirl has
touched the ocean floor.

240
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,250
It is not true…

241
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,410
STOOOP!

242
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,110
He, Zoro!

243
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,410
Look at!

244
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,960
You are held!

245
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,560
Luffy with the Straw hat!

246
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,660
It is the type of Mock Town!

247
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,480
Who that?

248
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,590
I come for the premium from 100 Million!

249
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,770
Go!

250
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,370
He, which they is these
? Friends with them?

251
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,170
No idea!

252
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,260
Why does it make so dark here?

253
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,620
My premium?

254
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,270
About which 100 Million you speak?

255
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,770
Then, do not be to you with the current…

256
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,370
Your head is put at price
to 100 Million Berrys!

257
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,270
And Zoro, the Hunter of Pirates!

258
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,470
You are worth 60 Million Berrys!

259
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,550
It is true!

260
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,260
There are new posters.

261
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,350
Zoro, you ace a premium now!

262
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,340
Hein?!

263
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,240
He, wait!

264
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,340
And me then?!

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,580
I have some too?

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,480
Heu… not.

267
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,530
Look at well!

268
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,080
Not.

269
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,210
I see.

270
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,170
It is because of
events of Alabasta…

271
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,830
But 100 Million…

272
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,890
100 Million!

273
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,190
Hear you that? I am worth 100 Million!

274
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,880
I am disappointed a little of my 60 Million!

275
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,820
Y' DOES NOT HAVE WHAT SE TO DELIGHT, YOU TWO!

276
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,570
He, the guy!

277
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,570
Remain concentrates!

278
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,870
Here…

279
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,430
Knock-Up Stream!

280
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,990
HOLD YOU READY!

281
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,330
What?

282
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,560
You stud or
take refuge in the cabins!

283
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,100
The OCEAN WILL EXPLODE!!

284
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,390
MADE BLUNDER!

285
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,730
THE BOAT WILL CAPSIZE!

286
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,990
HOLD GOOD!

287
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,290
DO NOT PASS OVER EDGE!!

288
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,630
The CELESTIAL ISLAND AWAIT YOU!

289
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,040
C-C' is what this is delirious?!

290
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,970
The boat sails in vertical
on the surface of the marine current!

291
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,540
It is brilliant!

292
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,170
HOW CAN YOU SAY CA?!

293
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,410
Wind…

294
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,370
Go! On the way towards the sky!

295
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,730
SINK, MERRY!

296
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,290
Wait a little! I fear
how it either not so simple!

297
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,280
Q - What
you want to say?!

298
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,070
That there
does it have?

299
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,480
You ace forgotten something in bottom?

300
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,880
The hull starts with
to detach from surface!

301
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,780
This train, one will be done
to eject before being crushed!

302
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,760
C-C' is quite pretty all that, but…

303
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,430
Q - what one
must make?!

304
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,030
It is already hardly if one
manage to remain studded!

305
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,710
It is what that?!

306
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,580
A monstre marin!

307
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,710
That which the swirl had absorbed!

308
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,900
Look at!

309
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,970
One is likely to join it
in step a long time!

310
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,300
He, Ho, perhaps well, but…

311
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,320
it is the blast of the explosion
who propelled us!

312
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,760
One can more nothing make!

313
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,770
Then it is really a disaster!

314
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,370
Y' HAS DEBRITS WHICH
WE FALL ABOVE!

315
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,120
VICTIMS OF KNOCK-UP STREAM!

316
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,120
One is lost!

317
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120
One will fall, to be crushed
on the ocean and to die!

318
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,890
Set the sails, now!

319
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,710
It is a current sailor.

320
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,540
Not a simple water column!

321
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,080
It is a current ascending sailor!

322
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,880
And the breath which propelled us comes from a mixture of vapor and heat!

323
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,030
An ascending airstream!

324
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,830
If sea and wind are
part, I can sail!

325
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,330
Who it is the navigatrice of the crew?

326
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,130
It IS NAMI-SAN!

327
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,870
He, louts!

328
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,570
Made what Nami-san known as!

329
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,740
OK!

330
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,340
That somebody takes the bar,
the wind comes from starboard!

331
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,840
Align the boat on the current!

332
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,040
YES, CHIEF!!

333
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,140
Oh not!

334
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,940
One falls apart of surface!

335
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,780
One falls! Nami, one falls!

336
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,220
Do something, Nami!

337
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,180
One will arrive there!

338
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,220
ONE FLIES AWAY!!

339
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,620
BRILLIANT!

340
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,620
ONE FLOATS IN THE AIRS!

341
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,970
I dream or what?!

342
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,630
And here!

343
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,630
NAMI-SAN, YOU ES MARVELLOUS!

344
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,730
AND I LOVE YOU!!

345
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,530
Go! Sail beyond
imperceptible dream!

346
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,620
GO AHEAD!!

347
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,580
For little which one remains aligned
on the current with this wind…

348
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,610
one will go as high as it will be wanted!

349
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,570
He, Nami!

350
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,620
Does one go
to reach the celestial island?!

351
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,020
If it exists, it must
to find other side of this cloud!

352
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,220
Above the clouds…

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,420
I wonder what
we wait over there!

354
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,340
ONE ENTERS the IMPERIONIMBUS!

355
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,140
Let us gather all our dreams,

356
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,040
We leave to
search for our destinies…

357
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,550
Let us leave the compass,
it would delay us,

358
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,900
Let yourself pack,
and take the bar!

359
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,970
Even an old chart with the treasure…

360
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,130
is not any more one legend if
you prove his veracity!

361
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,540
Let us forget simply our own concern,

362
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,940
let us remain in symbiosis
ones others…

363
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,660
and let us not think of it any more!

364
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:33,930
Let us gather all our dreams,

365
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:39,300
We leave to
search for our destinies…

366
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,630
The pocket filled with parts,

367
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,480
And do you want to be my friend?

368
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,070
We are, us
sums… of the voyage!

1
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,750
Remain there, Robin!

2
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,050
The discution is not finished!

3
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,350
If, it is it.

4
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,350
We will not be re-examined any more.

5
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,250
Luffy, hurries to catch up with Robin!

6
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,350
Robin!

7
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,050
From where does this force come to them?

8
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,250
Who be you?!

9
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,350
We are the CP9.

10
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,450
This mission is a business of state.

11
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,150
We will not let to you interfere.

12
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,550
It is time of déclancher the fire. We must hurry.

13
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,349
As long as one is there…

14
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,650
I would like to show you something.

15
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,950
A fruit of the demon!

16
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,250
What a kind of fruit?!

17
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,250
Lucci, you…

18
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,349
The fruit Neko Neko.

19
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,250
[Neko = cat]

20
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,050
Model Leopard.

21
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,050
A man-leopard.

22
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,750
Enormous!

23
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,050
What…

24
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,250
THAT WANTS TO SAY?!

25
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:35,750
End of the crew of Straw hat?

26
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:35,750
Terrifying model leopard!

27
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,550
With fire!

28
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,949
Oi, you awake all!

29
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,450
Is whore, they the pirates who did that?

30
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,850
There are still many people inside.

31
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,049
And Iceberg-san?! It is still on the floor?!

32
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,050
Allons-y!

33
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,150
Dispatch you, the others! Etteignez fire!

34
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,850
It would seem that the incendit was declared.

35
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,150
Man-leopard or not…

36
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,350
I you will not let raise the hand on Iceberg-san!

37
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,550
Ca becomes complicated! Zoan “carnivores” are extremely violent one!

38
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,150
Indeed, standard Logia, standard Zoan, standard Paramecia.

39
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,450
All have their own characteristic.

40
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,750
That of Zoan, it is the increase in the physical force.

41
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,250
The more one involves oneself, the more one dvient extremely.

42
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,950
The Zoan type is the best for the close combat.

43
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,050
The farm!

44
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,750
I insane of what a filth of monster can say!

45
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,050
There is no time to us.

46
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,950
We must eliminate you before making us surprise by the flames.

47
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,750
Iceberg-san!

48
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,650
Lucci, the workmen arrive.

49
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,350
It does not matter, they will not arrive up to now.

50
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,350
RANKYAKU

51
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,750
Behind! Very collapses!

52
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,050
Nami!

53
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,850
Chopper!

54
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,749
Paulee, which do you make?

55
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,250
I will leave you from here, costs whom costs.

56
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,550
You will not be able with your wounds!

57
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,150
Stop, Paulee.

58
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,550
Do not call me by my name like that!

59
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,550
Release from my way!

60
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,950
Whore!

61
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,850
Why you, the guy?!

62
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,050
I have…

63
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,650
At least, I had…

64
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,750
ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT YOU WERE MY COMPANIONS!

65
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,050
You are well only.

66
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,849
The guy with the pigeon!

67
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,250
Straw hat!

68
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,750
SHIGAN

69
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,850
Luffy!

70
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,350
Insane the camp of this island!

71
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,250
Luffy!

72
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,650
Whore!

73
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,550
TEKKAI

74
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,750
Zoro!

75
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,450
You too.

76
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,850
Grandmother, Grandmother! A giant fire!

77
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,750
They are the offices of Galley it. They make really horrible things.

78
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,149
Too bad? It is somebody who put fire?

79
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,650
And well, I do not know.

80
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,749
But I have a bad presentiment.

81
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,450
I hope that Iceberg is well.

82
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,950
My faith, if this thing had not existed…

83
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,750
Testimonys of pirates do not have any value.

84
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,850
And this business will remain irresolute.

85
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,350
Iceberg-san, you have beautiful being a large naval engineer…

86
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,450
Or even a large mayor…

87
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,050
A citizen should not be opposed to the government.

88
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,250
Let us see the other apprentice of Tom, Franky…

89
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,450
Or rather Cutty Flam, to take the sketches of the Ancestral Weapon to him.

90
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:50,350
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

91
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,649
Is everyone outside?

92
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,549
One cannot return any more inside!

93
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,450
Check all if it does not miss anybody!

94
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,350
Is Oi, where Iceberg-san? You saw it?

95
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,049
Did not say to me that it is still inside!

96
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,850
It is inevitably well!

97
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,250
The engineers are with him. It cannot be there!

98
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,150
The guy, seek in the neighborhoods!

99
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,750
This girl belongs to the crew of Straw hat. No doubt!

100
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,550
Would it have jumped of the window?

101
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,850
It was made surprise by the flames and could not escape any more.

102
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,150
What does one have to make of it?

103
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,850
Whore, which they have fact is horrible.

104
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,850
One will make him acknowledge where are the different ones!

105
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,150
We all will catch them and will deliver them to the navy!

106
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,949
Was Blueno, Franky in your bar?

107
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,749
Yes, but it had left to research Straw hat.

108
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,950
I see.

109
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,550
It cannot remain in place, that one.

110
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,850
On the other hand, there are some who will have much less chance.

111
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,050
Look at.

112
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,050
Listen well, Straw hat!

113
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,149
There is tankard the Length-Nose!

114
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,049
Ouais, one had it!

115
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,749
If you do not want that one transforms it into sardine…

116
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,550
Baka! How much time should I repeat it to you?

117
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,149
You must say:“If you do not want that it finishes at the sea-bed”!

118
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,049
Tea!

119
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,050
SEA!

120
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,249
Cretin, you me listenings never!

121
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,449
Most important, it is that Straw hat includes/understands, not?

122
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,549
He will include/understand anything by saying that!

123
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,549
You will be made botter the bottom by Aniki.

124
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,650
“If you do not want to see it running at the ocean floor, go to the warehouse, under the bridge! On behalf of Franky!”

125
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,050
How that!

126
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:48,350
It will be made burst, if it is pointed.

127
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,850
Who waits who? And at which place?

128
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,850
Be to you which, you?

129
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,650
One is occupied! Break!

130
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,250
If you hold with the life, you have three seconds to answer.

131
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,149
It is what this joke?

132
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,450
Do you know at least which Aniki one speaks?

133
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,150
What do you want to say by “the warehouse, under the bridge”?

134
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,250
Is Franky over there?

135
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,650
It is what your problem with Aniki?

136
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,250
You must to initially say us!

137
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,350
You gave up your companions of East Blue for your boat!

138
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,249
Why do you cry?

139
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,150
Baka! One does not cry! Baka!

140
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,449
It is right which… You split me the heart to want to protect your all alone boat.

141
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,249
We do not cry! None us cries!

142
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,250
What do they have?

143
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,850
At all events, you include/understand or not?

144
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,050
We are not any more companions!

145
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,950
Then…

146
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,949
Such an amount of cruelty. I will sing this ballade:

147
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,349
“Broken Friendship. Rupture of the Wind of North.”

148
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,249
Yay, Aniki!

149
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,550
You foutez yourselves of my mouth?!

150
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,950
Oi, still not of tea? I am assoifé.

151
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,750
Yes, a moment.

152
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,550
I am burst through chialer.

153
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,450
Even if I did not chialé.

154
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,250
Here is, Aniki. It is a little hot.

155
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,050
Thank you.

156
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,950
Of agreement, I included/understood, Nii-chan.

157
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,049
THAT BURNS!

158
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,150
Calm yourself a little!

159
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,850
Afflicted for all, Aniki.

160
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,850
You should take some, you too.

161
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,750
Would be honnète, you must us want of it with dead since one you ace taken your 200 million.

162
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,950
Especially if that finished in argument between you.

163
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,550
Do not make any you for that.

164
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,250
Resentment is not used for nothing.

165
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,250
Spoken well, I include/understand.

166
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,750
However, the 200 million…

167
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,850
I very spent!

168
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,850
I go you foutre a beating!

169
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,850
Let us go, does not irritate you like that.

170
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,950
But with as much of aggressiveness…

171
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,550
You believe that I can pass sponge?

172
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,050
To have demolished my house, Franky House.

173
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,249
More all wounds of my men.

174
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,449
BANDAGE JERKS!

175
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,449
Aniki!

176
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,050
Your anger returned!

177
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,649
Good, much things did without, but Nii-chan…

178
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,549
One will calm both a little…

179
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,249
And to take measurements which settle.

180
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,949
It is “which is essential”.

181
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,350
They is “which is essential”, Aniki.

182
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,350
Good, one of fout.

183
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,850
What will you make all alone now?

184
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,650
Now, you do not have nowhere where to go.

185
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,350
Then one will deal with you.

186
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,350
Become one of my men!

187
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,449
I love you well.

188
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,150
Not question. I do not intend at all to become desossor.

189
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,250
Even if I left the crew, I remain a pirate.

190
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,949
You will hear:“Honor of the Pirate”.

191
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,850
Yay, Aniki!

192
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,050
You still foutez yourselves of my mouth?!

193
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,149
I think of future, guy.

194
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,850
I of insane, me.

195
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,050
You could not go to slacken you elsewhere?

196
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,250
Does the high tide arrive this evening, not true?

197
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,350
Ouais, and it is for that.

198
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,350
We must help each other when Aqua Laguna arrives.

199
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,250
In the neighborhoods of midnight, the houses of the first two floors will be under water.

200
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,050
This moment, there should be nobody close to the shore or in the streets.

201
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,250
If you leashes your boat here, that will go.

202
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,150
Oh, thank you.

203
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:58,949
It is very pleasant.

204
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,950
Baka! They is good, are with collects to you so much!

205
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,550
But doesn't that disturb you to have to undergo this high tide every year?

206
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,050
We took all the practice to take refuge each year.

207
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,350
The problem, it is that the level of water does not cease increasing every year.

208
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,650
The low city which you see…

209
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,050
At summer built on the ruins of an old city, several hundred years ago.

210
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,450
A long time ago, the island of the shipyard and the low city formed only one.

211
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,050
And now that it is immersed, it is called the Quoted Watery one.

212
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,350
The streets became channels.

213
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:44,050
In fact, it is not the level of the water which goes up, but the ground which goes down.

214
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,350
If that continuous, it will become impossible to live downtown.

215
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,150
I see.

216
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,450
This splendid Watery Citée is not perfect.

217
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:01,350
But if that becomes too dangerous, you will have only to change island with Umi Ressha.

218
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,250
One can say that.

219
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,650
But Umi Ressha was installed there are a few tens of years.

220
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,450
Before that, it was very difficult to cross the ocean.

221
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,450
Naturally, there was not as much traffic on the island.

222
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,650
The inhabitants were done with the idea…

223
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,550
That this isolated island would run one day, the city and all that goes with.

224
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,450
But a thing made disappear concerns…

225
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,750
It was Umi Ressha, “Puffing Tom”.

226
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,650
Henceforth, everyone can cross the ocean without log, it is a revolution.

227
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,450
Then it was thus.

228
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,050
Umi Ressha is really enthralling.

229
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,750
Toilets 7 were restored…

230
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,650
All that thanks to the great Tom genius, which invented Umi Ressha.

231
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,750
This man all saved us.

232
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,250
Aniki!

233
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,750
Help us…

234
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,850
I will pass the hello to your Aniki.

235
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,450
We know where it is.

236
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,250
Allons-y.

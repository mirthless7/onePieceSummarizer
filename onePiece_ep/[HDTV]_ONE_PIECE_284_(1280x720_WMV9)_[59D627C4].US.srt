1
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,560
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,850
The man who had acquired everything in this
 world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,590
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,790
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,280
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,470
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,960
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,970
Twenty years ago...

10
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,270
It stole everything away from me,

11
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,420
and crushed a lot of people's lives.

12
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,040
All thanks to a single attack...

13
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,510
The Buster Call.

14
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,950
This same attack...

15
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,630
...has finally shown up.

16
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,910
It's aimed at the nakama that I finally met and trust.

17
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,790
The more I wish to be by your sides,

18
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,170
the more my fate will bare its fangs to you!

19
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,780
No matter how far I continue my journey on the sea,

20
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,150
there's still that gigantic enemy I can't shake off!

21
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,690
Because my enemy is...

22
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,200
...the world and its darkness!

23
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,940
That time with Aokiji, and now this.

24
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,420
I've gotten you all involved twice already.

25
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,550
If this keeps up forever, even as easy going as you all are...

26
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Someday you'll see me as a burden!

27
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,180
It's obvious that someday you'll betray me and throw me away!

28
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,050
That's what scares me the most!

29
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,120
That's why I didn't want you to come save me!

30
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,410
If it's a life I'll lose someday,

31
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,210
I want to die right here and now!

32
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,490
I understand now!

33
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,200
That's right on the mark!

34
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,780
That's exactly it!

35
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,790
There's no one out there who'd be stupid enough to not think you're a burden after traveling with you!

36
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,370
Look at this flag, pirate scum!

37
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,940
That mark!

38
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,450
It represents the unity of over 170 United Nations dotted in the four seas and the Grand Line!

39
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,000
This is the world!

40
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,300
Do you even get how insignificant your existences are compared to this?

41
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,020
Do you understand how powerful the organization after this woman is?!

42
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,470
I understand Robin's enemy very well...

43
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,400
Sogeking.

44
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,820
Make that flag...

45
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,690
...burst into flames.

46
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,020
Roger that.

47
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,430
My new weapon, the Giant Pachinko.

48
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,700
The name is Kabuto!

49
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,840
Behold the power of this weapon!

50
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,750
Hisatsu! Firebird Star!

51
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,800
They didn't...

52
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,030
Done.

53
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,380
They... They did it!

54
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,120
Do these guys know what it means to shoot a flag?

55
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,150
The pirates just...

56
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,160
They declared war on the World Government!

57
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,280
Are you out of your mind?!

58
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,840
Don't think you'll be able to survive having the world as your enemy!

59
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,220
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR!!

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,280
Robin!

61
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,520
I still haven't heard it from your mouth!

62
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,100
SAY YOU WANT TO LIVE!!

63
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,210
Robin.

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,750
Robin!

65
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,370
To live...

66
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,890
I thought wishing for it was forbidden...

67
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,560
No one ever allowed me that...

68
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,220
The sea is vast.

69
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,810
Someday, without any doubt,

70
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,490
nakama who will protect you will appear.

71
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
Believe in Luffy.

72
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,130
If...

73
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,940
If I'm allowed to declare my wish...

74
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,740
Then I...

75
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,250
I WANT TO LIVE!!

76
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,490
TAKE ME OUT TO THE SEA WITH YOU!!

77
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,630
I love you guys!

78
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,810
Damn it!

79
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:04,890
Let's go!

80
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm Not Giving You The Blueprint! Franky's Decision

81
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,380
Alright! We pulled the lever!

82
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,200
WE DID IT!!

83
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,880
Looks like Mozu and them did it, too!

84
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,480
GO, STRAW HAT!!

85
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,010
The bridge is being lowered!

86
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,800
Looks like those guys did it.

87
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,120
What great timing.

88
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
Trembles from excitement...

89
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,680
Hurry up and lower it!

90
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,680
What an evil looking face...

91
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:38,860
Robin!

92
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,230
We'll save you no matter what!

93
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,430
DON'T COME!!

94
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,990
They have good spirit.

95
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
To not fear the government's flag...

96
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,950
It's useless...

97
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,470
They can't possibly match up to us.

98
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,670
DON'T COME!!

99
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,620
The drawbridge is lowering!

100
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,050
Go, Straw Hat-san!!

101
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,960
Damn you, pirates!

102
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,490
We won't let you!

103
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,670
Prepare the mortar cannon!

104
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,900
Stop the drawbridge, even if you have to demolish it!

105
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,800
Yes!

106
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,340
I won't let you do that!

107
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,470
PIPE HITCH KNIVES!!

108
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,800
It's all over for you!

109
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,890
DISMANTLE CHOP!!

110
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Judge Baskerville!

111
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,890
Too bad!

112
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,040
We were really a trio of judges!

113
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,430
What?!

114
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,770
Me on the left, my real name is Bas!

115
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,350
And me on the right, my real name is Kerville!

116
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,450
And me in the middle, I am...

117
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,150
A princess!

118
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,580
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

119
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,370
It was just the three of them stuck together?

120
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,060
What for?

121
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,240
Because we're the best of friends~!!

122
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,880
SHUT UP!!

123
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,550
Shoot!

124
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,760
Use the mortar!

125
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,190
The drawbridge stopped?!

126
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,770
They're getting in our way!

127
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,140
What is this?! Damn it!

128
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,510
WHO WAS IT?!

129
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,010
Chief Spandam!

130
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,220
Escape from the Tower of Justice!

131
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,190
G-Good! You did well!

132
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,630
We'll head to the Gates of Justice before they get here!

133
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,290
Oi, Nico Robin!

134
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,950
Somebody, take in Cutty Flam!

135
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:11,980
Robin!

136
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,770
They don't have what it takes.

137
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,180
They're just mere pirates...

138
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,590
We have the assassination group, CP9!

139
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,030
The survivor from the island of scholars that planned to revive a weapon...

140
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,050
Nico Robin.

141
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,820
And the man who inherited this weapon's blueprints...

142
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,520
Cutty Flam.

143
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,540
There's no way that I'd miss an opportunity as great as this to gain such immense power!

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,730
Cutty Flam.

145
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,840
Those are...

146
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,780
You couldn't possibly...

147
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,410
The blueprints of the ancient weapon, Pluton.

148
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,240
It's the real thing.

149
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,930
Do you believe me?

150
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,180
Lucci, Kaku.

151
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,450
You guys can tell, right?

152
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,470
I didn't think you would, but...

153
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,910
You were hiding it inside yourself this whole time?

154
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,420
Is it... Is it real?

155
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,540
Is it the real thing?!

156
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,000
Give them here! Give them to me!

157
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,850
My long-awaited blueprints!

158
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
Nico Robin.

159
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,720
I guess you really can't rely on the rumors of society...

160
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,770
During the time it took to get to this shithole,

161
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,000
I found out you're not the devil that would put the weapon to use for no good.

162
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,770
In the first place...

163
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,590
What the ship workers of Water 7 inherited from generation to generation...

164
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,390
It wasn't a blueprint for how to build a weapon.

165
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,610
Such a great task was left unfinished by Tom-san.

166
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,610
Tom-san attempted a great task and left it unfinished.

167
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,610
The blueprint worth sacrificing everything to pass on to the future.

168
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,280
As long as there's the danger that this woman called Nico Robin can revive ancient weapons,

169
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,940
this weapon is needed by the world as a power of resistance.

170
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,930
Hey, Spanda.

171
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,590
What Tom-san and Iceburg tried to protect with their lives is...

172
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,860
Hurry up and give it to me!

173
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,500
If the ancient weapon were to fall into the hands of an idiot like you and let loose,

174
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,390
then a weapon would be needed to be built in order to resist that.

175
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,820
To contain a reckless outbreak is this designer's wish.

176
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,500
It's true...

177
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,600
If you use Nico Robin, then you could revive the ancient weapon.

178
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,000
Even if it's not her intention,

179
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,120
as long as there's a chance that she could be used to do so, then she's a dangerous woman.

180
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,520
But for her, she has nakama that don't hesitate when looking into the face of death.

181
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,210
That's why I'm...

182
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,040
...gonna make a bet.

183
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,610
At this moment...

184
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,880
If there's a chance to fulfill this designer's dream, then there's only one thing I can do.

185
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,590
Stop blabbering and give it to me immediately!

186
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,230
They're mine!

187
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,660
Tom-san...

188
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,800
In this situation, you would probably also...

189
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,120
At this moment...

190
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,360
If there's a chance to fulfill this designer's dream, then there's only one thing I can do.

191
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,950
Stop blabbering and give it to me immediately!

192
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,710
They're mine!

193
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,220
Tom-san...

194
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,360
In this situation, you would probably also...

195
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,460
You! What are you doing?!

196
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,120
It's burnt to a crisp!

197
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,220
Damn it! I'm gonna kill you!!

198
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,620
Our five year long mission...

199
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,770
The blueprint that was intended to be used to resist power,

200
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,560
was also sought after by the government.

201
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,480
In reality, the existence of this thing was kept a secret.

202
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,730
It should be destroyed once it's been revealed.

203
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,020
Now, there's no power to resist the ancient weapon.

204
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,450
If Nico Robin is to be taken by you now, the world will end.

205
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,240
But if the Straw Hats win...

206
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,830
What you'll have left, is absolutely nothing at all.

207
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,940
Personally, I'm betting on their victory.

208
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,460
How could you do such a stupid thing...?

209
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,400
I guess you wanna die here now too, huh?

210
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,660
ANIKI!!

211
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,800
ANIKI!!

212
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,360
FRANKY ANIKI!!

213
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,610
Oi, look!

214
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,200
Aniki is up on the Tower of Justice!

215
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,600
That's great! He's okay!

216
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Hey! It's aniki!

217
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,980
Aniki!

218
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,770
We came to help you!

219
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,400
WE CAME WITH THE STRAW HATS!!

220
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,330
SODOM AND GOMORRAH WORKED HARD TOO!!

221
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,640
ANIKI!!

222
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,550
COME HOME WITH US!!

223
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,000
YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU?!

224
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,460
You... You guys!

225
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,840
You guys... Damn it!

226
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,770
Who asked you to come help me?

227
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,270
To come...

228
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,390
WHO ASKED YOU TO?!

229
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,400
YOU DUMBASSES!!

230
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,540
DAMN IT!!

231
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,480
I'M NOT CRYING!!

232
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,110
SHUT UP!!

233
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,420
ALL OF YOU!!

234
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,570
Hey! Are you the devil?!

235
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,160
ROBIN'S WAITING!!

236
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,190
HURRY AND LOWER THE BRIDGE!!

237
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,500
Oh yeah, that's right.

238
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,720
HURRY UP, YOU MORONS!!

239
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,680
That's right, huh?!

240
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,290
You morons better hurry up!

241
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,520
I'll kick your asses!!

242
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,330
Th-That's true...

243
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,150
e& I love Nami-san even when she says incoherent things~!! e&

244
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,010
Oi! Straw Hat!

245
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,740
Seems like you took care of my subordinates.

246
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,490
This time, the master carpenter,

247
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,580
the one and only Franky will be your super  great fighting power!

248
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,130
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT!!

249
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,080
I'M STILL PISSED AT YOU ABOUT USOPP!!

250
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,620
But he's right next to you...

251
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,720
Cutty Flam.

252
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,690
Why did you...?

253
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,430
To my blueprint...

254
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,540
ANIKI!!

255
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,720
ANIKI'S FALLING INTO THE WATERFALL~!!

256
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,230
FRANKY!!

257
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,220
Oi, you pirates!

258
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,830
Kokoro-san?!

259
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,510
I can hear everything.

260
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,380
What are you lingering around for?

261
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,320
Lingering around? But the bridge is only halfway...

262
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,460
Halfway is more than enough!

263
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,060
I'll be there in four more seconds.

264
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,560
So jump into the waterfall with all you've got!

265
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,160
Hey, that's from earlier!

266
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,420
Was it the baasan? What did she mean?

267
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,460
I don't know, but she said to jump into the waterfall.

268
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,980
The sea train!

269
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,650
Why is it in the Courthouse?!

270
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,550
Chimney, ring the bell as lively as you can!

271
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,480
Okay!

272
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,560
The sea train?

273
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,320
What's the meaning of that smile?

274
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,260
Judge!!

275
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,760
Please get out of the way!!

276
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,420
STOP RIGHT THERE!!

277
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,570
HERE WE GO!!

278
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,020
It can still run, the Rocketman!

279
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,540
Don't underestimate the legendary shipbuilding company, Tom's Workers!

280
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,960
Rocketman?!

281
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,040
IT FLEW!!

282
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,680
THEY CAME OVER!!

283
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,980
It's a waterfall!

284
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,680
Seems like the old times, Tom-san!

285
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,560
I did indeed help a man named Roger...

286
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,110
AND I'M MIGHTY PROUD OF IT!!

287
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,850
I'm Luffy.

288
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm the man who's gonna be the Pirate King.

289
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,270
Really?

290
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,810
Yeah.

291
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,670
That guy Roger was also...

292
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,510
He was an idiot too, wasn't he?

293
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,550
And you helped him out, didn't you?

294
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,870
Outrageously,

295
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,140
the entire Tom's Workers' family are helping the Straw Hat now.

296
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,540
You would've done the same, wouldn't you?

297
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,830
Tom-san?

298
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,420
WE'RE GONNA HIT IT!!

299
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,880
WE'RE GONNA CRASH!!

300
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,780
If this goes on, Robin's in danger.

301
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,430
We have to do something before she passes through the Gates of Justice.

302
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,140
So we have to beat the guys from CP9,

303
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,950
and get our hands on five different keys.

304
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,560
Anyway, we don't have time.

305
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,410
Everyone has to win!

306
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,190
Wait for us, Robin.

307
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,890
Next time, One Piece: Capture the 5 Keys!
The Straw Hats Versus CP9.

308
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,270
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

1
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,530
Wealth, Fame, Power.

2
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,830
The man who had acquired everything in this
 world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.

3
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,550
The final words that were said at his execution sent people to the seas.

4
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,760
My wealth and treasures?

5
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,260
If you want it, I'll let you have it.

6
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,430
Look for it, I left it all in that place.

7
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,390
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.

8
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,940
The world enters the Great Age of Pirates!

9
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,820
I can see the Gates of Justice, but can I get across on a regular boat?

10
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
Anyway, there's no time!

11
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,060
I've gotta try something!

12
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,670
Here I go!

13
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,170
Pirate-niichan!

14
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,700
What are you doing?!

15
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,350
Sanji-kun.

16
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,650
Were you really unable to win?

17
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,020
Did you really fight properly?

18
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,630
Your opponent was that woman, wasn't it?

19
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,360
You're soft on women, aren't you?

20
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,090
I'm sorry about the key.

21
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
That's not it!

22
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,020
I'm just saying that you could die because of your stupid way of chivalry!

23
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,920
Are you still gonna honor it, even when you end up like this?

24
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,500
What are you gonna do if you die?!

25
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,550
It's not...

26
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,450
...like I wanna die.

27
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,800
However, I've been raised to never  kick a woman.

28
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,690
That's why...

29
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,010
...even if I die, I will never kick a woman!

30
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,150
You're so stupid.

31
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,250
You idiot!

32
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,520
Oi! What are you doing, Nami?!

33
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,010
If running away is also against your way of chivalry,

34
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,920
then at least throw that away!

35
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,510
To die without a cause is a different story entirely!

36
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,690
Leave that woman to me...

37
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,740
And also,

38
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,390
I've changed my opinion about your way of chivalry.

39
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,680
Did you just say you love me more?

40
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,300
She didn't say that!

41
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,140
I'm not as nice as that guy.

42
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,360
Me neither.

43
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,930
Looks like we'll get along well.

44
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,490
Yoyoi!

45
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,160
Hold on now~!

46
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,220
That octopus guy!

47
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,010
I won't! I won't let you escape~!

48
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,710
Nami, go get that woman.

49
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,720
I'll deal with this guy!

50
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,480
Got it!

51
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,960
Yoi! Yoi! Yoyoyoi~!

52
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,110
I won't let you get in the way!

53
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,010
Kokutei!

54
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,180
CROSS

55
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,470
Why you little~!

56
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,260
You, again~!

57
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,470
Your opponent will be me!

58
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,870
Come on!

59
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:30,090
The Silent Owl's Miscalculation! My Cola Is The Water of Life.

60
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,780
Geez! There's no way you can cross the ocean with a boat like this!

61
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,830
Are you stupid or what?!

62
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,460
But, you...

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,890
Robin's been taken to that Gate!

64
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,710
I have to hurry, or I won't be able to bring her back!

65
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,240
I should be able to reach that building in front.

66
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,200
Hold on, what are you gonna do?!

67
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,070
Wait, pirate-niichan! Calm down!

68
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,950
If I can't get across the ocean, then I have no choice but to fly across!

69
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,490
We came here to tell you...

70
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,920
...about a way to get to the Gates of Justice!

71
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,180
What the hell is this place? A basement?

72
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,660
It's the ocean's underground passage.

73
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,490
To get to the Gates of Justice, you have to go under the ocean.

74
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,480
Is that right?

75
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,620
Alright!

76
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,220
Wait! Do you even know how to get there?!

77
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,030
You're really amazing, you know?

78
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,020
How did you know about this?

79
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,580
Earlier the guy with Lucci came through here laughing really loud,

80
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,130
so we just followed them!

81
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,070
Guy with Lucci

82
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,450
If they don't know the entrance, there's no way they can follow us!

83
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,920
They're such fools!

84
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,670
Lucci and the black-haired neechan went through the doors, too.

85
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,070
This door, right?

86
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,020
It's a pretty hard steel door.

87
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,840
You know how to open it?

88
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,810
The guy with Lucci was touching something around here, so....

89
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,790
It must operate with the keyhole over here!

90
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,070
But, there's no key....

91
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,130
You guys, stand back.

92
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,790
What are you gonna do?

93
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,280
I can get to the Gates of Justice from here, right?

94
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,520
Gear Third!

95
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,810
It opened...

96
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,990
Alright! I'm going then!

97
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,940
Why did you become so small?!

98
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,220
You're so funny, pirate-niichan!

99
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,430
Alright, we still have more work to do!

100
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,020
W-Wasn't there a really loud noise just now?

101
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,190
Is it my imagination?

102
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,570
No, that can't be it.

103
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,920
Perhaps it was the sound of one of the pirates destroying the door...

104
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,250
What?! How could something that stupid happen?!

105
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,630
You mean that thick steel door?

106
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,490
First of all, there's no way they could have found it.

107
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,590
No, they should know.

108
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,870
A child and her pet were following us, so...

109
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,050
Wh-Why did you know and still not stop them?!

110
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,710
An order...

111
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
...wasn't given to do so.

112
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,210
What are you saying, you idiot?!

113
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,140
You should be able to decide something like that by yourself!

114
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,640
Don't you know what could happen if we leave them?

115
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,470
What is it? Oi?!

116
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,660
Does that mean someone's heading here now?

117
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,460
It seems so, doesn't it?

118
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,100
I'M SCARED!!

119
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,710
Hey, shut up!

120
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,950
Oh, it's me.

121
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,750
Listen, Lucci!

122
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,830
Your assignment and first priority is to protect my life!

123
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,230
You got that?!

124
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,370
You have to eliminate every single person who gets in my way!

125
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,790
Going against me is nothing but treason against the World Government!

126
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,460
They deserve to be demolished!

127
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,840
What's with that face?

128
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,850
You don't have time to be worrying about others, Nico Robin.

129
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,480
Hell is right in front of you!

130
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,410
Lucci!

131
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,940
Hurry up and bring her.

132
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,020
Good! I'm back to normal!

133
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,640
Hold on, Robin!

134
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,380
That pigeon bastard!

135
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,630
I'm definitely gonna kick your ass!

136
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,730
Sanji-kun's defeat is...

137
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,780
Well, it's his own fault.

138
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,200
But, what the hell was that?

139
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,610
What's up with this woman?

140
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,610
She's got some guts, doesn't she?

141
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,280
Damn, I have to hurry up and refill my cola.

142
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,270
He zips around so fast for a big guy like him.

143
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,680
Chapapa...

144
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,230
I'm over here.

145
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,940
Seems like you're fast at running away.

146
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,610
Chapapa.

147
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,410
I don't even have to take any of the punches that you're so proud of.

148
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,290
FRANKY TRIANGLE JACKER!!

149
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,740
Chapapa.

150
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,130
I'm not gonna take...

151
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,030
...your stupid sideburns!

152
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,220
Damn you!

153
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,680
Weapons Left!

154
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,730
Damn, I'm almost out of cola.

155
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,340
Gotta hurry to the kitchen!

156
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,980
Wait, you bastard!

157
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,340
Damn it, you dodged it!

158
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,450
You sure are one first class coward!

159
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,360
Chapa...

160
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,070
What did you...?

161
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,190
What's wrong, coward?

162
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,460
You're not running away this time?

163
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,420
You bastard!

164
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,100
You just pissed me off with those words!

165
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,200
Try taking this, my murder strike!

166
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,550
It's faster than the Shigan, and an extremely heavy punch!

167
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,310
Jyugon!

168
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,470
Chapapa...

169
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,650
A tiny punch like that won't work.

170
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,740
Strong

171
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,950
Tekkai!

172
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,490
Hammer!

173
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,380
You have such a weak punch.

174
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,210
Jyugon!

175
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,680
Yours is just a flabby-ass punch.

176
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,370
No, yours is a flabby-ass punch.

177
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,390
Then that makes yours a paper-like punch.

178
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,440
Yours are just norakura pants.

179
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,160
Pants?

180
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,100
That's not a punch!

181
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,520
You're  just pants!

182
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,990
You stupid bra!

183
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,350
Shut up, you sock!

184
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:54,970
Learn your lesson!

185
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,230
Bastard!

186
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,770
Fundoshi!

187
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,000
Fundoshi = Japanese thong for men

188
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,660
Chapapapa~!

189
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,650
Move, you bastard!

190
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,400
Shut up, frog mouth!

191
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,860
This is great! I'm in the kitchen!

192
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,440
They do have one! A huge refrigerator!

193
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,000
That guy...

194
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,420
He's probably got a gorilla Devil Fruit.

195
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,900
Damn it...

196
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,340
Three minutes have already passed.

197
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,440
I used the Rumble Ball too quickly.

198
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,380
What should I do?

199
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,250
Yoyoi!

200
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,010
Withdraw your life from the third world~!

201
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,160
This is the finishing strike~!

202
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,690
Yoyo-!

203
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,180
Bastard!

204
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,110
Great, it's got a lock!

205
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,650
Chapa! Kumadori!

206
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,970
Yeah! I've locked him up!

207
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,070
You bastard!

208
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,350
Oi, wait up you gorilla!

209
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,070
I have business with that refrigerator!

210
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,670
CP9 and the hooligan!

211
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,820
I'm Franky! I'm an ally!

212
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,230
Who's a gorilla?!

213
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,090
You're slow!

214
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,630
Listen up!

215
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,710
Just like Luffy, I haven't forgiven you.

216
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,140
The reason why Usopp left us was...

217
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,680
It was all because of you!

218
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,210
Give me back Usopp!!

219
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,980
But, you guys were just together...

220
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,820
Forget about that for now!

221
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,600
Don't you wanna save Nico Robin?!

222
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,110
I wanna save her!

223
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,920
Robin!

224
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,490
Then get three colas from that fridge and give them to me!

225
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,030
With them I can power up!

226
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,830
I'll finish these assholes off in an instant and take their keys!

227
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,820
What kind of idiot becomes stronger with a cola?

228
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,260
Leave me alone! I do!

229
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,700
You guys...

230
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,850
How long do you plan on doing your stand-up comedy?

231
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,010
And on top of that, you wanna have tea during a fight?

232
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,620
That's impolite!

233
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,770
Jyugon Oogi (Jyugon's Secret)

234
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,980
Hukuro Dataki! (Owl Hits)

235
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,080
Chapapapapapapa!

236
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,700
Beans' Left!

237
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,770
What the hell is that?!

238
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,380
This is bad!

239
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
That's right, he's on our side now.

240
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,750
I better do what he says.

241
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,610
If I open it for an instant and close it, he won't be able to come out.

242
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:45,770
Open!

243
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,100
Yoyoi!

244
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,990
The door has been opened~!

245
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,470
Good!

246
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,890
Franky!

247
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,230
You saved me!

248
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,860
FRESH~!

249
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,120
What the...?

250
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,100
Freshness is the best!

251
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,080
Oyasai punch, go!

252
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,580
Oyasai Punch = Vegetable Punch

253
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,340
Jyugon.

254
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,100
That was vegetable juice!

255
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,920
Who says 'Freshness is the best'?! Damn it!

256
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,470
Give me a cola!

257
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,890
You weren't just thirsty?

258
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,890
Yoyoi!

259
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,490
The door~!

260
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,770
Here!

261
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,970
Thanks!

262
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,060
You've got a good heart, haven't you?

263
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,690
Now...

264
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,590
Here I sit!

265
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,120
The work in the fields is done for the time being.

266
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,290
Let's just cool down and stop the fighting!

267
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,450
Just have some tea!

268
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,300
Tea will give you power!

269
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,570
You freaking dumbass!

270
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,570
He's so amusing.

271
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,880
Oi!

272
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,540
What's up with that 'I wonder what would happen
 if he drank something else?' face?!

273
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,260
Bastard!

274
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,840
There's nothing else, deer!

275
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,690
It's not a matter of how you feel?

276
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,030
I only take cola!

277
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,830
That's cola!

278
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,510
There's no doubt, it's cola!

279
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,230
You're my savior!

280
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,940
I don't know what's going on, but I won't let you do what you want!

281
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,040
Rankyaku

282
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,320
Franky!

283
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,470
SUPER~!!

284
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,400
Chapapa...

285
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,340
What is it?

286
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,420
It's not as if anything will change just because you drank some cola.

287
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,500
Guard yourself.

288
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,650
Chapa!

289
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,570
You idiot!

290
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,550
Are you gonna hit me with another of your weak punches?

291
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,060
Strong Hammer!

292
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,930
Dobeba~!

293
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,780
AMAZING~!!

294
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,580
Sorry about that.

295
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,460
Up until now, my punches were...

296
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,380
...definitely weak, just like you said.

297
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,400
Zoro-kun, any ideas on how to get these handcuffs off?

298
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,220
Yeah.

299
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,640
Let's just do 'rock, paper, scissors', then cut off one of our wrists and...

300
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,810
What the hell are you saying scary things for?!

301
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,810
How could we do that?!

302
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,620
You think so?

303
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,790
Then I have another idea...

304
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,590
I don't wanna hear anymore!

305
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,090
Next time, One Piece: Zoro Bursts With A New Technique!
Zoro's New Sword is Sogeking?

306
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,400
I'm gonna be the Pirate King!

307
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040

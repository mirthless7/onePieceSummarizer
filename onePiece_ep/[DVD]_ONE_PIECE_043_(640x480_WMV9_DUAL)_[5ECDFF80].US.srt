1
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,656
Arlong's eyes have changed!

2
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,825
Inferior human!

3
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,326
How dare you oppose me, a merman!

4
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,079
How dare you oppose me, a merman!

5
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,710
Kiribachi!

6
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:22,475
That room is...

7
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,810
That room is...

8
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,567
You have no where to run now.

9
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,821
This is Arlong Park's top floor.

10
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,865
What's with this-room?

11
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,116
lt's fullofpaper.

12
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:38,825
It's full of paper.

13
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,244
Not just any ordinary paper!

14
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,579
This is the map room.

15
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,540
The room where that girl draws her maps.

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,418
The cartography room.

17
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,549
All of these are sea maps that Nami drew for me.

18
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:50,449
Nami's room...

19
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,802
She's a good woman isn't she?

20
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,680
You won't find anyone who
can draw more accurately.

21
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,682
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

22
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:02,932
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

23
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,183
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

24
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:03,475
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

25
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:03,850
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

26
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,142
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

27
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:04,559
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:04,934
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

29
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:05,185
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

30
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:05,560
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:05,894
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

32
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,144
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

33
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:06,478
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

34
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:06,936
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

35
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,187
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

36
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:07,437
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

37
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:07,520
Her talent exists to serve us mermen forever!

38
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:13,026
Nami you see, is our nakama.

39
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,111
Nakama?

40
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,446
So, just stay out of our way.

41
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:16,863
So, just stay out of our way.

42
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,740
So, just stay out of our way.

43
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,450
You rubber bastard.

44
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,703
What? What's with that look?

45
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:28,249
Nami is...

46
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,920
Our navigator!

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,003
Our navigator!

48
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:42,013
THE END OF THE MARMAN EMPIRE!
NAMI IS MY NAKAMA!

49
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,180
THE END OF THE MARMAN EMPIRE!
NAMI IS MY NAKAMA!

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,222
THE END OF THE MARMAN EMPIRE!
NAMI IS MY NAKAMA!

51
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,357
Oh? You want her to pilot that
crappy little boat of yours, eh?

52
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:57,946
Heh, her talent would only be wasted.

53
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:04,577
Look around you. How many people in the
world can draw such perfect maps?

54
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,373
That girl is a genius.

55
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:20,677
There couldn't be anything more stupid
than wasting such a talent.

56
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,511
For that girl, it's best for her to continue
her work here. Her greatest happiness.

57
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,849
For that girl, it's best for her to continue
her work here. Her greatest happiness.

58
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,269
This pen... It's got blood on it.

59
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:35,358
For me to rule the world, Nami's
maps are a necessity!

60
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,740
She will keep drawing maps for
the sake of my ambition.

61
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,158
She will keep drawing maps for
the sake of my ambition.

62
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:43,324
She will keep drawing maps for
the sake of my ambition.

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,078
And once I have the maps of
all the seas in the world,

64
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,247
no one will be able to stand against me!

65
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,334
The whole world will be mine!

66
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,798
And it all starts right here,
on this island in East Blue.

67
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,387
How could you possibly use her better than I can?

68
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:04,679
How could you possibly use her better than I can?

69
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,514
How could you possibly use her better than I can?

70
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,077
What? l can't move the kiribachi...

71
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,714
Wha..?!

72
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,717
USE?!

73
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,722
What's going on in there?

74
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,059
Damnit! What's happening to you, Luffy-aniki!?

75
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,688
We have no way of knowing what's going on...

76
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,192
Luffy...

77
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,238
What do you take her for?!

78
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,201
Inferior race, but still a smart woman.

79
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:14,040
If the rest of the human race are little
rats, then she's a cunning cat.

80
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,418
And she's a cute one to boot.

81
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,921
Here, she gets food and shelter.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,215
And we buy her all the clothes she wants.

83
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,343
As long as she lives, she will have
nothing to worry about.

84
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,598
As long as she keeps drawing
maps for me, it's all good.

85
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,562
She will forever be my TOOL.

86
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,022
No...

87
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,149
My NAKAMA.

88
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,075
What's that?!

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,038
A desk?

90
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,165
It's a desk!

91
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,838
Oh, it's just a desk...

92
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,592
That scared me, I was afraid that it was
gonna be Luffy-aniki or something...

93
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:06,926
Hey, partner!

94
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,555
Don't you have faith in Luffy-aniki's strength?!

95
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,059
But Johnny, you were surprised too!

96
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,393
Dumbass!

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,773
I was... sure that it was... Arlong, of course...

98
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,859
See? You're so full of it!

99
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,862
What did you say? Like I said...

100
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,324
Luffy?

101
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
Why you! What the hell are you doing?

102
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,664
What's going on?

103
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,583
What's up with all this furniture flying out?

104
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,764
So, from now on, this is your room.

105
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:58,269
Your desk, your pen. Everything
you need is right here.

106
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,692
Stop it!!

107
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,027
The maps!

108
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,989
My sea maps!

109
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,121
You brat! You think you can fool me?

110
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:16,287
You brat! You think you can fool me?

111
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,124
How dare you draw a fake map!

112
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,254
So, You have the time to draw crap like this, huh?

113
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:24,879
So, You have the time to draw crap like this, huh?

114
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,747
So, You have the time to draw crap like this, huh?

115
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,010
If you ever try to cheat me again,

116
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,301
If you ever try to cheat me again,

117
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:30,552
If you ever try to cheat me again,

118
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:35,373
If you ever try to cheat me again,

119
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,408
Just like I did this one!

120
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,266
Bastard! It took her eight years to draw these!

121
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,519
And you're destroying them! Along with my ambition!

122
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,534
Bellemere-san...

123
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,870
Nojiko...

124
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,628
They're fighting so brutally.

125
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,131
Indeed... a fight to the death.

126
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,424
No kidding...

127
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,059
Thank you...

128
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,230
You've gone too far, you rubber bastard!

129
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,734
I don't give a crap how great you mermen are...

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,911
Or what happens to your stupid maps!

131
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:16,382
I may not understand the story around this...

132
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,912
But now, I know what I've gotta do to help her!

133
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,687
It's this room. I can't let it exist.

134
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,332
This room she doesn't want to be in.

135
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,876
I'LL DESTROY IT ALL.

136
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,219
GOMU GOMU NO...

137
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:36,511
GOMU GOMU NO...

138
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,095
GOMU GOMU NO...

139
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,096
GOMU GOMU NO...

140
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,807
Impossible!

141
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,770
Arlong Park will never be destroyed
by the likes of you.

142
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,942
SHARK ON...

143
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:51,276
HAGURUMA!
(Shark on Gear!)

144
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,986
...ONO!
(Axe!)

145
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,616
Look! That last attack is causing Arlong Park to...

146
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,827
No way! It's collapsing!

147
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,995
Everyone, run!

148
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,873
Nami-aneki, hurry!

149
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,249
But Luffy's still in there!

150
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:48,958
ANEKI!

151
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,418
But Luffy... Luffy is!

152
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,527
LUFFY!!!

153
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:04,324
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

154
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:11,289
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

155
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:20,548
Now I finally know how to help her!

156
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:22,342
Now I finally know how to help her!

157
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:25,553
It's this room. l can't let it exist.

158
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:26,721
This room she doesn't want to be In.

159
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:27,013
This room she doesn't want to be In.

160
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:27,263
This room she doesn't want to be in.

161
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,598
This room she doesn't want to be In.

162
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:31,935
l'LL DESTROY IT ALLI

163
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,234
LUFFY!!!

164
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,289
Luffy...

165
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,342
Luffy...

166
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:23,862
Ouch! What the hell?! Damned noisy...

167
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,160
Luffy?

168
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,843
Arlong Park is... demolished!

169
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:48,595
Aniki...

170
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:52,098
What happened inside?

171
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,729
Who won?

172
00:13:58,146 --> 00:13:59,564
It all happened so quickly.

173
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,149
Could he...?

174
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:03,818
Luffy...

175
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,209
LUFFY!

176
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:22,712
A-NI-KIIII!!

177
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:34,390
Is he okay?

178
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,940
NAMI!!

179
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,866
YOU ARE

180
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:54,244
MY NAKAMA!!!

181
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,851
He won?!

182
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,395
He won!

183
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:22,313
We won!

184
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,399
WE WON!!

185
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,361
Arlong Park has fallen!

186
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:31,823
Isn't it great, Onee-san?

187
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:33,450
Gen-san!

188
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,869
Are we... Are we dreaming?

189
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,954
I can't believe this day has finally come...

190
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:55,597
You did it, Luffy! You deserve the praise!

191
00:15:55,597 --> 00:16:01,019
But if you let me have some, I'd really appreciate it!

192
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,855
Man, you had me worried there for a bit.

193
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:09,110
Be quicker next time, you bastard.

194
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,474
Awesome!

195
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,658
That's enough, scumbags!

196
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,326
Not him!

197
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,248
Well, this must be my lucky day! Nice work.

198
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:06,000
I enjoyed the show,

199
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:07,502
but I never would've thought...

200
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:13,842
that these mermen would be defeated
by the likes of you silly pirates.

201
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:22,100
But thanks to you, Arlong's bounty, as well
as all of Arlong Park's riches, will be mine.

202
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,685
Everyone, put down your weapons!

203
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,107
I, Captain Nezumi, of the Marine's 16th Battalion,
will be taking over from here~!

204
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,285
Zoro!

205
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:36,364
Don't spoil the mood when people
are trying to celebrate.

206
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:47,625
I-If you dare hit me just one more
time, I won't let you live...

207
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,252
You're still talking?

208
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,091
This is for shooting Nojiko...

209
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:59,721
and for messing up Bellemere-san's tangerine grove.

210
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,351
Captain!

211
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:12,192
Thanks Nami. That was satisfying.

212
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:15,069
And there's a thousand more
where that came from, jerk!

213
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,496
Now. You guys will take care of
cleaning up after the mermen,

214
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,290
and help reconstruct Gosa Village.

215
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:30,835
But you will not touch even the slightest
bit of the mermen's riches!

216
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:32,796
They belong to the people of this island.

217
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:33,630
Understand?

218
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,509
Ow, ow! I'll do as you say...

219
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,677
And one more thing...

220
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:41,721
GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY!

221
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,598
I'll give it back, honestly.

222
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,101
I don't want it anymore...

223
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,357
This won't be forgotten, you lousy pirates!

224
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,527
Straw Hat guy! The name's Luffy, right?

225
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:58,113
You're the captain, aren't you? Don't forget this!

226
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:01,491
You're gonna be big, after messing with me!

227
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,369
Too late for amends now! I'll make you sorry!

228
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,038
Mark my wooords!!

229
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,499
He said we're gonna be big.

230
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,253
How'd he know I was gonna be the Pirate King?

231
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:16,131
He wasn't talking about that, you numbskull.

232
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,715
What do we do now?!

233
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,759
If we become notorious, what'll happen to us?

234
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,095
What'll do we do? Huh? Huh?!

235
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:23,346
Hey, everyone!

236
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,765
We can't just celebrate this by ourselves!

237
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,519
Carry the news to the whole island!

238
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,855
YEAH!

239
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:32,939
Arlong Park has...

240
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,817
Arlong Park has fallen!

241
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,298
Isn't it great, Nami?

242
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,428
Who would've thought that
we'd be saved by pirates?

243
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,805
What's the world coming to?

244
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:12,562
Greetings, you inferior humans! Listen up!

245
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:12,729
Greetings, you inferior humans! Listen up!

246
00:20:12,854 --> 00:20:15,398
From now on, this village, no..

247
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:17,859
This island belongs to me!

248
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,328
Gen-san, help me!

249
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:28,620
Get your filthy hands off those kids!

250
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:40,632
T-That tattoo is Arlong's mark!

251
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:41,216
T-That tattoo is Arlong's mark!

252
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:42,425
T-That tattoo is Arlong's mark!

253
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:44,677
Why did you?I

254
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,389
That's enough.

255
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,060
You've been carrying the burden
of our lives for so long.

256
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,729
You've fought well.

257
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,375
Then it went "Kaboom!"

258
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,835
We did well in the end, right?

259
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:29,889
At long last, Bellemere's soul can
ascend to Heaven, in peace.

260
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,441
Hello! Hellooo?!

261
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,526
Yes, Marine Headquarters here.

262
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,404
Marine Headquarters, hello?

263
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:47,824
This is the Marine's 16th Battalion Captain Nezumi!

264
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:50,452
Marine code #OO733!

265
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,245
I have a report to make!

266
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,914
No need to yell. We can hear you.

267
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:55,832
Listen up!

268
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:58,710
There's a pirate who wears a straw hat, called Luffy!

269
00:21:59,002 --> 00:21:59,794
Listen up!

270
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:02,964
There's a pirate who wears a straw hat, called Luffy!

271
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:07,427
He and his four accomplices are
all against the government!!

272
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:11,806
He and his four accomplices are
all against the government!!

273
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:13,433
Luffy...

274
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,189
They were able to crumble Arlong Park and defeat
the fearsome Arlong and his mermen!

275
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:20,815
We must beware of them!

276
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:25,445
I wish to place a heavy bounty on the head
of their captain, ''Straw Hat Luffy''!

277
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:26,863
I'm sending his picture.

278
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:27,906
Roger.

279
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,538
What's this? Couldn't you find a better picture?

280
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,332
Not really, this is all we got.

281
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:40,084
The authenticity of the bounty will be reviewed later.

282
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:42,295
After we send it to the higher-ups.

283
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,049
You got it?! He is a villainous pirate!

284
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,592
I want him DEAD OR ALIVE!

285
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:52,305
I WANT A HIGH BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD!!

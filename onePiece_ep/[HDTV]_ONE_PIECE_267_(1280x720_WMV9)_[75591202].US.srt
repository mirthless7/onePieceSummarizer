1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,960
One Piece Treasure Sweepstakes! The first letter is... this!

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,220
The way to win will be explained at the end of the show!

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,530
I won't let any of you pass through this door!

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,550
The men of the Franky Family were trying to open the way, having to pass by the two giant gatekeepers who suddently appeared at the Main Island Gate, Oimo and Kaashii.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,460
Timber Hitch Tug

6
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,320
Paulie and Zambai reversed the situation and were about to succeed in forcing the gate open.

7
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:57,680
On the other side, Luffy who already passed the Main Island Front Gate was unavoidably facing retardement from the enourmous amount of military force there.

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,540
Five people? You mistook it for only five people?

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,060
Geez, can't you even report properly?

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,470
Five hundred people...

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,500
Lucci's party was taking Franky and Robin in the Judiciary tower where Spandam was waiting.

12
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,330
It's great you returned!

13
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,430
Lucci

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,340
Kaku

15
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,380
Blueno

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,510
Kalifa

17
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,540
It's sexual harassment.

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,030
Just because I said your name?

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,000
You guys did a really good job on your five years mission.

20
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:49,130
That's right! It's not like a reward for this job but I have something to give you.

21
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,480
Mah, we'll put that aside from now.

22
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,030
For now, let me meet with them.

23
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,950
With the whole world's hope.

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,340
And the Straw Hat's party boarding the Rocketman was making its preparations to break in.

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,260
Guys, the time has come!

26
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,610
It's getting late, how about we go?

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,580
Samurai-man! I leave that barrier to you!

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,730
I'll take care of it.

29
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,590
Hurry up and enter!

30
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,500
You too!

31
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,210
Chapapa... PA!

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,150
This couldn't make me happier!

33
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,650
Good job on surviving that incident eight years ago,

34
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,510
Cutty Flam.

35
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,930
And the woman the whole world considers a threat,

36
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,740
Nico Robin.

37
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,950
Open the escape road! 
The Rocketman flying through the sky!

38
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,400
I feel great!

39
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:40,850
It's too bad, the people of the world may still not know at what point our achievements today were glorious.

40
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,510
As a matter of fact, it may still take a couple of years until those events are known.

41
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,390
If you ask me, the justice of those old men is still too soft!

42
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,010
You can't achieve your goals without any sacrifice!

43
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,100
We are working the best we can to atteint peace for all humanity

44
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,140
It's okay to kill those fools who hinder our work, as sacrifices for the grand peace.

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,960
Everyone should just give us what we demand obediently, you giant...

46
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,220
As outlaws for the Justice, it's evident they should be killed!

47
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,830
Evident, evident!

48
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,050
I'm getting pissed off! Tom-san threw his life away to protect the plans!

49
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,150
Because idiots like you exist!

50
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,950
What are you doing!? Help me guys!

51
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,060
Kumadori!

52
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,790
Yoyoi!

53
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you saying?

54
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,680
Hurry to save me, oi!

55
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,600
Saa, saa, saa!

56
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:10,850
Yoi!

57
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,440
Sorry...! No need to thank me, chief Spandam.

58
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,410
Gomu gomu no gatling gun

59
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,120
Gomu gomu no muchi (whip)

60
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,670
oogama (giant sickle)

61
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,740
kane (bell)

62
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,210
tonkachi (hammer)

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,700
bazooka

64
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,560
Gomu gomu no stamp

65
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,600
Message from the Main Island to the chief! Chief Spandam? I request an answer!

66
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,820
It's no good, it's not getting through...!

67
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,370
Maybe isn't the reciever connected again?

68
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,980
Again?

69
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,020
Geez, at such an important time too..!

70
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,480
Hey, where did Straw Hat disappear to?

71
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,120
Just under you!

72
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,730
Eh? Under?

73
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,750
Attack all at once!

74
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,750
He's down there!

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,240
Shit, got cornered!

76
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,190
Gomu gomu no kazan (volcano)

77
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,010
The wall is... The wall is falling!

78
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,230
Run away!

79
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,220
Gomu gomu no

80
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,140
gatling gun

81
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,200
It's dangerous!

82
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,680
Chief Spandam, I request an answer! Give us your orders, Straw Hat Luffy won't stop!

83
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,160
Straw Hat Luffy is heading toward the courthouse!

84
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
Harden our defences, hurry!

85
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,030
Shut up!

86
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
What's this fuss all about?

87
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,980
I just woke up!

88
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,110
Judge!

89
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,470
Enies Lobby's presiding judge: 
3 headed Baskerville


Right! No need to hide it, I am Enies Lobby's presiding judge!

90
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,210
I am the one who writes with the left hand, Left-Baskerville!

91
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,720
I am the one who writes with the right hand, Right-Baskerville!

92
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,280
And me in the center, I'm Center-Freeway!

93
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,580
Why's that!?

94
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,050
J-Judge! There is a pirate alone making a mess in the Main Island.

95
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,320
It seems we can't get in touch with Chief Spandam. Please take commandment in his place!

96
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,720
A pirate, huh? A pirate is guilty!

97
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,040
Stop saying such things, let him be innocent!

98
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,780
Then I'll take the neutral part.

99
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,980
DEATH SENTENCE!

100
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,050
Why's that!?

101
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,020
We are in trouble! Judge! We had a report from the Main Island Gate that Kaashi was down because of the Straw Hat's nakamas and that Oimo won't last long too!

102
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,980
What? The Gate musn't be breached!

103
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,150
Order 100 Houbantais to rush to the Main Island!

104
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,540
Shit! The promised 5 minutes is over!

105
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,350
This is bad... Hurry up and open the way for the Rocketman!

106
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,790
I won't let you get to this gate!

107
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,340
We opened the gate's lock!

108
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
You just need to push it so it opens!

109
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,160
Shit!

110
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,000
Yosh, well done! Let's go!

111
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,290
Don't touch that door!

112
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,280
Rope Action

113
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,110
Top Knot

114
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,290
There!

115
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,760
Awesome! As expected from a Galley-La foreman!

116
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,650
What are you trying with such a rope...?

117
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,030
Franky Familly, pull!

118
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,850
Leave it to us! Let's go, Sodome and Gommorha! Seize the rope!

119
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,310
Let's charge in this way!

120
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,660
W-wait a sec! I'm getting dizzy...!

121
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,560
Push the gate!

122
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,980
The door is...!

123
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,580
The door is opening!

124
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,750
What about Oimo!?

125
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,340
Just a little more...

126
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,250
We breached the gate!

127
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,100
Oi, oi!

128
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,630
Oi...

129
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,170
The... The seatrain?

130
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,590
What is this about?

131
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,240
What!? It's charging directly at us!

132
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,960
No way! It can't pass the fence!

133
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,040
Hurry up! We must stop them!

134
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,990
Close the door!

135
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,230
Oi, baa-san

136
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,710
Ah, what is it?

137
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,830
Changement in the plan! Give me as much speed as you can!

138
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,990
Roger!

139
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,290
Roger!

140
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,070
Guys, seems like there's a modification in our plan. Samurai-man is telling you to hold firmly onto something in the car.

141
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,300
So he said!

142
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,900
To hold firmly onto something?

143
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:11,890
Why?

144
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,360
Hey, stupid swordman! Did something happen?

145
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,330
The Main Gate was closed.

146
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,970
What did you say!?

147
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,250
This is bad, we'll really crush in there!

148
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,980
What do we do? What do we do? WHAT DO WE DO!?

149
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,710
We can't dodge it! We'll get killed!

150
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,620
It's unnecessary to worry. There's a way.

151
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,360
As expected from Zoro!

152
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,360
Break that fence down, frog!

153
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,710
Don't tell me...! We'll run over the fence this way!

154
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,390
THAT CAN'T BE TRUE!

155
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,450
The Seatrain...

156
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,310
...is flying!

157
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,670
We'll die!

158
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,990
Are we going to die?

159
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,150
Nami-san! Hurry to get in my chest!

160
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,130
Don't you think I have enough problems like this, idiot!?

161
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,390
Zoro! You must be thinking about a plan, right!?

162
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,230
Leave it...

163
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,690
To luck.

164
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,710
Leave it to luck!?

165
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,370
Ahh! Oimo was defeated!

166
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,940
Y-you guys are.. From the Straw Hat crew?

167
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,970
THAT'S RIGHT!

168
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,760
Is that so!?

169
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,770
That kind of thing doesn't matter at all.

170
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,120
We must hurry to advance further in.

171
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,100
All right! Guys! All we need to do now is to advance as far as we can!

172
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah!

173
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,950
Paulie!

174
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,820
Shit!

175
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,070
Who are you?

176
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:16,780
We are Enies Lobby first class guards, the Hou no Banken Butai also shortened as Houbantai!

177
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,760
Under Judge Baskerville's orders, we'll have you go through death punishment!

178
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,620
Shit! They keep coming one after the other, hindering us!

179
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,770
Oimo! What are you doing, allowing such pirates to pass through the gate! What's happening with you?

180
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,350
Ouch!

181
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,610
I passed out...

182
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,410
Damn! He is back on his feets!

183
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,700
I won't forgive you... I will absolutly not forgive you!

184
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,620
What... The Rocketman just... from the sky!

185
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,610
We didn't even need to open the gates!

186
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,240
W-What happened!?

187
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,650
Are they okay after such a landing?

188
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,360
They aren't coming out...

189
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,260
Oi, what's wrong!?

190
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,730
What are those two!?

191
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,850
Ah... Should we have greeted them first?

192
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,570
Don't be absurd. As if we'd need to.

193
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,310
It's Roronoa and the others!

194
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,360
We were waiting!

195
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,750
It went as I ordered...

196
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,900
For real?

197
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,140
Gomu gomu no storm

198
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,400
He went there!

199
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,880
Shit! Don't let him escape!

200
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,110
Wait!

201
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,470
We finally cornered you!

202
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,470
You don't have anywhere to run now!

203
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,010
All of you...!

204
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,060
DON'T GET IN MY WAY!

205
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,000
Why are there so many enemies out there!?

206
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,110
Isn't it a good thing? It'll let us get some exercise too!

207
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,240
Next time, One Piece: Catch up with Luffy, the Straw Hats all-out war.

208
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,180
I'll become the pirate king!

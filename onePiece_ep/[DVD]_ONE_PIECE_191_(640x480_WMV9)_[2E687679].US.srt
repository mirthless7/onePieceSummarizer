1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,090
RAIGOU

2
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,599
Angel Island…

3
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,130
was destroyed…

4
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,640
The ancestor of Papi Head-of-Diamond
was not a liar.

5
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,399
Then…

6
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,459
Then this Papi and monkeys in
low must know the truth!

7
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,820
The Gold City is in the sky!

8
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,249
I cannot let Eneru take it!

9
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,250
The sound of this enormous bell will be enough
powerful to be heard of anywhere!

10
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,170
It is for that I go
to make sound the Gold Bell!

11
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,560
Cut down Giant Jack!
The ultimate hope of escape

12
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,679
Even the door of the Paradise…

13
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,220
was destroyed instantaneously.

14
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,149
Isn't Angel Island there any more?

15
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,859
But where we will live?

16
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,569
For the moment, all that we can make, it is to join Cloud End and to flee towards the Blue Sea.

17
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,779
There are not an other choice.

18
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,850
But…

19
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,150
People are still
wedged on the Sea of Opal!

20
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,239
Nothing for them can!

21
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,699
Without Milky Road,

22
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,409
How could we go down
with the boats on the White Sea?

23
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,950
Then one will give up them?!

24
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,350
How is this possible?

25
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,140
Sea of Opal…

26
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,900
Skypiea disappears…

27
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,640
Then here.

28
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,680
Splendid!

29
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,239
Here what made the pride
large city of Shandora…

30
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,690
The Large Belfry!

31
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,119
Splendid!

32
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,619
That is appropriate to me perfectly,
with me Very Powerful God.

33
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,250
It is the bell which sounded it
beginning of these 400 years of war.

34
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,919
But…

35
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,790
They fought so much, then
that soon, all will disappear.

36
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,720
All their efforts will be vain.

37
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,440
Luffy, one cannot reach it!

38
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,150
The arch of Eneru floats close to this cloud.

39
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,669
Luffy…

40
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,750
Eneru had to find
Gold bell now.

41
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,969
Even by lengthening your arms,
you will not reach it from here.

42
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,309
If it seizes some,

43
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,969
I will take it again to him!

44
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,790
I borrow it to you!

45
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,280
It is too distant
top of bean.

46
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,350
What can we make?

47
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,030
How could one reach it?

48
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,740
The guy!

49
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,330
None among you will escape from it!

50
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,500
Neither you, nor those of which I
still perceive the bass voices!

51
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,500
It is that.

52
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,300
They are not yet escaped.

53
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,510
The others are still in bottom!

54
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,789
Made blunder!

55
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,999
Another trick is falling!

56
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,770
What?

57
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,570
With cover!

58
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,650
A sheet?

59
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,410
Hein?

60
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,750
There is something of writing above.

61
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,620
A message!

62
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,460
It is on behalf of Luffy and Nami!

63
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,580
Does that say what?

64
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,260
Cut down giant bean…

65
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,189
towards the West.

66
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,770
WHAT?!

67
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,279
And then…

68
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,050
to what that will be useful?

69
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,739
He.

70
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,720
Where is the West?

71
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,110
He, be serious for you?!

72
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,860
Where is the West?

73
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,120
I think that the arch of Eneru
is in this direction.

74
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,899
All my objectives were achieved!

75
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,800
All that it remains…

76
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:16,750
it is to use this Raigou to destroy this country and Cumuloregalis then to leave for Fairy Vearth.

77
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,680
I am almost sad of me to separate some!

78
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,050
Eneru!

79
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,620
What a demon!

80
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,549
It is still…

81
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,530
larger than presently!

82
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,670
There is no more no means…

83
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,510
to escape from this island!

84
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,760
Good-bye, Skypiea!

85
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,729
It is even larger than the other!

86
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,869
Dumb!

87
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,359
You are right.

88
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,219
Considering it found the Gold Bell,

89
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,819
this country is not useful to him any more with nothing.

90
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,310
One sees clearly in his play.

91
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,699
If he believes that one goes
to let slip by with,

92
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,860
it will have a surprise!

93
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,820
Won't Nami, you flee?

94
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,829
How can you say that now?

95
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,290
You want to make sound the bell, not?

96
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,629
Ouais!

97
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,530
I will sound it!

98
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,049
Good, and as you do not know
not to lead Waver.

99
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,849
If I give up you there, you go
to continue to try to climb.

100
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,710
I can take you along with me
and to spin you a knack.

101
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,920
But!

102
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,220
You must promise to me
how I will remain in life!

103
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,149
Ok, not of problem!

104
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,300
Let us do it!

105
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,239
Ca will be played little.

106
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,010
And one will not be entitled to the error.

107
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,120
I hope that the others
will have had the message.

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,910
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

109
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,310
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

110
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,009
They will run along bean…

111
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,880
and to cross while jumping towards the arch?!

112
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,950
I see that.

113
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,719
They lost the head.

114
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,519
Of agreement, then goes up to stop them.

115
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,170
How if I of be able!

116
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,099
In any event,

117
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,970
insane or not, it is our only chance!

118
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,899
Q-Q-what
?!

119
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,849
Length-nose-kun
!

120
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,550
They is good, I have it!

121
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,319
If one remains here, one goes
to fall into the ruins!

122
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,899
You move away from bean!

123
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,780
Will run towards the dry land!

124
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,199
I will do it!

125
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,450
I must just cut down
is the bean, it that?

126
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,610
He!

127
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,920
The only ones with being able to reach Eneru
before it launches this trick…

128
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,379
on all the celestial island…

129
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,289
He, Zoro!

130
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,290
it is them!

131
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,549
Even with two fingers of death,

132
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,849
you continue you
to discuss and to run.

133
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,019
You still did not include/understand?

134
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,389
While penetrating on these grounds
during the Play of Survival,

135
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,930
Your destinies are
dissipated like smoke.

136
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,229
II it goes
to make?!

137
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,569
Go!

138
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,700
You are the only one who can cut down it!

139
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,280
You ace finished with your whores of holes?!

140
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,410
Ouais, it cut out it!

141
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,240
Zoro!

142
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Poor wretch maggot.

143
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,279
SHIT!!!!

144
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,359
Mr.-MR.-but, it
cut out!

145
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,010
It cut out it!

146
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
Oh not…

147
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,850
Look at!

148
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,480
It does not fall!

149
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,390
But it cut it!

150
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,249
This filth is solid!

151
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,950
It is really a plant?

152
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,990
It had only what it deserves.

153
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,950
Foreigners, you came to line
your nose in our business.

154
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,129
Wiper!

155
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,019
You cannot!

156
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,740
The calm one!

157
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,970
This bell incarnates the will of
Karugara and it is with us to sound it!

158
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,969
Why Straw hat
should make it sound?!

159
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,559
Let it make, Robin!

160
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,679
In any event, it will not be able
pas l' to stop with its wounds.

161
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,439
Now, all is owed
to make to cut down this bean!

162
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,130
Luffy and Nami count on us!

163
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,770
Zoro already cut out us half.

164
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,480
This entire trick must
to start to waver.

165
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,850
With the explosions mortals
of my Dance of Kayakuboshi,

166
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
This thing will howl of
pain while being crushed on the ground!

167
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,580
I am the showpiece
of this crew of pirates!

168
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,580
Robin, deals with
your comrades with ground!

169
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,290
[Note:Mochi:rice puddings]

170
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,240
With the attack!

171
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,260
400 years ago…

172
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,729
An explorer of the Blue Sea…

173
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,390
lied while affirming
to have seen the Gold City.

174
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,859
Its kingdom made fun of him.

175
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,479
But its descendants
believed in its words…

176
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,490
and continue to seek
Cité d'Or in the Blue Sea.

177
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,959
To sound the Gold Bell…

178
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,450
their will state that
Cité d'Or is in the sky.

179
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,240
Straw hat and it
boy divide this opinion.

180
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,200
[Note:Gunpowder star]

181
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,920
Don't a valid reason, you believe?

182
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,370
It is rather romantic.

183
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,810
In spite of the situation, using of its last
chance of survival, it does not give up.

184
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,639
It is as if it had lost the head.

185
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,339
hissatsu kayaku boshi

186
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,639
[Note:Star mortal
of gunpowder]

187
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,099
[Note:Rubber band]

188
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,359
dobikkuri kayaku boshi

189
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,760
[Note:Surprised star
of gunpowder]

190
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,220
And…

191
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,440
which is the name of its descendant?

192
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,740
Montblanc Cricket.

193
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,570
And its ancestor of 400 years ago…

194
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,789
Did this ancestor name himself…

195
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,990
Norland?

196
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,030
Wiper?

197
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,630
That there is,
Wiper?

198
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,429
This would be…

199
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,290
a miracle?

200
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,180
Large Karugara Warrior!

201
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,309
Good…

202
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,109
It is time to proclaim
until the fine bottom of the skies, Nora!

203
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,739
We will sound the bell
that you like so much to hear…

204
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,980
so that Norland can hear it!

205
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,580
It is what?

206
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,220
It was what?

207
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,680
Even this large tremor does not have
not succeeded in reversing it!

208
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,609
Blasted plant!

209
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,729
I will launch you one
triple shooting which goes…

210
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,670
Release.

211
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,890
Karugara…

212
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,570
The descendant of your friend…

213
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,110
always waits…

214
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,280
to intend to sound the Gold Bell.

215
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,950
These people are good!

216
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,240
Reject

217
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,969
But it was what that?!

218
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,170
Wiper!

219
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,179
What a madness!

220
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,260
Reject Dial!

221
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,310
NOW TOMB, GIANT JACK!

222
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,660
IT COLLAPSES!

223
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,289
It is reversed!

224
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,690
Go up, Luffy!

225
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,070
Give all that you ace!

226
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,669
To be honest,

227
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,840
I never led it
Jet Dial at full speed.

228
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,179
Because…

229
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,170
It is so powerful that
I have evil to control it.

230
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,679
Then it is the occasion to see that!

231
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,960
OK!

232
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,019
It left, Luffy!

233
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,880
Ouais!

234
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,840
It collapses!

235
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,319
Look at!

236
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,020
That it occurs
over there?

237
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,949
Go, Luffy!

238
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,520
Nami!

239
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,900
If the celestial island is destroyed,

240
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,610
We will not be able
to sound the Gold Bell!

241
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,420
It should be sounded so that Papi
Does cricket can hear it, hein?

242
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,000
Now, sink
towards the arch of Eneru!

243
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,259
GO!

244
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,259
ALL RESTS ON YOU!

245
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,240
Go!

246
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,229
Let us go, go…

247
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,480
Why they do not wait
what my Raigou is ready?

248
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,140
That these mortals are impertinent.

249
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,520
They do not leave me the choice.

250
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,619
A trick prepares!

251
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,929
Forget that!

252
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,610
I can divert all
what it launches us!

253
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,740
Even not badly! Be bad for you!

254
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,009
To try like that to reach me…

255
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,679
is of a stupidity without equal!

256
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,410
You will include/understand your silly thing.

257
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,210
MAMARAGAN

258
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,710
It tests…

259
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,430
to collapse bean
by destroying the base.

260
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,069
Do something, Nami!

261
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,489
You want that I do what?!

262
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,560
One is already climbing!

263
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,659
Without the ground which supports bean,

264
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,520
N will never go rather high!

265
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,690
One will not reach Eneru!

266
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,410
The flashes strike any Upper Yard!

267
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,139
Luffy!

268
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,790
Nami!

269
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,729
Even if my flashes
do not have any effect on you,

270
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,560
that is not used for nothing if you
donot can reach me!

271
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,609
Fall down and awaits the end of my Raigou,

272
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,440
Man rubber!

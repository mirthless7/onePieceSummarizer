1
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,950
Finally I found them

2
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,750
those which have of so beautiful memories.

3
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, hello.

4
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,850
What is what there is?

5
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,320
Qu… which are you?

6
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,230
Hein?

7
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:30,450
I lost it? It was concealed to me?

8
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:30,450
Be to you which you?

9
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,360
Uhmm… I can more nothing swallow…

10
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,350
Still!

11
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,320
Ahaa… ah… ah… aaah!!

12
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,210
Where am I…? And then… which is these guy…?

13
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,970
Eh you!!

14
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,920
Or… yes…

15
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,680
You include/understand something you?

16
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,550
Hein?

17
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,140
Me, I am called Sanji and I am the second Master cock of ship-restaurant BARATIE.

18
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,140
It however seems to me that yesterday, I went to lay down me in my room…

19
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,690
And when I awoke this morning, I found myself with you,

20
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,980
in a place which I do not even know….

21
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,140
You know why, you??

22
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,960
Ah… euh… euuuhhh…

23
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,900
Ah? It is you who saved me?

24
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,950
Saved??

25
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,550
Me I am Luffy, I left my Fushia village to take the sea.

26
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,180
But I found myself in a swirl

27
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,830
I hid in barrels but by turn I disappeared

28
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,680
and… when I realized some, I was here.

29
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,390
I thought just that it was you who had saved me.

30
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,570
Qu… that is what that want to say?

31
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,300
Me also, after having discussed with Kaya.

32
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,230
I played with the children and I returned to lie down.

33
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,500
But I do not remember absolutely more continuation…

34
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,230
Is this similar for them too?

35
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,250
And… you you know something?

36
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,990
Hein?

37
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,460
Do you know why we are in such a place?

38
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,770
I include/understand anything but they have me the odd air,

39
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,650
I will try to deceive them…

40
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,470
OK… I will say it to you…

41
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,200
after all it is normal that you did not remember any more what occurred yesterday.

42
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,430
Since you were made attack by the Large Legendary Whale.

43
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,530
A large legendary whale??

44
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,860
Eh yes, this whale had swallowed you.

45
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,020
But I fought it to save you.

46
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,020
Good Ah… I did not know

47
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,110
Thank you.

48
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,330
Who are you?

49
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,040
Good question!

50
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,590
I am the chief of the troops of pirates who reign as a Master on any Eastblue.

51
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,190
Everyone respects me and calls me Capitaine Usopp!

52
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,960
Wooow! Usopp captain!

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,970
You know?

54
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,300
Not! At all!

55
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,810
He He… pay attention so that you say.

56
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,560
There is more than 8000 men in my crew…

57
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,030
QUOIIIIII?!!

58
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,580
More than 8000??!!

59
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,780
Ah… euh… yes… and in more you also you belong to my crew since yesterday.

60
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,460
It is true?

61
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,260
They is false…

62
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,620
Oups… It included/understood.

63
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,440
You see… You ace known as “it included/understood”.

64
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,180
Aarghh, zut… I said “it included/understood”!

65
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,170
You are somebody of intelligent.

66
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,470
Hahahahah… Be to you funny you…

67
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,230
Eh you! Do not make fun of me!

68
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,510
I am a proud man! Me!

69
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,030
This is why everyone calls me Usopp To trust….

70
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,290
What? What is what take to you?

71
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,400
R… nothing… I have the impression to have already lived that…

72
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,560
Me also….

73
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,380
I have enough of it!

74
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,790
Hiiii!

75
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,880
For the moment let us make like that…

76
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,720
Initially it is necessary that one eats

77
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,140
One cannot reflect the empty belly well.

78
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,700
Puffs out it!?

79
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,040
Ah yes… you said that you were a Master cock…

80
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,700
and of first class.

81
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,760
If we are on a boat, there must be provisions.

82
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,960
A boat?

83
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,520
Eh… wait a little! And you, be to you who finally?

84
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,090
Me? I am the future Lord of the Pirates!

85
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,880
Hein?

86
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,150
Eh Ben… it is old this ship…

87
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,320
Eh look at! an island!

88
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,270
Where is what one can be well?

89
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,760
There is a serious problem!

90
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
The navigatrice has…

91
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,000
Uhm? It is which they?

92
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,570
They form also part of your crew?

93
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,850
Euh… of course!

94
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,530
You also, you lost the memory?

95
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,080
Ah I include/understand now why the papillons de nuit seek the light…

96
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,910
The human ones also cannot resist what shines.

97
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,530
Are beautiful young people young ladies which your names?

98
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,070
If you are free this evening we let us can dine together?

99
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,660
Ahahaha! It is funny this type.

100
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,530
It completely changed attitude…

101
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,670
Eh! It is which them?

102
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,690
Where am I?

103
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,580
And…

104
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,790
You were mistaken in direction… not?

105
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,560
It is what that?

106
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,820
It is a stag…

107
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,350
Your dirty mouth human!

108
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,640
I am a reindeer!!

109
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,080
He spoke!

110
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,430
Eh let us catch it!

111
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,940
Eh… stops it is odd this trick!!

112
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
Hey you! Helps us too!

113
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,100
I do not want! Eh! Do not come here!

114
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,570
Euh… by or will I begin the explanation…?

117
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,030
Good… Everyone listen to me….

118
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,850
We are with…

119
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,280
What is what you ace known as?

120
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,930
I said that we were currently on GrandLine.

121
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,470
You forgot that too??

122
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
It is true?

123
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,490
Eh! Why are content for you?!

124
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,100
It is said that GrandLine is a sea or there is full with monsters!

125
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,020
If it is said to you that you are in a similar place, normally you should be afraid!

126
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,070
But Ca does not change anything a normal sea…

127
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,990
Be sour for you that one is on GrandLine??

128
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,940
Navigatrice…

129
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,770
Hein? It is of me that it acts?

130
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,850
Is what you recognize this bracelet with your wrist?

131
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,370
Hein?

132
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,840
What is what it is??

133
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,450
Ca is called Logpose.

134
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,890
In this sea one cannot thus use compass it is necessary to use attraction magnetic close islands to advance.

135
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,190
And this tool makes it possible to measure the intensity of this attraction.

136
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,420
To cross GrandLine, it is essential.

137
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,050
To the fact Miss, me I must turn over in my restaurant in Eastblue.

138
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,540
But would have an good idea for that?

139
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,530
I advise you to drop.

140
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:23,700
That already made a good end of time that one is in this sea, and if you try to only set out again it is suicidal.

141
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,880
We were spirit to advance as Logpose indicated it.

142
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,000
And we arrived on this island surrounded by coral reef.

143
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,720
I cannot believe you!

144
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,120
Moreover why do I travel with people like Ca?

145
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,790
Look at…

146
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,280
Eh it is a flag of pirate.

147
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,310
What?? It is a ship of pirate??

148
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,540
Hein? Ah yes… it is the ship of large Usopp.

149
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,360
Good Ah!

150
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,080
But… Usopp captain.

151
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,910
This tête de mort does a straw hat not wear?

152
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,750
Ahh? Ah yes… thus Ca wants to say that this hat has me.

153
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,850
Eh! How is what you do! Return it to me!!

154
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,630
Ouwatatata!!

155
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,230
Do not touch has my straw hat!!

156
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,150
If you start again I you boot the bottom!!

157
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,470
But… you do not have say that you did not remember any more anything?

158
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,400
I will always remember that! It is my treasure!

159
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,590
Treasury?

160
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,210
When I was kid I received this invaluable treasure of a friend.

161
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,210
I swore on this hat that I will seek companions to become a pirate.

162
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:39,740
Hum!

163
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,290
Pfff! Pirate per Ci, pirates by there! What a time idiot!!!

164
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,770
But… now I am sour that you said anything to me.

165
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,310
Me I hate the pirates! What I like it is the money and the oranges

166
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,280
it is thus not possible that I travel with such pirates!

167
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,780
Hey hey! SUCH PIRATES? Do not be to you foutu to say that my pretty…

168
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,750
You want to speak about these oranges?

169
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,590
Hein?!

170
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,250
This orange tree…

171
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,120
Huuh!

172
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,960
Whaaahhaaaa…!!

173
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,790
It was what there immediately?

174
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,100
Hey! There are hands which have just pushed!!!

175
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,510
Magic oranges??

176
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,740
Who are you with the Juste?

177
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,920
Drop. These oranges…

178
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,940
They are the oranges of Belmer.

179
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,630
Why the orange trees of Belmer are on a similar ship?

180
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,610
It is damage but I am not with the current of these details.

181
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,260
Can be that you should read your log book?

182
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,230
Hein?

183
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,550
It seems me too to have seen the photograph of Belmer.

184
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,290
It is well my writing.

185
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,540
Belmer…

186
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,130
Belmer!!!

187
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,520
Belmer saaan look at I could harvest all that!

188
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,980
There are still green oranges. Nami!! Look at well before collecting them!!

189
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,150
But they were sweetened.

190
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,010
You ate some?! One must sell these oranges!!

191
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,780
It is not serious! It is we who will eat these green oranges.

192
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,040
Yes! Malicious Nojikooooo!

193
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,060
Quoiiiiii??!!

194
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,200
Huhuhu… Go two, with work!

195
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,490
I must return… can be that it occurred something to Kokoyashi.

196
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,490
In the final analysis… What is what it is that?

197
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:25,900
Yaah…!

198
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,620
A reindeer bizzaaare.

199
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,350
Hyahaaaaaa!!

200
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,440
A reeeenneeeee!!

201
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,920
Ouwa! Imbecil! Do not come here!

202
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,700
Meat of reindeer…

203
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,940
Is better out of discs, pulp with soft fire to make a râgout.

204
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,220
What? One can puff out this trick?

205
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,640
They is also very good out of steak with the sauce berry.

206
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,130
Out of steak…

207
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,650
Species of…

208
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,890
I AM NOT EDIBLE ME!!

209
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,620
It should not be eaten. He is our ship's doctor.

210
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,360
Ship's doctor?

211
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,390
Huh!

212
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,270
Exact! Even the men do not arrive to him at ankle.

213
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,300
Is not this step?

214
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,160
Heu… Huh… Hu…

215
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,910
Conceal toiii!! I am not at all glad to be flattered by human.

216
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,110
Ohh it with the very content air…

217
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,660
It is a reindeer which has receipt the intelligence of human by eating the fruit of the demon Hito Hito.

218
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,830
And on this subject me also I have to eat the fruit of Hana Hana.

219
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,870
And did Luffy, you also you eat a fruit of the demon is not this step?

220
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,020
Ouais! I puffed out the fruit Gomu Gomu and I became an elastic man.

221
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,930
Aharg!

222
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,340
It… there are three people who puffed out the fruits of the demon… Here is something of low register…

223
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,170
You are pirates… truths?

224
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,800
Yes, but you also you are one.

225
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,630
Of agreement! You also henceforth you make started from my crew!

226
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,460
Hein! Pourquoiiii??!!!!

227
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,070
You really take it with the serious one?

228
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:11,210
It does not matter. we were crossing this sea with another member of the crew.

229
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,410
Another???

230
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,930
You soon will go down not? Kenshi-san.

231
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,930
[Kenshi-san:Mister the swashbuckler]

232
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,360
Hein?

233
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,080
' Made too much noise as of the morning!

234
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
You prevent me from sleeping!

235
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,000
Qu… which… which… which are you? Present!

236
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,370
One must give his name before asking that of others.

237
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,480
Me it is magic Luffy!

238
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,490
Me it is Roronoa Zoro.

239
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,560
Hum? Be to you a hunter of pirate?

240
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,290
Huh…

241
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,900
I never said that I was a hunter of pirate.

242
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,460
They is the different ones which deduced that.

243
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,430
But that does not change anything has what you are, a hunter of premium!

244
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,570
When I do not have any more what to eat I am made pass for a hunter of premium.

245
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,870
It is not my true goal.

246
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,400
But the fact that you would be on this ship shows that you came for the premium from pirates not?

247
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,690
I do not know anything of it.

248
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,300
I do not know same step why I am here.

249
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,390
Are Z' famous pirates??

250
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,710
Eh you ace is envied to face me?! Come if you want it! Y has more than 8000 men under my orders!

251
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,750
Ooho!

252
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,620
Thus you must have a large premium,

253
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,300
that falls well I were precisely dry.

254
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,260
If you insist so much I will make of you my prey.

255
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,110
Eeuhhh noo not N… It is not what I wanted to say… hey! Calm you!

256
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,640
And say something to you!

257
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,550
But there is no premium on its head.

258
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,160
How çaaaa??!!

259
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,760
I must leave at all costs from here…

260
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,690
Hein?

261
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,210
huuuh!!

262
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,860
Gold!!

263
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,430
There is to repurchase the Kokoyashi village enough… and it will remain me even of the currency.

264
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,930
How I will make to carry it with me…

265
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,000
What is what Ca can be well?

266
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,610
Ehh!! It is what this trick?

267
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,760
Aaahaaarg….

268
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,400
Extra! I said myself well that also floated on the sea.

269
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,150
Ah? … It east left…

270
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,880
They is cool its trick.

271
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,160
Miss…

272
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,870
Pff! I include/understand nothing there but I do not have anything has to make here.

273
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,430
Hein!?

274
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,280
Ah… hein? He also it left… What is what they all have…?

275
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,650
What is what it occurs??

276
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,640
Me either I do not include/understand anything any more.

277
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,370
It is embarrassing…

1
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:57,015
Don't!!!

2
00:01:58,717 --> 00:01:59,384
I'm not lying! Damn!

3
00:01:59,384 --> 00:01:59,968
I'm not lying! Damn!

4
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:00,344
I'm not lying! Damn!

5
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:02,888
Those pirates are really gonna attack, right?

6
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,389
Those pirates are really gonna attack, right?

7
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,473
Those pirates are really gonna attack, right?

8
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:04,515
Those pirates are really gonna attack, right?

9
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:04,556
Those pirates are really gonna attack, right?

10
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:04,765
Those pirates are really gonna attack, right?

11
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:05,766
There's no doubt that they'll be coming.

12
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,391
There's no doubt that they'll be coming.

13
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:06,683
There's no doubt that they'll be coming.

14
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:06,767
There's no doubt that they'll be coming.

15
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:06,850
There's no doubt that they'll be coming.

16
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,017
There's no doubt that they'll be coming.

17
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:08,727
But everyone thinks that it's all a hoax.

18
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:09,728
But everyone thinks that it's all a hoax.

19
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:12,022
I love this village and want to protect everyonel

20
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:13,190
I love this village and want to protect everyone!

21
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,899
I love this village and want to protect everyone!

22
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:14,274
I love this village and want to protect everyone!

23
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:14,441
Alright, we will lend you a hand.

24
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:15,275
Alright, we will lend you a hand.

25
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,193
Alright, we will lend you a hand.

26
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,694
They are the Kurahadol's band of pirates!

27
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:17,736
They are the Kurahadol's band of pirates!

28
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:18,237
They are the Kurahadol's band of pirates!

29
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:18,529
They are the Kurahadol's band of pirates!

30
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:18,570
Scared, of course I am.

31
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,155
Scared, of course I am.

32
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,480
So what of it?

33
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,033
We are not laughing.

34
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:25,911
lf it was sympathy, would we put our lives at risk?

35
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:26,370
lf it was sympathy, would we put our lives at risk?

36
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:27,955
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

37
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:27,996
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

38
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:28,038
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

39
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:28,205
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

40
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:28,247
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

41
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:34,670
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

42
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:34,711
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

43
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:34,795
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

44
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:34,837
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

45
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:34,878
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

46
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:34,920
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,003
BATTLE! THE KURONEKO PIRATE CREW
BATTLE ON THE SLOPE!

48
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,195
Listen!

49
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,949
They're pIanning to attack the viIlage tomorrow
morning from this very coast

50
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:08,036
However, this is the only route
that leads to the viIlage.

51
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:08,996
However, this is the only route
that leads to the village.

52
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,581
The rest are cliffs.

53
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:12,791
There's no other way to attack.

54
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,001
ln other words, if we hold firm to this slope...

55
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,502
ln other words, if we hold firm to this slope...

56
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:16,086
ln other words, if we hold firm to this slope...

57
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,672
The village won't be attacked.

58
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:20,883
I see... that sounds simple.

59
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,969
Talking's easy, but we'll need
true strength for the battle.

60
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,721
What're you guys capable of?

61
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:26,555
Slicing!

62
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,473
Stretching!

63
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:28,515
Thieving!

64
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:29,808
l'll be hiding!

65
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:32,311
You will be fighting!!

66
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,897
Just Joking, I'll back you guys up.

67
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,237
Kurahadol-san, welcome back.

68
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:42,613
Kurahadol-san, welcome back.

69
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:42,738
Kurahadol-san, welcome back.

70
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:43,989
Where is ojousama?

71
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,407
She's already asleep.

72
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:47,659
She appeared to be exhausted.

73
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:54,458
Still, I never would've thought of such
a thing to happen while I was away.

74
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,961
That young man named Usopp
is a real troublemaker.

75
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:02,758
He even claimed that you were a pirate.

76
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:05,677
Such a ridiculous idea.

77
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,809
It surely is...

78
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,357
This is?

79
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,985
That's a present from ojousama to you.

80
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:22,069
That's a present from ojousama to you.

81
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:26,073
It has been 3 long years since you've
been a part of this house.

82
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:26,865
It's an anniversary gift.

83
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,117
It's an anniversary gift.

84
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:29,827
Anniversary...

85
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,413
It seems your glasses slip quite frequently,

86
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,166
so ojousama had this custom-made for you.

87
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,336
She is really attentive and considerate.

88
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:39,378
She is really attentive and considerate.

89
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,930
Speaking of anniversaries, tomorrow
will certainly be a day to remember.

90
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:02,109
It's a crescent moon tonight, isn't it?

91
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:10,826
A night like this makes my chest throb harder
and my blood boil for excitement.

92
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:19,126
Kurahadol-san! What do you think you're
doing with ojousama's present?

93
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:22,463
I have accepted the present.

94
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:23,005
I have accepted the present.

95
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:27,759
But that's not just that, it's
everything in this mansion!

96
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,471
W... what are you talking about?

97
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:30,721
W... what are you talking about?

98
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:30,804
W... what are you talking about?

99
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:33,765
There's no more need for me to continue this act.

100
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:34,933
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

101
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:35,184
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

102
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:35,350
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

103
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,434
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

104
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:35,559
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

105
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:35,684
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

106
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:35,726
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

107
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:35,809
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

108
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:35,934
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

109
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:36,059
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

110
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:36,560
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

111
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:36,602
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

112
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:36,685
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

113
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:36,727
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

114
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:36,810
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

115
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:36,935
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

116
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:37,186
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

117
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:37,686
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

118
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:37,936
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

119
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:38,187
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

120
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:38,437
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

121
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:38,562
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

122
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:38,687
In a few hours, an unexpected accident will occur.

123
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:43,901
These 3 years have been way too long!

124
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,067
These 3 years have been way too long!

125
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:44,234
These 3 years have been way too long!

126
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:44,610
These 3 years have been way too long!

127
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,194
These 3 years have been way too long!

128
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:45,277
These 3 years have been way too long!

129
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:45,319
These 3 years have been way too long!

130
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,360
These 3 years have been way too long!

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,402
These 3 years have been way too long!

132
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:45,444
These 3 years have been way too long!

133
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:45,486
These 3 years have been way too long!

134
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:45,527
These 3 years have been way too long!

135
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:46,278
These 3 years have been way too long!

136
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:46,403
These 3 years have been way too long!

137
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:46,445
These 3 years have been way too long!

138
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:46,528
These 3 years have been way too long!

139
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:48,697
Ojousama, RUN!!!.

140
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:29,590
Captain Jango!

141
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,509
lt's almost dawn.

142
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,511
Please wake up, Captain Jango!

143
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,140
Capt', good morning!

144
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,183
Good morning!

145
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:41,643
Idiots!

146
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:46,356
''Good morning'', in my book, should
only be said during mornings!

147
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:47,232
He seems to be in a foul mood.

148
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:47,900
He seems to be in a foul mood.

149
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,443
Maybe 'coz he just woke up.

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,861
Take a look!

151
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,781
The moon's still high up in the
sky, so it's still midnight.

152
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,616
Rememeber that clearly!

153
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,327
We're wrong, please forgive us!

154
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,703
As long as you get it...

155
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:10,005
Everyone, mornin'!

156
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:10,506
Everyone, mornin'!

157
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:10,589
Everyone, mornin'!

158
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:10,756
Everyone, mornin'!

159
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,006
Everyone, mornin'!

160
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:11,256
Everyone, mornin'!

161
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:14,551
Isn't saying ''mornin' '' contradicting yourself?

162
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:18,722
Moron! This just means that Capt'
is in a good mood now, that's all!

163
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:19,640
I see.

164
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:21,809
Don't use the back of your head
when talking to people!

165
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:24,269
Comrades!

166
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:26,939
Time to go!!

167
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,243
Good it's perfect!

168
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:40,410
Now they can't get up this slope.

169
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,788
Now they can't get up this slope.

170
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:46,375
The oil covered all over should do the job.

171
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:51,547
After they slip on the oil, we jump
in and wipe them all out.

172
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,424
Oil, eh...

173
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,220
Anyways, all we need to do is defend this slope!

174
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:01,515
But we should be careful not to slip on it ourselves.

175
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:04,968
Or else it'd be like getting trapped in quicksand.

176
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:08,188
You're kinda smart coming up with this trap!

177
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,482
Of course I am!

178
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,070
I have complete confidence in myself
with my traps and shooting pachinko!

179
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:24,121
It's almost damn!

180
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,014
They'll be coming.

181
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:02,826
We're here!

182
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:03,994
We're here!

183
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:06,455
Okay!

184
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:06,789
Comrades, listen now!

185
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:06,914
Comrades, listen now!

186
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:07,247
Comrades, listen now!

187
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:07,414
Comrades, listen now!

188
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:07,539
Comrades, listen now!

189
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,499
Comrades, listen now!

190
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:10,542
Let's get out there and do this!

191
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,588
Captain, there're two unidentified ships over there!

192
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,631
What?

193
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:18,175
Should we investigate?

194
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:19,176
Leave it alone.

195
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,011
It's not like it's a ship full of treasure.

196
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:22,387
Don't screw up the plan!

197
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,472
Understood!

198
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,933
You guys, hurry up and get going!

199
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,855
Not here yet?

200
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:34,274
And it's such a nice day too.

201
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:35,818
What do you think happened?

202
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:38,070
Maybe they overslept?

203
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:39,238
No way.

204
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,990
They'll definitely come.

205
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:42,950
They're just a little late.

206
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:47,871
Hey you guys...

207
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,165
I'm not sure if it's just me hearing things...

208
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:53,210
But, there seems to be people shouting somewhere.

209
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,176
I can definitely hear them alright.

210
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,545
Now that you mention it...

211
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:04,930
Hey, what wrong?

212
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,850
There's an exact same slope up north!

213
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:09,810
Don't tell me...

214
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,105
Maybe we're at the wrong coast?

215
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,317
Because they met on this coast, I assumed
they'd come from this side.

216
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:22,030
Hey, then we oughta hurry
or they'll attack the village!

217
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,073
Where's that coast?

218
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,494
Head straight north from here and it
should take you about 3 minutes.

219
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,830
The Iandscape is very similar to this one.

220
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,166
We just need to stop them from
climbing up the slope, but...

221
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,625
Don't worry, we'll make it somehow.

222
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:36,170
Oh crap!

223
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,632
The north coast that you mentioned
is where our ship is anchored!

224
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,342
All of my treasures will be taken!

225
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,052
l can be there in less than 20 seconds!

226
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:48,682
Damn! I came up with such a great plan for nothing!

227
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,517
My treasures...

228
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,143
Hey!

229
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,545
What're you doing?

230
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,187
Let's go!

231
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:54,680
We've gotta hurry...

232
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,777
Help me! I'm slipping!

233
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,045
Get your hands off, you idiot!

234
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:02,988
Sorry.

235
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:04,198
In that case... I'll go on ahead!

236
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:04,281
In that case... I'll go on ahead!

237
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,283
In that case... I'll go on ahead!

238
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:13,932
Sorry, it's 'coz my treasures are in danger.

239
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,001
You'll have to find a way on your own!

240
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:19,087
That woman is unforgivable!

241
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,224
I can't let them get to the village!

242
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:33,143
But that Luffy sure is quick.

243
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,312
He disappeared in an instant.

244
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:37,106
Head straight north...

245
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:38,315
Head straight north...

246
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:39,817
Head straight north!

247
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,128
Whoever dares to lay a hand on my treasures is...

248
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,238
Unforgivable!

249
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,998
What? There's someone up there!

250
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:57,960
It's you!

251
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,474
My name is Captain Usopp!

252
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:15,144
I've been waiting for quite a while!

253
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:22,234
I'm fully prepared for battle!

254
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,154
If you don't want to die then leave this place!

255
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,411
What's going on?! Why am I the first one here?

256
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:36,331
That guy should have been here ahead of me.

257
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:42,162
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

258
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:48,985
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

259
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,058
Damn!!!

260
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:59,229
l can't get past this..!

261
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:04,567
Why am I out of the village?

262
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:05,819
That's weird.

263
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:09,030
He did say north, so I ran to where it's cooler.

264
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,424
You're that guy from the other day...

265
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:22,043
The kid who eavesdropped on our conversation.

266
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,420
What do you plan to do?

267
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:26,756
I'm warning you, retreat immediately!

268
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:31,553
Otherwise, my 100 million men
will dispose of all of you!

269
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:35,015
100 million men?

270
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:37,017
Hey now, does he think he's dealing with kids here?

271
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,353
What?! 100 million men?

272
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:41,521
Incredible!

273
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,398
He's obviously lying Capt'!

274
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,066
How can you believe him so easily?

275
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,151
Crap, they saw through it.

276
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:49,321
He'd actually thought that we'd buy that.

277
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,824
You, how dare you try to deceive me!

278
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,826
Captain Jango, there's a problem!

279
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:55,994
I see, that's bad.

280
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,287
No, it's not bad news.

281
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:00,123
We found lots of treasures on that ship!

282
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:01,458
It's very valuable.

283
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,918
It's worth 40... no, 50 million beli!

284
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,836
What?!

285
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:08,381
5... 50 million beli?!

286
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:12,052
Why do they have so much on their ship?

287
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,597
Those treasure are mine!

288
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:17,390
I'll give it to you!

289
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:19,643
What? You're giving it to us?

290
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,402
That's right!

291
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:25,523
In return for the treasure, will
you now please retreat!

292
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,985
Now he wants to bribe us with money.

293
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:31,321
What a despicable guy.

294
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,448
Are you stupid?

295
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:35,241
We are pirates.

296
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,203
Of course we'll accept these treasures!

297
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:42,415
However, there's no reason for us to leave.

298
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,835
That's a little too...

299
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:52,050
After I say, ''One, Two, Jango!'',
you will move out of the way.

300
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,303
It's that weapon back when...

301
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:55,512
It,s that weapon back when...

302
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:56,763
One!

303
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,098
Two!

304
00:15:58,264 --> 00:15:59,265
Jun..!

305
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,059
Stop making up nonsense!

306
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:01,101
Stop making up nonsense!

307
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:01,226
Stop making up nonsense!

308
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:01,309
Stop making up nonsense!

309
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:01,351
Stop making up nonsense!

310
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:01,518
Stop making up nonsense!

311
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:01,559
Stop making up nonsense!

312
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:01,643
Stop making up nonsense!

313
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:07,816
That hurts!!!

314
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,484
Wh... who is that woman?!

315
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:13,738
Captain! This is no time to be hypnotized
and moving out of your own way!

316
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,449
The treasures on that ship are all mine!

317
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:19,369
I won't let you even have a single beli!

318
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,079
You'd better put everything back where it was!

319
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,850
That really hurts!

320
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,417
How can you just hand over my treasures?!

321
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:28,878
Couldn't you have just told me that?

322
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:30,588
What are you talking about?

323
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,923
I saved you!

324
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,636
I forgot to tell you, but you should never stare at that ring!

325
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:38,930
He's a hypnotist!

326
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,600
Hy... hypnotist?

327
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,643
So, where's Luffy?

328
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,770
Wasn't he the first one here?

329
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:46,896
Beats me.

330
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,858
Either he's still on the way
or he got lost somewhere.

331
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,861
He's probably lost then.

332
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,530
Geez... at such a critical moment too!

333
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,574
I'd better just give out orders.

334
00:16:57,676 --> 00:16:59,826
You go attack, while I cover you.

335
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,120
Hey, why does it have to be me?!

336
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:04,664
How can I fight such a large group?

337
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,041
I'm just a weak girl!

338
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,792
If you're expecting a man, don't look at me!

339
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,463
I'm so scared that even my legs are rattling... see!

340
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:13,089
So what!

341
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,259
I'm so afraid that I'm almost bursting into tears.

342
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,178
Your eyes are completely dry!

343
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:21,181
If you're gonna lie, at least make one that's believable.

344
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:23,350
You have no right to say that!

345
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,894
We have no time to fool around with them.

346
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,938
Get rid of 'em, immediately!

347
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,357
To the village, my comrades!

348
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:35,946
They're coming!

349
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,198
Oh yeah, I've got some caltrops.

350
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,617
You've got some good stuff in there.

351
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:41,409
Gimme, gimme!

352
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,498
Just you watch!

353
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:47,374
Caltrops!

354
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,125
Eat this!

355
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,221
Damn, that Nami!

356
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:02,806
Absolutely unforgivable!

357
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:13,108
I made it!

358
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:22,325
Where is that north coast?

359
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,953
Head straight north...

360
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:26,371
Head straight north...

361
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,372
Head straight north!

362
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:34,921
Which way's north?!

363
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:40,677
Great, it's working!

364
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:41,720
Now!

365
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,589
SATSU SHOOTING STAR!
(Satsu: Kill)

366
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:48,518
Bastards!

367
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,688
Not bad... Keep it up, okay?

368
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,898
I'm gonna take a short break.

369
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,567
Hey, you haven't fought anyone yet!

370
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:55,775
Hey, you haven't fought anyone yet!

371
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,277
What's wrong?

372
00:18:59,821 --> 00:18:59,863
There are caltrops back here, too.

373
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:02,741
Are you a moron? How did they end up back there?!

374
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,702
You're a hindrance!

375
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:17,881
Did you really think you could stop us?

376
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:22,093
Let's go everyone!

377
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,012
Captain Kuro's waiting!

378
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,644
What's up with this guy?

379
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,645
Let go of me!

380
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:32,520
You bastard!

381
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:33,772
Let go of me!

382
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,607
Damn you... bastard!

383
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:36,733
Bastard!

384
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,235
This slope...

385
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,822
I can't let you beyond it.

386
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:48,161
Because I'd like to keep lying as
I've always done in the past.

387
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,625
This village... will enjoy another day of peace like any other day.

388
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,671
That's why... I can never let you pass!

389
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:59,005
Shut up, you fool!

390
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:03,885
Why you...

391
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:08,223
That hurts!

392
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,183
You...

393
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:13,687
Will you stop this nonsense already.

394
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,399
Hey, you guys!

395
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:19,526
Just forget about 'em.

396
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:21,152
Hurry up and get going!

397
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,780
Or have you forgotten Captain Kuro's plan?

398
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:26,324
lf anything goes wrong with the plan...

399
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,785
We'll all be killed!

400
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,370
Understand?!

401
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,579
You bunch of imbeciles!

402
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:33,039
Hey...

403
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:34,624
Yeah, let's hurry to the village!

404
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,131
Stop...

405
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:42,632
Damn!

406
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,342
Stop!

407
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,304
Stop! Don't go to the village!

408
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:48,221
Shut up!

409
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:59,232
Stop... please...

410
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,527
Please don't kill them...

411
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:04,404
I love this village...

412
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,616
I want to protect it!

413
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:25,592
Wh... what's with all this, Captain Jango?

414
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:28,136
I never heard that there were such people in this village!

415
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:30,639
They're finally here.

416
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,770
What's all the ruckus?

417
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:37,812
How should I know?

418
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,272
But I'm still pissed off.

419
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,944
Nami! How dare you trample me down the slope!

420
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,612
Usopp, you bastard!

421
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:48,239
You didn't tell me which way was north!

422
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,660
Who are they?

423
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,793
They're late.

424
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,003
Those bastards...

425
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,259
Should clearly understand what'd happen if my plan were to be disrupted.

426
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,143
Yet still they take their sweet time.

427
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,106
If they forget the consequences...

428
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,651
I will kill them all!

429
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:47,582
That's Kurahadol from the mansion alright.

430
00:22:48,174 --> 00:22:51,219
Why is he heading towards the coast so early in the morning?

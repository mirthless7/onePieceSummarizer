1
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,250
IMPACT

2
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,000
burn blade!

3
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,590
You believe capacity to move
more quickly than the lightning?

4
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,600
FLEE, WIPER!!

5
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,010
NOT!!

6
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,660
Voices… The voices disappeared…

7
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,070
Thin then. My electricity seems
to be itself propagated in Milky Road.

8
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,929
The poor imbeciles.

9
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,900
Disappeared ISCED!
Splendid ruins of Shandora!!

10
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,149
Which talent.

11
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,280
Nami-san, they is marvellous!

12
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,779
It is again with you.

13
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,930
Yes, thank you.

14
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,829
I adore it.

15
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,810
It is much faster.

16
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,890
Yes, the Jet Dial had disappeared
since hundreds of years.

17
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,610
I was surprised to see
that this Waver was equipped with it.

18
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,740
But… What we must
to make now?

19
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,430
If everyone were there, we would have
been able to guide you towards bank of Skypiea.

20
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,140
Yes…

21
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,690
For the moment, I must carry out the boat on
the coast where we were given go.

22
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,200
I think that they are well…

23
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,099
Lastly, if all the four are together,

24
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,909
they will be left there.

25
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,440
There is no group
from four on the island.

26
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,950
Hein?

27
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,239
There is no group
of more than two people.

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,080
If four people were
together, I would know it.

29
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,640
Mantra?

30
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,080
The gift which this God has
and isn't its Priests?

31
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,330
I make use of it since my birth.

32
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,480
It is for that I am afraid.

33
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,680
You cannot imagine as it is
horrible when a voice disappears…

34
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,560
You still cry?

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,209
I DO NOT CRY!

36
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,619
Stupid girl of
Blue sea! Cretin!

37
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,960
Waver d' Aisa-san is damaged…

38
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,070
And found we it whereas it
made attack by celestial sharks.

39
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,170
What did you intend to make here?

40
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,749
I do not know.

41
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,900
But, it was necessary that
I do something!

42
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,029
Laki…

43
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,120
You all…

44
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,760
I wonder whether all
the world is well…

45
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,970
Oh not, that fears.

46
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,680
My backpack is outside.

47
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,729
The trees died and
there is no fruit above.

48
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,090
I sought this Bentou
for the breakfast.

49
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,859
It would be said that I fell
in funny of cave.

50
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,120
I still did not see the exit.

51
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,309
I wonder whether the others
found the Gold City.

52
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,029
Ca must be pretty with all this gold.

53
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,730
Ah yes, a long time ago of that, somebody in the bar said that gold delicious was cooked with the frying pan.

54
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,670
Ca makes one moment that I walk.

55
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,060
It is the hour to eat.

56
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,860
Not bad.

57
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,670
Who is there?!

58
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,069
What you tests to say to me?

59
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,000
You want my bentou?

60
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,480
You will not have anything!

61
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,330
Break!

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,960
Stop following me!

63
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,079
Listen!

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,089
I swallowed all my bentou!

65
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,759
I do not have anything any more to eat!

66
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,089
And even if I had some,
I would not give any you!

67
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,810
Now, out of my sight!

68
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,199
And you steps of through.

69
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,440
In which direction you do look at?

70
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,670
You want to fight? Hein?

71
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,900
In three hours, only 5
people on 81 will be still upright.

72
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,389
My prediction will be achieved
in one hour.

73
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,330
Currently, there remain 25 about it.

74
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,149
It is impossible!

75
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,239
Eneru God!

76
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,190
What does it make here?

77
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
I will kill it!

78
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,429
And now,

79
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,190
it of remainder 24.

80
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,679
He well, He well, my expensive!

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,360
You do not have the air so strong only that.

82
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,359
STOMACH

83
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,689
The monument!

84
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,089
Veinte flower

85
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,340
Calendula!

86
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,660
You will protect this city
in ruin still a long time?

87
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,860
You do not feel…

88
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,400
pas le less interest towards
our historical heritage.

89
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,390
I am not interested in the past!

90
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,630
Words of insane.

91
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,439
For which you take to me?!

92
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,179
PUNCH

93
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,779
I must attract it with the variation of the ruins.

94
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,840
If not, this cretin all will destroy.

95
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,139
This day…

96
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,439
I believed…

97
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,800
that my goal had been buried with
the underground sanctuary of Alubarna.

98
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,200
Believer to have very lost, I decided
to accompany Luffy in its voyage.

99
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,789
But like the unknown history
disappeared from the world in lower part,

100
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,980
there are perhaps indices,
some share in these ruins!

101
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,820
You intend to run like
that still a long time?!

102
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,640
You… finished running, now?

103
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,540
Yes.

104
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,880
But it is too late.

105
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,870
Too much late?

106
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,630
Never I will forgive myself.

107
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,909
You will never forgive me?

108
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,969
You make a point much of protecting these ruins.

109
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,040
Even if they do not belong to you.

110
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,479
Indeed.

111
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,919
The ruins do not belong to anybody.

112
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,320
I do not want to discuss
longer with you.

113
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,479
Do not make any you.

114
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
In little time, you will not be any more
able to speak, even if you want of it.

115
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,830
You will be soon
flattened like a pancake!

116
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,519
DROP

117
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,029
Here, we can fight freely.

118
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,429
Treinte flower

119
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,630
You charge a such mad bull.

120
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,170
Discover the weight of
the history which you destroyed!

121
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,459
Pound!

122
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,110
It is heavy…

123
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,099
Take that!

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,499
TEN-FOLD CENTERS!

125
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,440
CENTER MOUNTAIN!

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,300
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

127
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,390
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

128
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,400
My eyes!

129
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,109
What?

130
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,139
Hein?! He, wait!

131
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,989
Dials are with back!

132
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,060
Wait! Dials.!

133
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,750
The monuments which you destroyed
had a priceless value.

134
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,960
Invaluable treasures with
incommensurable importance.

135
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,830
The history can be repeated, but them
men cannot turn over in the past.

136
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,799
But you do not include/understand
not, isn't this?

137
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,750
I… Co… include/understand…

138
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,600
I…… will not start again
more, forgives…

139
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,390
I will never forgive it.

140
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,750
Then, I will have to kill you!

141
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,139
My fingers!

142
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,979
My fingers!!

143
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,379
Seis Fleur

144
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,359
Delphinium!

145
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,809
Ah, what?!

146
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,610
Stop!

147
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,459
Wait!

148
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,850
Where are you…?

149
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,470
Stop!!

150
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,400
No matter what you say, it is too late.

151
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,020
Ca hurts…

152
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,459
Clutch!

153
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,890
What you have fact is unnamable.

154
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,680
It must be the center of the city.

155
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,990
This monument does not appear on the chart.

156
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,850
Perhaps the buildings were dispersed
during the propulsion in the sky.

157
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,689
I do not include/understand…

158
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,260
Then why did you come here?

159
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,650
Hope and prediction
are two different things.

160
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,770
I expected to find
Rio Ponéglyphe.

161
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,120
Of all Ponéglyphes
existing on this ground…

162
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,520
It is the only stele which
tell the True History.

163
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,740
It is Rio Ponéglyphe.

164
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:54,700
True History? About what is it?

165
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,699
Ca is enough.

166
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,969
I sought during twenty years…

167
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,809
And it was the last
track that I had found.

168
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,170
This place was my last
hope, and it was a failure.

169
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,370
If I must die here, that is appropriate to me.

170
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,080
I am tired to follow
road which carried out me up to now.

171
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,340
Whereas I do not wish
that to learn the history…

172
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,510
Too many enemies are put
across my dream.

173
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,120
There is something of strange.

174
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,350
Is this really the City of Gold?

175
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,680
As I thought it, proportions and
topography are completely different.

176
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,350
And most unusual…

177
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,900
The single entry is at the higher level.

178
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,770
This would be…?!

179
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,590
I can go in lower part!

180
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,229
They is roomy.

181
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,580
As I thought it, these
ruins hide something.

182
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,400
They come from the Blue Sea, but
seem to be built on a îlonimbus.

183
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,519
I knew that something clochait.

184
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,940
The ruins on the clouds are in fact only
the upper part of the buildings of the city.

185
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,690
There is much more in lower part.

186
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,500
Light?

187
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,139
800 years ago…

188
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,390
the city of Shandora disappeared suddenly.

189
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,499
But it of it is nothing.

190
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,800
A great part remained intact…

191
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,699
And always also splendid.

192
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,690
Here the Gold City, Shandora!

193
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,010
This would be…?!

194
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,409
Another question, if I…

195
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,950
You want to say that the wire of the history
buried can be woven between them?

196
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,340
And what this Ponéglyphe is the trace?

197
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,179
It is here, in obviousness.

198
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,740
The ancestral writing of Ponéglyphes.

199
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,080
Only those which have creates Ponéglyphes
are able to decipher these symbols.

200
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,260
“Keep the truth in your
hearts, the closed mouth. “

201
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,830
“We are those who
will weave the history, “

202
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,080
[Belfry = bell-tower, turn of guet]

203
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,779
It is true.

204
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,930
There was here, an enormous gold bell.

205
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,920
It was in the book
of edge of Norland.

206
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,710
All books of
city were flarings.

207
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,649
History of this city…

208
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,990
was éradiquée.

209
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,290
They will be left there
all alone, not truth?

210
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,060
Stop following me!

211
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,160
Does Ca go down now?

212
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,900
Ponéglyphe was
transported in this city!

213
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,299
I am sure.

214
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,680
They fought here,
against a powerful enemy.

215
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,939
The Gold City, Shandora,

216
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,670
fought in order to protect
Ponéglyphe then was destroyed!

217
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,509
If it is the case,

218
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,820
Then the Large Belfry
between the four furnace bridges…

219
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,800
Perhaps tell the True History…

220
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,520
It is perhaps Rio Ponéglyphe.

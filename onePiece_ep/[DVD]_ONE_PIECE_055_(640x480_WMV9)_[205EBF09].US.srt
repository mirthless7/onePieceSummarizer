1
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:32,320
The crowned creature!

2
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:32,320
The secrecy of Apis and the legendary island!

3
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,780
Is Humm… it what?

4
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,110
He! I see a band of birds with starboard!

5
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,590
Included/understood!

6
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,750
Wait a little…

7
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,670
He, come to see…

8
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,800
It is a young girl…

9
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,310
The wind arrives. A strong wind…

10
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,110
Since presently,
the boat does not have advanced of a hair.

11
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,250
Oh not… We entered Calm Belt!

12
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,470
Charm Belt?

13
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,380
It is what?

14
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,810
Calm Belt! It is an area where water is calm!

15
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,080
Nagi No kaiiki = area where water is calm
Nami No Kairiki = the superhuman force of Nami

16
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,190
The superhuman force of Nami?

17
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,080
Cretin!!

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,010
Eh? An earthquake?

19
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,930
An earthquake?
In the ocean?

20
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,970
The guy, dispatch you stop speaking to lower the veils and start to row!

21
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,580
Bring back we where we were!

22
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,230
Immediately, Nami-San!

23
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,140
Why one must row?
It is a bateau à voiles.

24
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,520
It rightly! Why one should return whereas one has just moved away from the Navy?

25
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,590
Listen to me, we will have
big problems if we remain here!

26
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,180
But the sea is so calm…

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Well! I will explain you!

28
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,720
Listen! We summons parties with haste and we landed much more in the south that envisaged!

29
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,180
Therefore, we are on Grand Line?

30
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,000
If it were so easy to enter there, everyone would go!

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,130
Look at, Grand Line is located between two bands of ocean, Ok?

32
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,050
These two areas are called Calm Belt.

33
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,050
Nobody knows why but these two oceans have neither wind, nor current sailors.

34
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,580
It is simply an area CALMS permanently.

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,980
For the bateaux à voile, it is an area extremely dangerous to cross!

36
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,280
Luffy! You include/understand?

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,530
Yes! Just that they is not good…

38
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,960
I am happy that you seized!

39
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,020
Then, here what wanted to say the old man by saying that they was dangerous…

40
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,720
Therefore there is no wind.

41
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,120
There is nothing to make not?

42
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,890
We have only to wait until the wind begins again!

43
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,010
As I said, one will wait in vain it will not have there more the least wind!

44
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,180
And it is not all… It is not the only reason which makes that this zone is dangerous.

45
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,200
This place is…

46
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,400
What does it occur?

47
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,030
Something arrives!

48
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,190
Here they are!!

49
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,880
What is it?

50
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,290
Wahou! They are enormous!

51
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,740
ENORMOUS!!

52
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,220
Calm Belt is a ground of breeding of monstres marins!

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,310
And only for the large ones moreover…

54
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,160
This is why one cannot cross Calm Belt!

55
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,030
What will one make now?

56
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,590
For the moment, nobody moves!

57
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,610
We will be soon again in water…
And then… one will row thoroughly!

58
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,160
You pleasant!!

59
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,650
Why?

60
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,080
The frog arrives!!

61
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,750
Qu… Qu… What??

62
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,410
Caution!

63
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,760
Your arm is stretched!

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,760
Luffy, did you eat a Fruit of the Demon?

65
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,090
Ouais.

66
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,090
Luffy!

67
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,580
Drawn bar to the bottom still!

68
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,120
He He, Luffy!

69
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,130
What you insane?

70
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,750
I do not know!

71
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,560
Apis!

72
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,680
Pay attention!

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,720
Ok, now…

74
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,970
What did it make?

75
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,190
To tear off a hair of nose!

76
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,170
Wait one second…

77
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,670
If you do that,

78
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,330
this thing will sneeze!

79
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,490
It is an enormous hair of nose!!

80
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,510
Ok! One goes there!

81
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,800
What???

82
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,750
How can you be also unconscious?

83
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,660
Incredible! It is as if one flew!

84
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:30,070
One really flies!!

85
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,580
It would be said that one returned where one was.

86
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,290
And no sign of the Navy.

87
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,540
I thought that I was going to die…

88
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,420
Well.

89
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,060
Thank you!

90
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,760
Ok! All sails!

91
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,880
Our destination?
Of course,

92
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,120
the Gunkan island!

93
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,430
I do not see anything the whole.

94
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,670
You can see the fog!

95
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,930
Apis, are you sure that it is in the corner?

96
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,400
I do not know!

97
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,600
How can you say that?

98
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,060
That should be some share by here…

99
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,690
You are so strong, Nami-San!

100
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,860
I really do not include myself/understand…

101
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,940
Oh… Over there!!

102
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,710
Ooh, a boat

103
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,710
Go approach!

104
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,020
There is something which you do not find enormous?

105
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,280
Therefore, should I say that it is super méga enormous?

106
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,440
Not!

107
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,070
It is the Gunkan island!

108
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,960
It resembles a battleship,
this is why it is called Gunkan!

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,450
He, cool!

110
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,540
This boat…

111
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,600
Pirates!

112
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,420
Pirates! The pirates are there!

113
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,410
Pirates?

114
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,680
Return!

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,170
Cuckoo! I am of return!

116
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,850
Apis?

117
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,680
Why are you… on a pirate boat?

118
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,300
What does it occur?

119
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,820
He, you over there!

120
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,350
What do you want?

121
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,550
Is there a restaurant of Yakiniku on this island?

122
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,560
Yakiniku = roasted Meat

123
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,960
Hein?

124
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,060
Who are these guys?

125
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,450
Look at… Even if they are pirates,
they are good pirates.

126
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,560
Does that exist a pirate good?

127
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
But you had not been made remove by the Navy?

128
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,070
Yes! But I am flee and then

129
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,620
Did Luffy and its crew save me, not true?

130
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,200
Apis, which did you make?

131
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,150
I do not know why,
but the Navy sought you.

132
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,490
But you should not return at home.
They still trail in the corner.

133
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
Oh not…

134
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,120
We would like to help you but…
these guy are pirates!

135
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,440
Which embarrassment…

136
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,600
But, she said that we were good pirates.

137
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,440
Apis!

138
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,530
Come here immediately!

139
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,980
Who is this?

140
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,830
Do not know!

141
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,590
Bokuden grandfather!

142
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,340
I am content that you are well!
Thank you to have saved Apis!

143
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,970
I would like to accommodate you
cordially at home!

144
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,660
Is this… a restaurant with Yakiniku?

145
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,520
It is not a restaurant with Yakiniku but

146
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,890
Grand-père Bokuden makes best Butaman of the island!

147
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,890
Butaman = Sandwich with the pig

148
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,700
Brilliant! Allons-y!

149
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,810
Sure, allons-y!

150
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,890
It is it!

151
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,810
Eriiiiik!

152
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
I am with your humble service!

153
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,110
This girl was trapped in Calm Belt
and left itself there alive.

154
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,630
Impossible! This little girl?

155
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,240
Now, you…

156
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,360
Now, you will turn over on the Gunkan island!

157
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,470
Again capture it by all the means!

158
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,770
Then, they succeeded in passing Calm belt?

159
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,270
All is ready!

160
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,090
All is not prepared, we do not have any more but to wait.

161
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,220
Super!

162
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,670
That feels good!

163
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
Oh, it is sure that it is an old dish.

164
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,680
Will grandpa, how long that take?

165
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,970
Hmmm, about… 4 or 5 hours I think…

166
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,970
Aahh… I have if hunger!

167
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,430
Was Bokuden-San, why Apis kidnapped by the Navy? You know?

168
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,870
Do Apis, you have an idea?

169
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,680
At all!

170
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,700
But you had said to us that there was a reason of which you could not speak!

171
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,160
Oh, I lied!

172
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,900
Eh well… there is a reason.

173
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,830
It has just said the opposite!

174
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:55,450
There are not large thing on this island but that
could be due to our old legend.

175
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,660
A legend?

176
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:04,500
The inhabitants of this island are known like
descendants of Lost Island which ran it there
is 1000 years old with the height of its prosperity.

177
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,330
Lost Island was the country of dragons called Sennenryu.

178
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,330
Sennenryu = thousand-year-old Dragons

179
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,950
The bones of these dragons are called Ryukotsu and are supposed to give an elixir bringing the eternal life.

180
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,150
I include/understand…

181
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,940
But this legend is not a reason with the implication of the Navy.

182
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,270
Yes. Which is the interest of the Navy?

183
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,450
I do not include/understand either.

184
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,200
There would not be a kind of allusion in this legend?

185
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,770
Initially, first king de Lost Island was Iskandaq…

186
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,510
Ca is there! It set out again!

187
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,820
Now Pokepo had 3 wire.

188
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,660
The first wire was Bokehontasu,
the second was Bokebonbon,
and the third was Bokebokepon.

189
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,170
One day, the king says this to them:

190
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,690
“Listen to three, will seek the tree of which them
fruits are stars in the valley of the dragons. “

191
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:01,540
And thus, Bokehontasu, bokebonbon and bokebokepon left courageously to research the valley…

192
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,540
When it starts, one cannot any more stop it.

193
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:10,360
And then, with the 317ème generation, Yugrimori,
wire of Ingrimori III, became a large leader.

194
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,400
Will He, how long continue?

195
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,230
I do not know!

196
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:16,910
It had 18 wire. These 18 wire…
As a king, it engaged a great revolution.

197
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,260
I am hungry…

198
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,560
But this king had full children…

199
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,580
Highly that it finished its history!

200
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,160
When will one eat these Butaman?

201
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,600
With time, these grandchildren were born and it finished its life with 65 heirs!

202
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,430
Butaman…

203
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,440
They said that if one sent a stone on the kingdom, the princes would be wounded! He He!

204
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,130
Luffy?

205
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,580
I will piss!

206
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,190
Butaman…

207
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,570
Hold good, Ryuji.

208
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,810
Oh not!

209
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,900
It arrives! What do I make?

210
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
Please, do not come by here!

211
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,880
Butaman… that feels so good…

212
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,680
It is not true?

213
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,040
I did not even strike it yet!

214
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,590
Butaman…

215
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,130
And then, with the 1111ème generation, not it was
with the 1121ème, there was Hokehontasu.

216
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,960
A little afterwards, Nemenemetasu entered the army and thought:
“how can I protect this man?”

217
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh, where do you thus go?

218
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,910
I worry just about knowing why
Luffy is so long! I will check.

219
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,090
Before the countries donot can attack, it ordered the beginning of the preparations in the kingdom.

220
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,360
Not just…

221
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,050
Nami-San is so splendid when it is furtive!

222
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,850
Ouf… what a relief!

223
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,620
Luffy!!

224
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,630
They have all disappeared!!

225
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,400
They is good!

226
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,530
You us did not even leave one of them!
What do you have to say for your defense?

227
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,080
About what you do speak?

228
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,840
Hein? What is it?

229
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,330
Where does that go?

230
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,410
Did that disappear?

231
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,360
What does it occur?

232
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,430
He Do Luffy, what you make?

233
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,100
A hole!

234
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,590
It seems that crossed…

235
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,960
Luffy?

236
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,410
Of course!

237
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,290
Ryuji?

238
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,450
We are behind the mountain.

239
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,080
Where that does it carry out us?

240
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,610
Ah… What is it?

241
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,450
Yes, I am well.

242
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,110
Strange pirates saved me.

243
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,910
Not, they are not malicious.

244
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,500
I have some Butaman of Bokuden grandfather for you!

245
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,210
Here! He, does not swallow them at the same time all!

246
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,440
I am afflicted, I still do not know.

247
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,980
I try to find of all my forces,
but I always do not have any index.

248
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,820
Apis… With which speaks it?

249
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,750
Yo Apis! With which speak you?

250
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,020
Do not shout abruptly like that!

251
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,500
Not, remain behind!

252
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,900
Luffy, that there is…

253
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,670
Hein??

254
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,000
Wahou! Too much cool!!

255
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,910
Stop! please stop!

256
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Wait, Luffy!

257
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
It is a truth! It is alive!

258
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,190
Stop! Leave it quiet!

259
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,580
Incredible… They exist!

260
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,230
I believed that the dragons were right legendary animals!

261
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,320
Enormous! You come from where?

262
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:46,210
I see… You want to turn over at home?

263
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,390
Ryuji says that he is your friend Luffy.

264
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,460
It knows that you are somebody of nice.

265
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,760
Luffy, how do you include/understand Ryuji?

266
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,890
How that!

267
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,100
Like that?

268
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,630
You can also include/understand it not?

269
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,820
Not, in fact… I…

270
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,950
Would this be a Fruit of the Demon?

271
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,710
You the capacity of a Fruit of the Demon, isn't this has?

272
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,600
Yes, I ate the fruit Hiso Hiso!

273
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,600
Fruit of the whisper

274
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,050
Afterwards, I could listen to the heart of any animal.

275
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,360
It is for that you had guessed for the wind presently.

276
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,590
Yes! The gulls said it to me.

277
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,050
I also met Ryuji thanks to the fruit Hiso Hiso.

278
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,750
Who is this?

279
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,750
A so sad voice…

280
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,130
Ever understood anything tel.

281
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,580
Await me, I come to help you!

282
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,160
Therefore, it is you who called me?

283
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,830
Ryuji lost all its force and
was separated from his/her companions.

284
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,300
He sought only the place called
the nest of the dragons, Lost Island.

285
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,450
Lost Island? The island which ran 1000 years ago?

286
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,140
Ryuji says that the island will remake surface.

287
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,970
“That should be now” says it, but it
does not remember the localization of the island.

288
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,530
It lost all its force and its capacity to be flown but it continues to say that it wants to turn over at his place.

289
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,160
I want to help it but I do not have any idea
place where can be the island.

290
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,010
There are no indices in the old legend…

291
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,910
Then by chance, I asked the Navy which passed in the corner.

292
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,140
But I made an error.
They seek the ryukotsu.

293
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,550
Ryukotsu? To have eternal youth?

294
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,850
It kidnapped you for that, isn't this Apis?

295
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,020
Yes… They said to me that I were all to tell and they kidnapped me,

296
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,330
surely because I carried the claw into pendentive that Ryuji had given me.

297
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,100
Therefore you were outside in full storm.

298
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,780
You are caught too the head!

299
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,250
I know, it is for that I do not speak about it to the villagers nor with Bokuden-San.

300
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,350
I do not want to torment them with that.

301
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,620
But I want to bring back Ryuji on his lieu de naissance to any price!

302
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,550
Ryuji, you always say that.

303
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,260
If you turn over to the nest of the dragons,
you will find surely your force.

304
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,580
What imports time that will take,
I will find it for you!

305
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,390
It is sure! No matter what it arrives,
I will find it for you!

306
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,610
Good! In this case, I bring you to it!

307
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
Did Luffy, you listen?

308
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,520
She said that lost Island had run in the ocean.

309
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,750
But legendary Sennenryu said it.

310
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,510
Lost Island must be some share!

311
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,090
An island which isn't on any chart?

312
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,110
Yes! Therefore let us go there we!

313
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,530
An island which is not on any chart…

314
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,380
If you say it… Allons-y!

315
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,500
It is true? You are serious?

316
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:23,940
Yes!

317
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,110
Thank you!

318
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,190
Now how it is decided, take more!

319
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,560
Luffy! I forgot to say it to you front but…

320
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,560
Ryuji is a little senile!

321
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,690
This girl has pendentive made with a claw of Sennenryu.

322
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,960
Without any doubt, she knows the position of Lost Island.

323
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,570
Little girl who maintains the secrecy of the ryukotsu,
this time I will have you!

1
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:54,254
Go to hell!

2
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,205
Oni-giri!

3
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,838
I can't believe I lost to thieves.

4
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:03,060
We aren't thieves. We are pirates!

5
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:05,589
The map of the Grand Line!

6
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,837
I will never forgive him!

7
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:15,805
(Episode 8) "Who Will Win? Showdown
Between the True Powers of the Devil!"

8
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:21,283
(Episode 8) "Shousha wa Dotchi?
Akuma no Mi no Nouryoku Taiketsu!"

9
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:25,171
<i>(Based on Manga ch.19: "Devil Fruit", ch.20:
"The Way Of The Thief" and ch.21: "Townies")</i>

10
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,067
In my whole life, nobody has
ever made me hate someone so much.

11
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:34,438
Shanks took my most
important treasure away.

12
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,041
I don't know what's your
relationship with him....

13
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,515
...but I'll say what I want about him!

14
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,484
There you two go, fighting again!

15
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:48,319
It's                                          No, it's
North Pole!                                 South Pole!

16
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,553
You never stop.

17
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:52,690
I am right. Why should I stop?

18
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:53,924
You really have guts!

19
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,559
Let's fight until one of us lose!

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,894
Show me what you got!

21
00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:01,131
I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget!

22
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,666
Enough!!

23
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:06,103
Why is it so important to
know which pole is colder?

24
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,573
If you really wanna know,
find out for yourselves!

25
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:10,841
You need to cool off!

26
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,743
Ship approaching!

27
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:15,513
Enemy from the northeast!

28
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,714
Head straight for them!
It's time to fight!

29
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:19,750
Aye!

30
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,986
Ok, rob as much as we can.

31
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:23,320
You look happy, Buggy.

32
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,622
Of course.

33
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:27,458
An enemy boat is like
a big treasure box.

34
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,146
It's our destiny to rob as pirates.

35
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,463
You are so right.

36
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:33,964
You're too soft.

37
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:38,602
You are like the other
pirates. You're all too easy!

38
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:40,782
You don't know what a
pirate is really like.

39
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,209
What's this?

40
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:54,613
T-T-Treasure
map!

41
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,882
It's great to see it.

42
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:01,758
It's undersea.

43
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:05,462
<i>Great.</i>

44
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:09,822
<i>Now I will be the
richest man in the world!</i>

45
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,761
It's a total victory today!

46
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:23,314
Hey, Buggy!

47
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:26,884
Why don't you join us?
There are some trophys.

48
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:30,721
I didn't take anything!
I don't know anything!

49
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,556
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:33,862
Nothing...

51
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,599
You said you will
leave the boat someday.

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,634
What are you gonna do?

53
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,402
I want to have my own boat.

54
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:49,139
Find some reliable crewmen
and see the whole world.

55
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,874
No matter how long it will take.

56
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,611
I will still be a pirate.

57
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:56,218
You are so naive.

58
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:56,880
What?

59
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,984
But you're a good fighter,
I'll tell you what.

60
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:04,121
If you are not that naive, I would
love to take you as my crewman.

61
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:07,355
Your crewman? Are you kidding?

62
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,860
We have different ambitions.

63
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,696
We're better off on our separate ways.

64
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,698
That's what pirating's all about.

65
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,234
You call yourself pirate?

66
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:21,071
If we meet on the sea, we will fight.

67
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:24,174
Yes, that's also what
pirating's all about.

68
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:26,975
Sometimes, you baffle me.

69
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:30,581
Didn't you just say "trophy"?

70
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,431
Yeah. There was the
devil fruit. Devil fruit?

71
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:37,421
They say it was enchanted by sea devils.

72
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:41,058
You will get amazing powers after eating
it, but you will be cursed by the sea.

73
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,394
You have to stay on land.

74
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:46,697
What kind of idiot would eat that?

75
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:51,669
<i>If you can't swim, how can you
get the treasure buried under sea?</i>

76
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,064
Some would pay 100
million belly's for it.

77
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,260
What?

78
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:04,521
I, apprentice pirate Buggy,
will now eat the devil fruit!

79
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:09,006
It's good to be young. You don't
have to think about the consequences.

80
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:17,828
Now what, Buggy? Feel any different?

81
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:20,837
No, nothing. It's a fake.

82
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:26,765
Devil fruit is only a legend.

83
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:29,673
It worked.

84
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,208
It's too smooth.

85
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,977
The fake is my masterpiece.

86
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,680
I can't believe it's so easy!

87
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,717
I will get out of the
boat when nobody notices.

88
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,820
With the money of selling the devil
fruit and the treasure from the map,

89
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:46,323
I can buy a pirate crew!

90
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,524
Hey, Buggy.

91
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,460
Why're you laughing?

92
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:51,829
It's you. Don't scare me.

93
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,926
What's with that look?

94
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,300
Stop stealing food...

95
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,507
...or the cook will skin you alive.

96
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,204
<i>That was close...</i>

97
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:02,537
Oh, one more thing, the captain said...

98
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,583
Shanks, you bastard!
You... you... you...

99
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,587
What's that paper?

100
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,856
My map!

101
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:20,608
Hey, Buggy!

102
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:26,062
<i>What's happening? I can't move right!</i>

103
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:30,227
<i>The fruit is working. Help me!</i>

104
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:33,036
What's wrong?

105
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,432
You supposed to be
good at swimming, right?

106
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,069
Buggy!

107
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,862
<i>Help me!</i>

108
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:46,118
I am coming, Buggy!

109
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,613
So Shanks saved your life.

110
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:00,664
That's against the point!

111
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:05,669
It was him who delayed my
grandiose plan for years!

112
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,271
I was still determined.

113
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:11,608
If I can't get the treasure IN the
sea, I'll take the treasure ON the sea!

114
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:15,112
I have the Chop-Chop power.

115
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:18,115
If anyone tries to touch my treasure...

116
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:21,895
They're dead meat!

117
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,857
Hands off...

118
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,092
...my treasure!

119
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:30,697
I've been found out!

120
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:36,166
Don't think you can
get away from me, Nami!

121
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,001
I will chop you up!

122
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:59,573
Curse you, Gomu Gomu boy!

123
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:02,493
I'm still your opponent!

124
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:07,664
Something's wrong.

125
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:10,834
It's been a long time.
What happened to the mayor?

126
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,570
Maybe something happened in town.

127
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:17,040
The sound of the cannon fire
was much more louder than usual.

128
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,109
OK! I'm going into town.

129
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,677
You guys wait here.

130
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:21,812
I am going too.

131
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:25,015
Stupid, they are pirates.

132
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:26,717
It's Buggy's pirate crew!

133
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:29,219
That's why I am going with you.

134
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,824
If we can't protect the mayor,
what kind of citizens are we?

135
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,626
You can't stop us.

136
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,435
It's our choice.

137
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:41,492
Very well. Let's go!

138
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:44,902
Yeah!

139
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,587
Hey.

140
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,956
Drop the loot and get out!

141
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:08,357
He'll keep coming after you.

142
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,558
No!

143
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,727
You want me to leave the treasure?

144
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:12,862
I will never do that!

145
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,864
Why should I give up the treasure?

146
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,567
What do you mean "never"?

147
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:19,969
That's right!

148
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,271
I am a master thief!

149
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,107
And I stole your treasure!

150
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:29,171
That's why I said! They are mine!

151
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,125
Uh...okay.

152
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,517
Bull! That's mine!

153
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:37,520
It's not yours until
you get away with it!

154
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:41,624
It's a basic fact about pirating!

155
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,728
Criminal lecturing
criminal. What a joke.

156
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,494
What?

157
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:52,693
I'd never stoop so low as
to take lessons from you!

158
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:59,775
Then suffer the consequences, Nami.

159
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:03,339
CHOP! CHOP!

160
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:07,781
FESTIVAL!

161
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:13,756
Try to save your friend
now, GOMU GOMU NO Boy!

162
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,752
Damn, he's all over the place! Oh?

163
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,634
What?

164
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:21,472
Nami!

165
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,684
Give it back! No way!

166
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,773
How do you like this?

167
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,916
Cut it out!

168
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,054
The one who'll cut it out...

169
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:44,164
...is you!

170
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,619
I will take the treasure.

171
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,465
Let go! Let go!

172
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,968
Let go of it! It's mine!

173
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,467
You let go!

174
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:05,957
Go to hell!

175
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,536
You're supposed to be fighting me!

176
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:40,601
That was for the mayor.

177
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,381
Thank you for saving me.

178
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:47,182
No problem.

179
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,021
Hey! The map! My treasure!

180
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,590
Not so fast, Gomu Gomu Boy!

181
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,325
He's still alive!

182
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:57,693
Shut up!

183
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,063
Look what you have done to me.

184
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:03,662
I will never forgive you!

185
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,543
CHOP! CHOP! Come Together!

186
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,152
What?

187
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,681
Are you looking for this?

188
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:25,645
My body!

189
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,851
Good job, master thief!

190
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:31,695
Goodbye, Buggy!

191
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:34,430
GOMU GOMU NO

192
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,631
Wait!

193
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,672
BAZOOKA!

194
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,809
I win!

195
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:56,185
Hey, Buggy was kicked
up high to the sky.

196
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:59,612
What do we do?

197
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,920
Keep playing dead. OK.

198
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:10,699
It means alot to you, doesn't it?

199
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,635
It's OK! I can still wear it.

200
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:16,869
Felt good to kick Buggy's butt!

201
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:25,147
Hold on. Let me help you.

202
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:25,976
With what, Nami?

203
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:29,118
You can help me carry this.

204
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,453
I split them into two
bags. You carry one for me.

205
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,655
It's so heavy.

206
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,257
You are so...

207
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:39,795
Buggy was picky on
treasure. Nice quality.

208
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,654
It's worth at least ten million belly's!

209
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:48,779
Take it.

210
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:51,840
The map of the Grand Line.

211
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:52,908
Isn't it what you want?

212
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:53,942
You want to give me that?

213
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,477
Who told you to save me?

214
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,713
Thank you, Nami.

215
00:14:57,714 --> 00:15:01,083
I finally got the map of the Grand Line.

216
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,785
Yippee!

217
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:06,155
Would you like to join our crew?

218
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:10,014
I said I didn't want to
be part of a pirate crew!

219
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,693
But I admit...

220
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:14,496
It's good money though.

221
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,166
But I wanna say it's only cooperation.

222
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,148
Remember that.

223
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,588
Ok.

224
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,973
Hey, Zoro. Get up.

225
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:27,934
Let's go, Zoro.

226
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:30,712
All done? Yes.

227
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:34,514
Both the map and the crew are found.

228
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,689
God, I lost too much blood.

229
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,857
I can't walk now.

230
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,925
Of course not!

231
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:46,228
If you can walk, I wouldn't believe
that any of you you're human.

232
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:47,930
Don't lump me with him!

233
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:50,332
You're even less human than he is!

234
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,450
What about the mayor? Oh yeah.

235
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,513
We should wake him up too.

236
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:58,073
Hey you!

237
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,576
Are you strangers?

238
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:02,211
What about you?

239
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,913
We are citizens of this town.

240
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,483
Did the pirates mutiny or something?

241
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,518
Come on, talk.

242
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,089
Townspeople? What a relief. I
thought they were pirates, too.

243
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,157
It's the mayor!

244
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,925
Mayor! Are you hurt?

245
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:17,826
Mayor!

246
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,128
He's blacked out. It
must be the pirates.

247
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,964
Damn it!

248
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:24,697
Sorry I hit that old man!

249
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,971
They didn't have to know that!

250
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,706
You saw it, too. Didn't you? I did.

251
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:32,294
But there is a reason...

252
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,780
Why did you do that to him?

253
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,148
Explain yourself!

254
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,577
Who are you? Are you with the pirates?

255
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,487
<i>I can smell a fight coming.</i>

256
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:48,057
<i>If he said he is a thief or a pirate...</i>

257
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:49,310
We are pirates!

258
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,147
Get them!

259
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,566
Idiot! It's true!

260
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,667
Pirates!

261
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,103
How dare you to ruin our town like that?

262
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,665
Even if you were a child,
we won't forgive you.

263
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,641
Now what?

264
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:08,408
They wouldn't listen to whatver I say.

265
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,712
Run fast.

266
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,239
Get them!

267
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,483
Don't let them get away!

268
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:17,421
How dare you attack our mayor like that?

269
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:26,722
Why do you always make things worse?

270
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,999
Everyone loves the mayor.

271
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:39,942
No matter how we explain,
they will be angry anyway.

272
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,610
Turn here.

273
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:44,046
Hold on. You should
have said it earlier!

274
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,066
They're in the alley!

275
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,783
Chou Chou. That dog.

276
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,628
Get away, Chou Chou!

277
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:00,696
Hey.

278
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:03,508
They are bad people! You are
barking at the wrong person.

279
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,569
Why stop us?

280
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,864
Chou Chou! Let us through.

281
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,348
Chou Chou.

282
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:25,942
Bye, dog.

283
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,531
It's so scary.

284
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,767
Chou Chou let us escape.

285
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:41,169
Why are we always in bad luck?

286
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,671
It doesn't matter.

287
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,473
Things are all done.

288
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:45,874
You are right.

289
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,576
Hey, is this your boat?

290
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:49,044
It's nice.

291
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,880
I think it's OK.

292
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,149
It's stolen from a pirate.

293
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,144
You are really something!

294
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,721
You are finally here, girlie.

295
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,686
I didn't expect to see you here.

296
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,895
Your friends? We had a bad history.

297
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,666
Not just that. We hate each other.

298
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,100
You have pals.

299
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,903
Then I will kick their butts too!

300
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,840
It's not right to steal other's things.

301
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:23,698
Hey, I am talking to you.

302
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,217
Mayor! You're awake!

303
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,562
Thank goodness.

304
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:42,029
What happened?

305
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:45,901
What the heck?

306
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:48,403
When we got here, it
was already like this.

307
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:52,005
The rest of the pirates have run away.

308
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,777
Don't you know what happened?

309
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,997
Where are the kids?

310
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:00,381
Kids? Are you talking
about the three kids?

311
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,883
Are they still alive?

312
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:08,816
That kid! How he treated
an old man like me...

313
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:15,163
We chased those imbeciles out of town!

314
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,698
But I am still mad.

315
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,649
They thought we were worthless!

316
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,835
Look what they have done to this town!

317
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:23,834
They will never know
how much we really have!

318
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:25,607
You are so right.

319
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,269
Let's go find them, and drag them back!

320
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,344
Shut up!

321
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,481
I'm the only one who has
the right to call them names!

322
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:35,784
Nobody else but me!

323
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,587
What? Why do you protect the pirates?

324
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:41,282
They ran away without hearing from me?

325
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,016
Where did they go?

326
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,627
They ran to the port.

327
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,865
The nerve of that kid!

328
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:53,001
How dare you do this to my town!

329
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,087
I have a lot of things to say to you!

330
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,788
OK, let's go!

331
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:06,848
That sail has Buggy's mark!

332
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,466
It was his boat. I will
get rid of it later.

333
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,555
Hey, hold on!

334
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:15,657
Kids!

335
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,681
Mayor.

336
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,936
<i>Buggy would have killed me!</i>

337
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:32,433
<i>I was desperate and thinking
it was OK, even if I die.</i>

338
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,768
Thank you! I will
remember your kindness!

339
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:41,326
You're welcome! Take it easy!

340
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:49,648
Kids...kids...kids...

341
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:52,073
I don't know what to say.

342
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,902
What?

343
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,505
You left a bag of treasure there?  Yes.

344
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,541
It was worth half a million belly's!

345
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:10,212
They needed the money
to rebuild the town.

346
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:12,314
That was MY treasure!

347
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:15,717
It took me a lot of
effort to steal them!

348
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:17,586
How dare you!

349
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,788
Stop it! I can't swim!

350
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:21,356
I know you can't!

351
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:23,391
Go get it if you want.

352
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,794
It's too late! You go get it!

353
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:26,995
No way.

354
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:28,496
I will die.

355
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:30,498
Come on. Just die once for me.

356
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,512
If you do it again, I will
throw you into the sea!

357
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:37,873
I don't know if it's our luck or not.

358
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:41,998
<i>Anyway, we have one more
pirate with us on the search.</i>

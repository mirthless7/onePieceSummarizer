1
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,920
Gasoline of a powerful sword!

2
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,920
Capacity to slice the steel and the breath of any thing

3
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,010
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,310
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,980
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,690
In order to save Arabasta, the companions continue the combat.

7
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,290
Usopp and Chopper left victorious.

8
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,950
Sanji overcame Mr. 2 Good Clay.

9
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,760
And Nami also fights it, against Miss Doubles Finger in a combat with death.

10
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,540
Take that!

11
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,950
What?

12
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,620
I was done trapped!

13
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,310
Thanks to the invention of Usopp, the Climate Tact, Nami gained the victory.

14
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,590
Now…

15
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,410
only the result of the combat between Zoro and Mr. 1 remains dubious.

16
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,750
If I include/understand well, your body is as hard as steel.

17
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,120
To overcome you, it is necessary that my blades can slice steel.

18
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,290
It is well that.

19
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,670
The blows and the shocks which you can carry me do not even tickle me.

20
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,270
I see.

21
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,360
It is tedious that.

22
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,140
As long as I do not manage to cut steel,
I will not be able to beat you.

23
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,470
What will you make then?

24
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,360
Eh well!

25
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,840
To have pity for you.

26
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,570
What?

27
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,270
Ca at the right moment! I awaited this kind of desperate plight!

28
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,510
That will enable me to become even stronger.

29
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,720
Because once I will have beaten you…

30
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,760
I will be the man able to split steel.

31
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,350
When you will have overcome me?

32
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
We will have to check what your enthusiastic heat makes you say.

33
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,830
But since the day when I obtained the capacity Supa Supa, and until now,

34
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,470
none of those which proclaimed epeists were able to scratch me.

35
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,940
As a epeist, you cannot overcome me.

36
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,290
Ouais, I see what you want to say.

37
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,090
But you would make better have these pretty memories for your album photo.

38
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,170
It does not matter the number of epeists whom you fought in the past.

39
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,480
You never met me front.

40
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,050
Your language, it at least, is sharpened.

41
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,760
I take that like a compliment.

42
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,740
Bouffor of octopuses!

43
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,120
How long will that last?

44
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,690
Ca depends on you.

45
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,720
Shit!

46
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
It is well what I said.

47
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,840
Even not a scratch.
Ca astonishes me nevertheless.

48
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,490
And it is the first time that somebody is raised after I would have démené myself as much.

49
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,720
I suppose.

50
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,350
You never met me front.

51
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:24,800
I included/understood!

52
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,220
It can transform all its body into frayed blade!

53
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,600
There is no secrecy with its technique of sword!

54
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,110
It… This guy…

55
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,510
Fly away!

56
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,770
I involved myself more than whoever…

57
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,480
I was in situations close to dead…

58
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,020
and I always knew to seize the occasion.

59
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,210
Because once I will have beaten you…

60
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,870
I will be the man able to split steel.

61
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,660
None of those which proclaimed epeists were able to scratch me.

62
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,380
What do I miss it?

63
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,020
Sensei!

64
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,760
Sensei!!

65
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,860
I intended to say that there was a man in the world which was able to slice steel!

66
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,820
It is true?

67
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,870
Yes, it is one cannot truer.

68
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,320
You are ready?

69
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,900
Look at this piece of paper attentively.

70
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,740
Sensei, it was pitiful.

71
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,320
Listen well, Zoro.

72
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,810
In the world in which we live,

73
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,180
there are epeists who can nothing slice.

74
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,190
However, these same epeists can also slice steel, or anything else which they wish.

75
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,190
All that with the same saber.

76
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,410
The most powerful blade is that which has the capacity to protect what you wish to protect,

77
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,820
and to slice what you wish to slice.

78
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,940
For me, a sword which wounds all that it touches is not…

79
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,130
… not a sword.

80
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,980
You include/understand?

81
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,490
Sensei! I will become a man who will be able all to slice!

82
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,710
Did Zoro, you listen to me?

83
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,640
I think that it is time that you try to slice me.

84
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,730
To limit you to box my attacks no scratch will cause me.

85
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,680
Afflicted to say that to you,

86
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,390
you will not even on the occasion to testify to my magnificence when I slice steel.

87
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,180
Because when I slice steel,

88
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,250
you will be spread out with my feet.

89
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,910
Obviously.

90
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,010
In this case, I all will slice here,

91
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,710
to the smallest atom!

92
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,080
A sword… which does not cut anything…

93
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,340
Which waste of time.

94
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,510
I all will slice here,

95
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,550
to the smallest atom!

96
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,970
A sword which does not cut anything.

97
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,670
Who does not cut anything…

98
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,010
Who slices steel…

99
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,480
But does brothel, what that want to say?

100
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,640
“Put all your forces there!”

101
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,750
It is the gasoline of a powerful sword!

102
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,720
I will not stop before having reduced to you in parts!

103
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,930
You really start to inflate me.

104
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,540
Similar for you.

105
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,810
Just a small council.

106
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,390
Do not see me like a epeist.

107
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,960
Since I have a multitude of weapons

108
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,850
able to tear your body of pieces.

109
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,460
If are not to you a epeist,

110
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,580
be to you what, an excavator?

111
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,700
An assassin.

112
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,210
Sparks?

113
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,700
But do these tricks move at which speed?

114
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,480
They will break.

115
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,950
A work of excavation would be impossible for me.

116
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,570
I transpierce all that I touch.

117
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,490
Sea…

118
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,670
One moment of carelessness,

119
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,010
and it is death.

120
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,940
You are always in life…

121
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,210
I should not… turn the back to him!

122
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,970
Why beat you with naked hands?

123
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,950
I could not explain it to a dumb in your kind which does not even try to be a epeist.

124
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,670
You would not collect.

125
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,480
Ca does not interest me, in any event.

126
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,660
Die in peace.

127
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,910
Definitely…

128
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,150
I do not have a chance with the rocks today.

129
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,600
The guy!

130
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,170
You ensure that Vivi return well!

131
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,410
One finds oneself with the palate of Alubarna!

132
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,190
I wonder…

133
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,310
if they are always in life…

134
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,320
How can you still hold upright?

135
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,410
With these wounds…

136
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,570
Did you avoid all these rocks which fell?

137
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,530
I avoided… the rocks?

138
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,330
Not!

139
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,460
I knew…

140
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,710
… where they were going to fall.

141
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,740
My katana?

142
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,660
It is under this rock.

143
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,560
I included/understood.

144
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,460
What does it manufacture?

145
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,660
I already felt that before.

146
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,300
The world becomes quiet.

147
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,400
The beat of my heart is like a clap of thunder in my ears.

148
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,530
It must be really that…
to be about to die.

149
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,130
I felt the presence of the rocks when they fell,

150
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,760
as if they were alive…

151
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,700
Not like a presence…

152
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,800
Something of more distinct…

153
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,840
A breath.

154
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,230
The breath of the rocks…

155
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,670
The trees have the breath of the trees…

156
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
And the ground also has to it his…

157
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,890
It is thus that!

158
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,760
Listen well.

159
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,030
In the world in which we live, there are epeists who can nothing slice.

160
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,080
Nothing to slice…

161
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,480
it is to know this breath?

162
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,470
Here is capacity to slice steel.

163
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,120
Dumb! What did you make?

164
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,590
To box these attacks…

165
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,810
To lose as much blood…

166
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,460
You should be dead!

167
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,280
I hear it.

168
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,970
The breath of its steel.

169
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,770
A katana follows the will.

170
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,450
Very well.

171
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,340
I will put an end to your poor wretch life good once for all!

172
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,580
All that it remains to me to do,

173
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,250
it is to see whether I have really the capacity to slice steel.

174
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,490
I cannot believe that you can box my attack with only one saber.

175
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,700
Not engraves.

176
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,940
I will not box them any more.

177
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,410
Then, you finally included/understood.

178
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,180
Very well.

179
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,400
I am grateful to you.

180
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,030
I can become even stronger!

181
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,290
It is true…

182
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,230
Thanks to this combat, it was exceeded…

183
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,930
And after…

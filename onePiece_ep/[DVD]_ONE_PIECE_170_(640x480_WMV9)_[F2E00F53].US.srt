1
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:05,178
Aboard the Going Merry, Nami's team was sailing toward the east coast of upper Yard to escape.

2
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,812
At the same time, on their way to defeat Enel at God's Shrine, the Shandian warroirs encountered Priest Shura.

3
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:19,275
Wiper and Shura clashed in what became a climactic battle!

4
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,090
Why did you throw away your shield and weapon!?

5
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,203
Are you insane!?

6
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:32,789
Don't tell me...

7
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:38,336
You can have it...

8
00:02:38,336 --> 00:02:40,755
if one shoulder is all you want.

9
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,805
An Impact? That's not egough to kill me!

10
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,142
No, 10 times that energy!

11
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,269
REJECT!

12
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:58,731
Wiper! are you trying to kill yourself!?

13
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:02,154
Just try and use the Reject Dial one more time!

14
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,654
You'll blow your body to pieces!

15
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,721
What about my body?

16
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:14,163
Isn't this what you would call resolve?

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,626
If that's all you're thinking about, you'll never beat them!

18
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:27,635
I'm going ahead!

19
00:03:30,886 --> 00:03:33,093
Fine! Do what you want!

20
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,685
But I'll at least pray for everyone's safety!

21
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,523
Okay, guys, watch yourselves!

22
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,692
We'll meet at God's Shrine!

23
00:03:51,824 --> 00:03:54,829
In the Upper yard Survival, currently...

24
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,649
...1 has fallen...

25
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,749
...and 80 remain.

26
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:03,713
I guess they were without divine protection.

27
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:10,928
Meanwhile, the four members of the Straw Hat Pirates' exploration team have also set out.

28
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:15,975
Their objective is to reach the ruins of the ancient city where a fortune in gold resides.

29
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:20,396
From the Sacrificial Altar, they headed directly south.

30
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:24,233
Directly...

31
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,819
...south.

32
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:42,877
FIERCE SKY BATTLE!
PIRATE ZORO VS WARRIOR BRAHAM

33
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,534
Third verse!

34
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,134
Hold it!
The islands in the east~

35
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:51,218
What!?

36
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:53,679
No, I have nothing to say.

37
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,307
And i don't feel like listening to your idiotic prattle.

38
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,352
I'm just going to eliminate you!

39
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,466
What!?

40
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,566
If that's all, you should've said so.

41
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:34,845
The Priests and guerillas here use some strange tactics.

42
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:38,516
I've been at a disadvantage in all of the battles so far.

43
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:45,731
If i have to beat someone from a distance, I have something i can try.

44
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,277
HAWK WAVE

45
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:54,406
That'll work on the second-rate flunkies...

46
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,304
It's not ready yet...

47
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,224
But, I'm going to test it.

48
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,477
The Flying Blade Attack.

49
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,406
No! No, no! Help me!

50
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,285
Leave me alone! Quit chasing me!

51
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:00,097
It's Shandia!

52
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:02,725
It's the Enforcers!

53
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:24,726
I...

54
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:29,126
...shouldn't have come!

55
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,393
The forest is getting a bit unruly.

56
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,230
These appear to be a homes built away from the city.

57
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:53,192
They're being swallowed by the forest as well.

58
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:58,322
I wonder if the city ruins themselves are still intact.

59
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,456
A woman?

60
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:10,720
This route leads to God's Shrine.

61
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,420
Going any farther is forbidden!

62
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,132
Come down from there at once.

63
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:22,721
You have no idea of the historical importance these ruins hold, do you?

64
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:25,099
You dare to sass me?

65
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,102
Do you have something to say? Why are you here?

66
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:38,612
By God's divine word, the Shandians and you Blue Sea dwellers are to be cut down by my Axe Dials!

67
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,033
6 FLOWERS

68
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,246
TWIST!

69
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,176
What a cruel thing to do.

70
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,645
Had enough, Enforcer!?

71
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:16,692
Looks like the others were taken out.

72
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,654
Damn! These Enforcers are becoming a real problem!

73
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:23,699
Go right, go right, go right...

74
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,368
That's one of those Blue Sea dwellers Wiper told us about!

75
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,245
I'll eliminate him!

76
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:33,375
A guerilla?

77
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,253
He means business!

78
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,422
Die!

79
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:41,425
Dunno what your reason is...

80
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,308
What the hell is with you guys?

81
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,563
Please, forgive me!

82
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:57,232
I surrender! I surrender!

83
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,985
I lose Just, please, spare me!

84
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:06,950
Again!?

85
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,330
hey, you! If you're not a priest, then stay out of my way!

86
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,582
I'm in a hurry here!

87
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,024
That bastard...!

88
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,318
What are those shining pistols!?

89
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:44,988
Where'd he go!?

90
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,718
You're a tough nut to crack.

91
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:09,554
Sorry. I've underestimated you, Blue Sea dweller.

92
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,647
Don't worry about it. I should apologize too.

93
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,900
I thought you were just a second-rate flunkie.

94
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,804
He didn't even take a step!

95
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,189
They said there were different types of Wavers.

96
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,859
Are those skate-shoes of his one of them?

97
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,988
He moves his body using gusts of air.

98
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,432
And those pistols of his shine when he fires them!

99
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,537
I keep losing sight of him.

100
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:00,498
Where'd he go?

101
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:09,672
TIGER

102
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,842
Three katana?

103
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:12,468
HUNT

104
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,558
Bastard!

105
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,617
A Blue Sea swordsman who can't use Wavers or Dials...

106
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,078
...will never be able to beat me.

107
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,041
Do you know what this is?

108
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:44,583
What?

109
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:46,670
MILKY DIAL!

110
00:13:51,756 --> 00:13:55,887
Air battles aren't just about jumping from cloud to cloud!

111
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,058
An eel!?

112
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:14,948
If i cooked and basted this guy, he'd make quite a meal.

113
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,971
I screwed up!

114
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:39,889
I'm an idiot!

115
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,853
He's already quick and nimble in battle...

116
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,522
and i let him get my leg!

117
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,986
Right now, I gotta do something about those shining pistols!

118
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:53,987
That's it!

119
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,365
The effectiveness of those guns is pretty exaggerated!

120
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,829
Too bad for you!

121
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,998
Check out these goggles!

122
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:09,627
Your shining pistols won't work on me anymore!

123
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:12,589
Give up while you still can!

124
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:15,467
Those don't look like sunglasses.

125
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:17,302
Busted!

126
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:21,014
Seems you don't like my Flashguns.

127
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:25,477
A swordsman must rely on timing to survive. You can't expect to beat me.

128
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:30,857
I don't know your reasons for coming here.

129
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:37,030
But, as long as you are on this land, you will be considered our enemies.

130
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,824
Now, surrender and die!

131
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:41,910
Your leg must be causing you considerable pain.

132
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:45,788
You make it sound serious.

133
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,079
I let that eel distract me and got myself shot.

134
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:53,379
That proves I still lack concentration.

135
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:58,927
Okay, this looks like a good chance to try that technique.

136
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,137
Should i give it a shot?

137
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:24,369
Running away?

138
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:27,059
Sight.

139
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:27,959
Hearing.

140
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:28,859
Smell.

141
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,759
Taste.

142
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,659
Touch.

143
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,459
Tought.

144
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:33,002
And unto the six mortal senses...

145
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:33,920
Good.

146
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,921
Evil.

147
00:16:34,921 --> 00:16:35,922
Neutrality.

148
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,632
What nonsense is that?

149
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,594
And further unto each, Purity and Corruption.

150
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,597
The 36 earthly desires of this world.

151
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:51,896
I am facing the muzzle of a cannon at you.

152
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:55,066
You are a pistol.

153
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:58,486
In timing and power, my weapon surpasses yours.

154
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,773
You did well, but...

155
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,273
You're going down!

156
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,789
A cannon?

157
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,708
Has he lost his mind?

158
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,793
How could he have a weapon like that?

159
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,005
Have you seen...

160
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:18,715
...the Flying Blade Attack?

161
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,341
What a joke!

162
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,345
ONE-SWORD STYLE

163
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,022
36-POUND CANNON

164
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:54,917
That hurt.

165
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,255
This was nothing personal.

166
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:03,050
I'm not one to die just because someone says so.

167
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:08,848
I'll accept the challenge,

168
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:10,308
Survival.

169
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,336
Damn it...

170
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:44,091
I don't even know where i'm going anymore...

171
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,427
Guys!

172
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:47,303
Luffy!

173
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,289
Zoro!

174
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:49,889
Robin!

175
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:53,657
Maybe i've been standed here to die...

176
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:57,057
I wonder if i'll go to Heaven when i die.

177
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,857
Maybe Doctor is waiting there for me.

178
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,654
No, i can't think about things like that.

179
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:09,617
I'm a doctor! And doctors don't think about dying!

180
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,330
I wonder what kind of place Heaven is...

181
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:16,249
Wait a second.

182
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,084
Isn't this Heaven?

183
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:18,542
Huh?

184
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:23,506
Where did all these ruins come from?

185
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,217
Maybe the others are here!

186
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:28,864
I'm so smart i amaze myself!

187
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,764
Oh, I must be the first one here!

188
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:33,766
It must have been my nose!

189
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:38,187
I'm first!

190
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,232
A tanuki
(raccoon-dog: has shape-shifting powers in japanese folklore)

191
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:47,154
GOMU GOMU NO...

192
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,240
FUUSEN!

193
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,879
That won't work on me!

194
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:10,863
GO

195
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:11,001
GOMU

196
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:11,163
GOMU GO

197
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:11,363
GOMU GOMU

198
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:13,663
GOMU GOMU NO...

199
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,307
FUUSEN! (balloon)

200
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:34,660
Why, you... dirty son of a...

201
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,540
Sanji-kun!

202
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,670
Sanji!

203
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,507
Sanji!

204
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,304
Oi! Sanji-kun!!

205
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:56,056
Hang on, Sanji!

206
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:03,773
W-What's wrong!? C'mon, Sanji!

207
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,157
Hey! I can't hear his heart!

208
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:14,033
It can't be!

209
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,541
A rather foolish man.

210
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:27,963
Even when i hadn't come here to hurt you.

211
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,051
Then why have you come?

212
00:21:33,801 --> 00:21:37,014
What a cold greeting.

213
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,520
It's been six years, hasn't it?

214
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,357
Former God, Gan Fall.

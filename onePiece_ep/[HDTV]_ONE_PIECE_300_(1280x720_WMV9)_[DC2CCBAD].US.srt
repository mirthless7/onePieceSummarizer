00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270
The clouds floating in the cobalt blue,

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,200
Got lost and will soak us all tomorrow.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,080
It'll be fine if you just smile before the sunset.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,420
If it's your wish, you can just

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,080
Say a spell in your chest

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,300
For your hopes...

11
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,560
Our quick premonition

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,430
Is showing in the rainbow colored music notes.

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,820
Won't you come with me?

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,650
We're fallen angels,

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
We'll fire arrows into your dreams.

16
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,560
What color shall we add

17
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,440
Into the cobalt blue?

18
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,490
Destroy the sad reality that reflects in your eyes!

19
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,750
Let's raise our wings, full of warmth!

20
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,710
Surreal fallen angels,

21
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,590
Singing from our hearts.

22
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,270

Kokoro kara utau no sa

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,920
Wealth.

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Fame.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,970
Power.

42
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,960
The man who once owned everything,

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,110
The Pirate King,

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,410
Gold Roger.

45
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,440
The words he said before his death,

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,350
Sent all the people of the world...

47
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,870
Out to the seas.

48
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,750
My treasure?

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,540
If you want it, I'll give it to you!

50
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,240
Find it!

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,840
I left everything in that place.

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,890
Men, searching for romance,

53
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,810
Pushed forward towards the Grand Line.

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,610
The world is now...

55
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,940
In the Grand Age of Pirates!

56
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,140
It's really taken a long time!

57
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,970
But I finally made it!

58
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,820
Once I pass through the gate, I'll be the government's-

59
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,530
No, the world's hero!

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,620
Lucci's here?

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,370
Are you having trouble with him?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,730
Where's Nico Robin?

63
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,330
I brought two of the keys.

64
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,030
You need help?

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,800
No...

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,910
More importantly...

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,770
Please stop Robin!

68
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,120
You can get to the Gate of Justice through the door behind pigeon-guy!

69
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,930
Robin already got taken through!

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,010
I'll take care of him.

71
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,640
Just leave it to me, bastard!

72
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,570
I've made you wait.

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,930
My neck as well as my limbs...

74
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,550
If I can control all of their reaches at will,

75
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,450
I can fight as I like.

76
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm a yontouryuu user!

77
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,440
Yontouryuu: Four-sword style

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,170
Like this, I can use the giraffe's power to its fullest!

79
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,630
You'll have no chance of winning!

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,060
Even if giraffes are the most powerful...

81
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,350
Even if you can fully use that annoying neck...

82
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,730
Even if you are a yontouryuu user...

83
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,150
What?

84
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,140
He stopped my swords?

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,950
You still have no chance of defeating me!

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,050
Fierce God Zoro!

87
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,960
The Incarnation of Asura Shown by his Spirit

88
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,480
How boastful...

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,690
Then show me what you can do!

90
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,760
Santouryuu...

91
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,760
Santouryuu: Three-sword style

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
Hyou...

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,200
Hyou: Leopard

94
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,240
Kin...

95
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,240
Kin: Lute

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,200
He's flying towards me?

97
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,540
Dama!

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,540
Dama: Jewel

99
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,540
How...?

100
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,340
I thought I avoided the attack!

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,980
Don't tell me...

102
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,780
He knew what I was going to do?

103
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,770
What are you so surprised about?

104
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,870
This couldn't have really been the first time you've been hurt.

105
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,740
You really did mean it...

106
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,630
You've truly made me dislike you.

107
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,830
But this is where it ends!

108
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,490
Not only do I have my mastery of rokushiki, I also have the power of a giraffe.

109
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,410
Skill, power, speed.

110
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,670
No matter how you look, there's no way I can lose!

111
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,470
I won't allow you even a moment of relaxation!

112
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,140
Rankyaku Shuriken!

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,110
Kiriman Jaro!

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,110
Kiriman Jaro: Giraffe-man fire oar, also a pun with Mount Kilimanjaro

115
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,030
Shit!

116
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,740
A whip-like neck...

117
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,200
Henchikirin!

118
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,200
Henchikirin: Bamboo whip forest

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,750
Faster!

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,630
Mouchikirin!

121
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,630
Mouchikirin: Fierce bamboo forest

122
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,300
How is it, being hit by numerous attacks?

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,540
And without stopping, four swords!

124
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,850
Prepare yourself!

125
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,890
Gekirin!

126
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,890
Gekirin: Imperial wrath

127
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,190
Here I go.

128
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,700
What a powerful attack...

129
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,630
What's wrong?

130
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,660
Is blocking all you're able to do?

131
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,580
You can't defeat me!

132
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,670
Mere pirates going against the World Government never had a chance!

133
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,930
Everything is worthless compared to justice!

134
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,300
Even that woman!

135
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,400
Bastard...

136
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,920
What? Just now...

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,570
For just a moment, this man looked like a fierce god with three faces and six arms!

138
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,760
What is he?

139
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,890
You got cocky...

140
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,180
And said too much, bastard.

141
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,130
Did I offend you?

142
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,820
Well then...

143
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,810
Using the most powerful rankyaku "amanedachi" that I sliced the tower with...

144
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,860
I'll slice you in two and finish this!

145
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,080
You should give up...

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,460
There's nowhere to run!

147
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,530
This is different from that demonstration before!

148
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,250
Idiot...

149
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,210
You're the one that should give up.

150
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,650
Demonic spirit...

151
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,130
Kyuutouryuu

152
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,130
Kyuutouryuu: Nine-sword style

153
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,070
Asura.

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,930
The demon from before...!

155
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,530
Is he creating illusions with his soul alone?

156
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,490
That's a good try, but you're too late!

157
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,620
You're also the one... that's too late.

158
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,660
You should wait to say those things until after you've avoided the rankyaku!

159
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,330
Amanedachi!

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
The attacks...

161
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,360
He made them disperse?!

162
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,880
You did well.

163
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,610
Suffering is good...

164
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,830
On the path to carnage.

165
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,310
Asura

166
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,760
Ichibugin!

167
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,760
Ichibugin: One Mist Silver

168
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,480
I... have a message from the Galley-La other leader.

169
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,280
If you see those guys... tell them...

170
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,910
You're fired.

171
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,020
I always thought of you guys as my nakama!

172
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,000
Paulie?

173
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,480
Now that's too bad...

174
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,950
They always said that assassins couldn't have any other job...

175
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,400
How about a zoo?

176
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,710
That's great!

177
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,390
Sorry.

178
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,420
Oi, marimo!

179
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,680
Did you get the key?

180
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah...

181
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,160
I just got it.

182
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,380
Really?

183
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,730
But you really overdid it.

184
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,720
The tower slipped again.

185
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,230
Is it really gonna be okay?

186
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,610
Don't even bother talking about it.

187
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,770
It doesn't really matter.

188
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,000
With this we have all the keys.

189
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,010
Yeah.

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,080
Let's hurry and get to Robin.

191
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,090
Run!

192
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,980
Just run!

193
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,560
Full speed ahead!

194
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,520
We need to just not worry 'bout Aniki and the Strawhats!

195
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,940
Run to survive!

196
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,000
Even if you break your legs, keep running!

197
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,730
Run!

198
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,030
We're counting on you, giants!

199
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,780
You guys're just riding, so keep quiet!

200
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,500
I agree!

201
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,100
Go, in the name of Elbaf!

202
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,510
Shut up!

203
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,400
Baachan, faster!

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,760
Hurry, hurry!

205
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,060
Chimney, I'm an old woman!

206
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,710
Be patient!

207
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,520
Well, if I don't drink more, I can't run.

208
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,630
Baachan, he's falling!

209
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,670
Pick him up, pick him up!

210
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,940
Is that an order?

211
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,070
Baachan!

212
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,320
Let's hurry!

213
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,810
We've finally arrived!

214
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,700
I can't stop laughing!

215
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,220
Oi!

216
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,890
Gate of Justice guards!

217
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,180
Is it all ready?!

218
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,130
Yes, it is!

219
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,650
We are waiting for your arrival-

220
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,680
No!

221
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
You're supposed to come out to show your respect!

222
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,190
The hero Spandam-sama just arrived!

223
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,940
Y-yes sir, right away!

224
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,200
Idiots, can't do it right...

225
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,950
Oi, Nico Robin, look at that.

226
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,160
That little gate there's the real entrance.

227
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,960
Once you go through there, it'll be like you crossed from heaven to hell

228
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,920
And that will be the moment that I will go down in history!

229
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,820
Hey hey hey, where do you think you're going?

230
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,690
I really do feel sorry for you...

231
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,260
But there's no choice.

232
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,140
There's no reason for you to live.

233
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,310
Now, for your death.

234
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,390
That bitch!

235
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,060
I don't want to die!

236
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,010
I don't want to die!

237
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,460
I can't die!

238
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,930
Stop acting like this!

239
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,090
Stand up already!

240
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,560
What? I can't get her?

241
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,710
What's going on?

242
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,920
She's holding on with her teeth?!

243
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,060
This woman just doesn't know when to give up, how annoying!

244
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,520
Why the hell are you so stuck on living?!

245
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,250
You're pathetically greedy!

246
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,700
Just what I'd expect from a criminal!

247
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,810
You can't even make people happy by dying!

248
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,920
Why the hell are you still acting like this at the end of everything?!

249
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,740
Dying is so frightening...

250
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,900
I don't want to die...

251
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,470
Save me, everyone!

252
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,630
Luffy!

253
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,560
Shigan...

254
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,150
That won't work!

255
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,060
Ouren!

256
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,060
Ouren: Yellow lotus

257
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,630
Strawhat!

258
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,570
No...

259
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,890
I've gotta worry about getting through that door, fast!

260
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,150
It's no use.

261
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,740
You can't go through here.

262
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,910
Shut up!

263
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,050
Strong...

264
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,710
Tekkai!

265
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,540
Hammer!

266
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,620
What, not even a response?

267
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,990
That attack sent Chapapa flying...

268
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,620
I see.

269
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,010
You defeated Fukurou, then came here?

270
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,430
I'm sorry.

271
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,490
My douriki is...

272
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,490
Five times his.

273
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,160
You did well defeating Fukurou.

274
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,420
Your strength is superhuman as well.

275
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,930
This guy's in a completely different league...!

276
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,690
Now die.

277
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,680
Gomu Gomu no Jet Pistol!

278
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,070
What the hell?!

279
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,650
What's with the smoke?!

280
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,250
Gear Second.

281
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,090
I can't keep it up for too long,

282
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,270
But I'll stop him, so go on ahead!

283
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,070
Franky!

284
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,140
Robin is waiting!

285
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,770
Yosh, Strawhat!

286
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,060
I have no clue what you're doing, but you go beat him!

287
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,830
Didn't I say...

288
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,570
I wouldn't allow that?

289
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,790
You were a devil fruit user too?!

290
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,790
First I'll get rid of you, Franky!

291
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,540
Jet Whip!

292
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,170
Did you forget, Strawhat Luffy?

293
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,730
In this form, I defeated you in a single blow at the Galley-La building.

294
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,430
Yeah, that...

295
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,940
I got better after I ate meat.

296
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:08,820
Soru!

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,530
Shigan!

298
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
Gomu Gomu no...

299
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,240
Tekkai!

300
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,410
Jet Bazooka!

301
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,000
Franky!

302
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,460
Get Robin!

303
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,870
Leave it to me!

304
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,880
You still don't get that it's useless?!

305
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,400
How many times have I told you?!

306
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,230
You don't have any more hopes left!

307
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,550
I can't move from here.

308
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,880
Everyone... is going to come save me!

309
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,860
On the island of snipers...

310
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,970
I was born...

311
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,270
Next time on One Piece:

312
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,470
Spandam's Surprise!

313
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,200
The Hero who Stands on the Tower of Justice

314
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,860
I'm gonna be the pirate king!

1
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:05,650
Alubarna cries!

2
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:05,650
The terrible combat of the Karu Captain!

3
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,590
The hopes of the desperate people are being destroyed by a sand cloud.

4
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,860
Some seek hope, and others try to keep a glimmer of hope.

5
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,400
Their ideas were mislaid, and in confusion, the curtain of the history was closed on a tragedy.

6
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,230
Overlapping the squadron of the Super Mallards,

7
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,150
Zoro and the remainder of the crew attracted with far Number Agents from Works Baroque.

8
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,970
Incrédule, Vivi was drawn up in front of Kohza to stop its attack.

9
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,670
But words of Vivi…

10
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,950
… lost themselves in a sand cloud.

11
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
The rebellious army encircled Alubarna…

12
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,860
… and the royal army which protects Alubarna from now on made speak the weapons…

13
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,140
… and the rebellion started!

14
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,000
Vivi-Chan is in danger!

15
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,020
Usopp, will give a knack To be pinched.

16
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,550
Chopper?

17
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,770
Goes at the entry to South-east!

18
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,550
Eh? Of agreement…

19
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,040
Vivi-Chan…

20
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,560
Hold good!

21
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,280
Time that I arrive!

22
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,280
A rebel!

23
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,300
It is over there behind!

24
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,270
A rebel!?

25
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,630
It is of me that he speaks?

26
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,730
A soldier of the royal army!

27
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,310
Descend it!

28
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,440
He, He. I am neither a rebel nor a soldier.

29
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,760
I am the allied one of a Lady!

30
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,300
The South-eastern entry of Alubarna

31
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,040
These deux-là…

32
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
They disappeared…

33
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,240
Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas.

34
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,310
Where did they pass?

35
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,430
Q- What do they make?

36
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,480
Good blood, that are they?

37
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,720
Not, what you are you?

38
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I find that you speak much.

39
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,160
Well, lets to me present to you…

40
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
… our N°4 beater.

41
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,570
N°4…

42
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,920
… a beater.

43
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
What I can make…

44
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,610
I must do all that is in my capacity!

45
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,890
I am…

46
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,850
I am a pirate!

47
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,080
Burst!

48
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,730
Princess Vivi!

49
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,490
The desert will be your…

50
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,780
… TOMB!

51
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,310
Karu!

52
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,560
Afflicting…

53
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,620
But…

54
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,660
You will not escape to me!

55
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,290
I said that you will not escape to me…!

56
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,810
Ca is enough, stop you…!

57
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,460
I will absorb you…!
Both!

58
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,970
Karu…

59
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,480
You protected me…

60
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,800
But now…
You are with end of force…

61
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,620
Not! If one goes straight, one will be made trap in the staircases!

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,940
Do not complicate the things!
Stop running!

63
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,910
Let go down to me, Karu!

64
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,710
I will fight it, then…

65
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,500
Wait one minute, it is the cliff…!

66
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,520
Hein? He will not dare!

67
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,030
What does it occur!?

68
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,030
This dirty duck goes up to the plate of Alubarna!

69
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,940
Imbeciles!

70
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,450
Now go down until me and undergo my Kenpo Ballet!

71
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,770
This is the proof that we are companions!

72
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,130
Why do you cry, Karu?

73
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,230
You can count on us!

74
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,080
Vivi is our companion!

75
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,720
What…!?

76
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,960
Karu, you are incredible!

77
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,260
You flew!

78
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,200
Now that one is all in top, I am persuaded that Mr. 2 will not be able…

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,010
What a impertinence…!

80
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,810
Salt duck!

81
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,500
Nothing is impossible for me!

82
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,140
I poured blood, sweat and tears to improve my…

83
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,060
Statement!

84
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,070
Karu, will you have the force to cross this battle field?

85
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,010
I will never find Kohza in the middle of this battle.

86
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,770
We will seek Chaka to the palate,

87
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,850
before the rebellious army does not reach the heart of the city…

88
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,670
I rattrapééééés you!

89
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,270
A STRAY BULLET…!

90
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,680
KARU!

91
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Vivi is our companion!

92
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,360
It is useless!

93
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,240
Karu…!

94
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,850
KARU!!

95
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,390
I had said to you that it was useless!

96
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,760
I include/understand…

97
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,510
Be to you a true poison!

98
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,560
I also will finish some with you!

99
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,360
DECREE!

100
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,730
Poison-poison-poisons!

101
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,910
Poison-poisons…

102
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
It is you…

103
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,230
You managed well, Capitaine Karu.

104
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,850
You behave as a man.

105
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,340
Sanji-San!

106
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,550
The guy, you can also ravel you.

107
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,920
You want to always stop the rebellion, not true Vivi-Chan?

108
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,680
I will deal with him!

109
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,820
It is you?

110
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,250
That which makes all these whores of merdic imitations.

111
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,480
Remain with the variation.

112
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Who? Who are you thus?

113
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,010
Leave.

114
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,450
I entrust Karu to you.

115
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,860
Ahh! It is escaping to me!

116
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,660
Stop to you foutre of me!

117
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,740
You will die!

118
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,410
You took the invaluable glasses of tireur d'élite of a friend…

119
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,660
… and I you will take them again!

120
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,730
What?

121
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,620
I am not as weak as him.

122
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,950
Would you be one of the companions of Straw hat?

123
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,570
Would you be by chance infamous Mr. Prince?

124
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,580
Whole.

125
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,900
I am called Sanji.

126
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,190
The best cook of the seas.

127
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,090
A cook!?

128
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,160
I am good also!

129
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,880
Now, why a cook would be caught some with an criminal organization!?

130
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,450
I form also part of an criminal organization.

131
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,090
I am at the same time a cook and a pirate.

132
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,890
“Eye for eye”?

133
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,170
Exactly.

134
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,360
Remove your dirty legs of this country.

135
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,620
Western district

136
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,450
Go ahead! Go ahead Zoro!

137
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,650
Good blood but what do you wait!?

138
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,650
Go ahead and cleans the ground with their heads!

139
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,650
Close to it good blood, and will put yourself at the shelter!

140
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,590
I hope that you will divert me a little the guy.

141
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,090
Catches them, Zoro!

142
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,990
You do not have an other choice, not true?

143
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,170
Magne of the ass…

144
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,550
… to antir…

145
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,480
… these dreadful gorillas…

146
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,970
What are you in the train of mijoter?

147
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,980
Hein!?

148
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,180
First rule to assassinate:

149
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,100
To always occupy itself in first of the weakest target.

150
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Observe how the pros operate.

151
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,220
M- Me?

152
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,970
A- Wait one second.

153
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,570
There is really no reason to kill me.

154
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,900
My face and my style are the best in the world but…

155
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,280
… I donot can fight.

156
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,920
Eh well it is as had said we.

157
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,850
To start with people as is to you the fastest manner to finish some.

158
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,330
I see what you want to say!

159
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
Of course, of course that you are right!

160
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,910
I would make the same thing!

161
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,120
I had said to you to close it and to put yourself at the shelter.

162
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,580
Ca must be the entry of the South-east about which Sanji spoke.

163
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,420
It would be said that the battle is finished…

164
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,470
Where is Chopper?

165
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,530
Chopper!

166
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,380
Eh, Chopper!

167
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,300
Hold good!

168
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,980
He! He!

169
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,740
Usopp…

170
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,740
I am happy that you are well.

171
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,230
Would not be stupid!

172
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,970
You are wounded?

173
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,480
Nothing serious.

174
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,520
Then?

175
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,080
Mr.4 and its binomial are flee?

176
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,130
And just when I came to lend strong hand to you!

177
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,310
It is really not chance, hein!?

178
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,520
I was going to show you how the Master of the seas,

179
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,630
largest of all the heroes, the Usopp-Sama Captain fights!

180
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,520
They are always there, some share.

181
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,320
Take guard.

182
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
WHAT!?

183
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,030
Why you did not say it earlier!?

184
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,540
What…?

185
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,280
I do not see anybody…

186
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,490
They are under ground.

187
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,550
Mogu = Mole

188
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,550
Miss Merry Christmas has the capacities of a mole since she ate the Fruit of the Demon Mogu Mogu.

189
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,790
A human mole?

190
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,820
The other, Mr. 4 is a N°4 beater.

191
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,630
Moreover, it has its dog with him.

192
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,130
Hein? I did not include/understand anything of the whole.

193
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,220
About what you do speak?

194
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,790
Here it is!

195
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,660
BEND DOWN!

196
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,540
You are well, Usopp?

197
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,930
You saved me!

198
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,070
Thank you.

199
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,380
Was good blood what it?

200
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,460
N°4 beater = most extremely of the beaters on the bench is the fourth beater

201
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,460
I said to you that Mr. 4 was a N°4 beater.

202
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,670
Moreover, it has its dog with him.

203
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,490
And I said to you that I did not have any idea of what you told.

204
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,250
Ah! Here it is!

205
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,350
A dog.

206
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,760
Good blood, it is what this trick!?

207
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,740
The favorite weapon of Mr. 4:Lasso the dog rifle

208
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,740
(It is caught cold)

209
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,970
Caution!

210
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,410
Q- What!?

211
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,530
WHAT!?

212
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,930
Ca arrives!

213
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,720
STILL!?

214
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
You must move away some!

215
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,650
USOPP!

216
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,900
Usopp!

217
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,140
You are well!?

218
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:41,960
Usopp!

219
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,090
I go you redemander.

220
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,630
Good blood, it is what this trick?

221
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,190
It is bombes à retardement.

222
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,540
Even if they are not touched, they explode nevertheless.

223
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,740
They calculate exact time that it is necessary to send the ball to us.

224
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,340
No matter what it arrives, they will explode nevertheless.

225
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,090
I thought of being able to stop one and to start again it of them like a counter-attack.

226
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,780
But these balls are as heavy as boulets de canon.

227
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,850
It is possible no to stop them.

228
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,810
To be able to strike them with its beater with as much speed,

229
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,550
the arms of Mr. 4 must have a superhuman force.

230
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,880
L---has---S---S---O--- !

231
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,210
But which kind of beater it uses?

232
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,870
L---has---

233
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,870
Eh, Mr. 4! Mr. 4!

234
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,530
Molasse species.

235
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,720
Not! Not!

236
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,130
What you made with glander there!?

237
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,570
Magnez you to botch them!

238
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,650
Destroy them! Destroy them!

239
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,370
Destroy them! Destroy them!

240
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,920
He! You! Then! Ho!

241
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,350
You are really only one molasse! A molasse!

242
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,440
Ba (Baka) = Stunned

243
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,440
Ba! Be to you a Ba!

244
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,930
There! The human mole!

245
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,700
A MOLE!

246
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,150
I AM NOT TRANSFORMED YET!

247
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,420
BA! You ES a BA!

248
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,260
Chopper, you occupy yourself some.

249
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,100
Will you throw ash my body wounded with the sea?

250
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,540
YOU SAID THAT YOU CAME TO LEND STRONG HAND TO ME, MORON.

251
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,010
Listen well!

252
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,530
What is it that this dog initially!?

253
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,980
How do you want that I fight against these monsters!?

254
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,590
I am only one human! You measuring rods!?

255
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,520
I am also human!

256
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,410
Not, imbecile, you are a monster!

257
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,770
Eh well looks at a little the length of your nose!

258
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,620
Close it, blue nose!

259
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,440
You initially, long nose!

260
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,880
You really believe that it is the moment of you chamailler, hein!?

261
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,440
Afflicted…

262
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,290
The name of this thing is Lasso.

263
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,140
Inu = Dog

264
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,140
It is a weapon which ate the Fruit of the Demon Inu Inu.

265
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,350
A weapon!?

266
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,910
A weapon which ate a Fruit of the Demon?

267
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,350
It is a novel method coming from Large Line.

268
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,870
Even objects can eat a Fruit of the Demon!

269
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,160
Balivernes!

270
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,910
How can it move if it is a weapon!?

271
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,040
The Fruit of the Demon cannot in no case to give him this faculty!

272
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,480
And how the weapon did can eat this fruit initially!?

273
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,870
Oh closes it!

274
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,920
What good is knowledge since you will die!?

275
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,080
It moves and it is all!

276
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,660
Ba!

277
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,380
Ba species!

278
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,790
Ba!

279
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,600
It is not true, Mr. 4?

280
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,820
O--U--has--I--S--

281
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,770
You have measuring rod?

282
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,860
You will not set out again from here alive.

283
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,180
You put the feet on our territory!

284
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,870
Have fun!

285
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,400
Our territory appoints the taupinière of the 4th Avenue!

286
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,120
It is transformed into human mole!

287
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,750
A penguin?

288
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,790
I AM A MOLE, SPECIES OF BA!

289
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,500
It left under ground!

290
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Yosh!

291
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,150
IT IS TIME SE TO BREAK!

292
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,160
WAIT!

293
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,040
I let to you occupy myself some!

294
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,840
Caution!

295
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,540
It arrives by there!

296
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,660
It is a curved ball!

297
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:10,920
NOT!

298
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,120
Above you, Usopp!

299
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,160
A FLOATING BALL!

300
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,990
Ah! Well, well!

301
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,480
I suppose that Mr. 4 does not have a good average of striking!

302
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,870
I can dodge it without problem!

303
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,040
A Spin!

304
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,040
Spin = an effect

305
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,370
Attention behind you!

306
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,530
It is not normal, the N°4 beater should always be called Mr. 4.

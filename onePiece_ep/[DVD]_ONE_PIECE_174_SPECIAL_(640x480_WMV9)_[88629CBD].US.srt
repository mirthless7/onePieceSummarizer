You are protected!

4
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:21,085
You knew that at the end of the ocean, there is a fabulous treasure?

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,885
That which will find it will become the Lord of the Pirates!

6
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:25,315
It is really exciting!

7
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,365
More the great adventure of all times is in front of us.

8
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:32,835
Good voyage!

And you will see the way towards
future to trace itself in front of you.

11
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:54,015
The tern horizon that everyone described.

12
00:00:54,015 --> 00:01:01,265
You will be able to see it in your telescope.

13
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:10,465
The compass which scatters your life and your heart.

Now you it controls easily.

15
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:15,675
Good voyage!

16
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:20,675
Give up handicap them and the past.

17
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:27,645
So that we all can laugh together.

18
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:35,445
Stinginess not on the tears
that you make run for your dreams.

19
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:41,555
It is the most invaluable thing of my life.

20
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:50,295
And you will see the way towards
future to trace itself in front of you.

21
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:05,505

can nothing see, with share the dreams.

23
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:50,375
Extraordinary poursuiveurs of dreams

24
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:54,305
do not see the power.

25
00:44:53,295 --> 00:45:02,255
The affection is not necessary…
Go from before with the smile.

26
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:11,225
The significance of the family I believe that looks at you!

00:45:11,495 --> 00:45:20,735
Whether you are hungry or that you cry,
I will always give you a knack.

The best friend is always the best.

29
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:37,455
Not only knowledge, not only friends.

30
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:41,025
We are a family.

31
00:45:41,195 --> 00:45:46,005
Not only our close relations or our brothers.

32
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:50,045
We are a family.

33
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:02,085
It is unforgivable.

34
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:05,905
I will not save to you.

35
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:13,865
I will put my life concerned until you,
dirty pirates, be destroyed.

dirty pirates, be destroyed!

42
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:47,225
Until you,
dirty pirates, be destroyed!

43
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,905
Go, go, you all!

44
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:12,465
The most popular drama played by the troop of Randolph.

45
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:15,385

00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:19,015

Go, celebrates it heroic actor Randolph soon will leave the scene.

50
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:32,615
It is its last representation!

51
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:34,015
Randolph?

52
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,305
You do not know Randolph?

53
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,035
It will stop its career.
It is him?

54
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,035
Randolph is the best.

55
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:46,205
I am impatient, that must make 8 or 10 years
that it did not come on this island.

56
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,305
Me too.
I am so content.

57
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:49,875
Super! Randolph!

58
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:51,985
All that with the very interesting air.

59
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:53,155
Which part?

60
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:55,535
The whole ship will be used as theater.

61
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,565
It is not common!

62
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:58,035
He! Which part?

63
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:00,135
There remains to us still time before taking again the sea.

64
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:02,255
Some tickets, that is not so much expensive.

65
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:04,655
I require of you of which part it acts?

66
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:06,065
He. Do not make any you, Chopper.

67
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:07,675
You will see well. Allons-y.

68
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:16,035
Super. Here!

69
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:19,415
Wait!
It is not started yet.

70
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:20,825
You listen to me?

71
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:23,535
, You all wait!!

72
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,925
This place with the really interesting air.

73
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,605
He. There is something here.

74
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,195
Qu… What?

75
00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:31,185
He, you!

76
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:34,355
Where you go? The entry is not here!

77
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,945
It is…

78
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:41,015
, You wait…

79
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,565
Its name is Usopp and a day it will save the world!

80
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:47,865
Its heroic history will start!

81
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:53,475
Ah. Finally… You could to at least say something them, Sanji-Kun.

82
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:57,635
Ah yes, it is true.
I should say something.

83
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,485
It is what the problem?

84
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,945
Even you…

85
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,235
Kill it! Kill it!

86
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,605
What is there?

87
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:20,425
What? Wouldn't it be to better go to help it?

88
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,765
Silence! The part started.

89
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:28,095
Finally you will pay for what you did!

90
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:29,505
It is finished for you!

91
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:34,425
You have committed all these crimes and
transformed the world into a true hell.

92
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:35,555
It is unforgivable!

93
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:39,715
I will not save to you!

94
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:46,565
I will put my life concerned until you,
dirty pirates, be destroyed!

95
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:49,615
Well, well. It is finished, it is finished.

96
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,715
Which is all this stir whereas
didn't the part start yet?

97
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:54,805
That is enough like that.
That is enough like that.

98
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,255
Let us make a small pause.

99
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:58,225
Yes!

100
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:04,125
We will put at it all our heart for your last representation, Randolph-San.

101
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:08,815
Let us make so that it is most unforgettable of the representations for Randolph-San!

102
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:09,845
Ouais!

103
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,195
Made as usual.

104
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:19,175
Even if I take my retirement today,
you must continue the representations.

105
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:24,025
From tomorrow… will make we the representations without you, Randolph-San.

106
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:28,965
Do not make this head!
It is not the face of a large pirate.

107
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,835
Afflicted, it is a coincidence.

108
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,325
I decided to leave the boat.

109
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,535
I drop the role from heroin.
I have enough of it.

110
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:41,985
Qu… What? You leashes to fall?

111
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,405
To be the heroin of a poor troop,
that does not bring back anything.

112
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,545
To make representations on the open sea stormy…

113
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:52,425
Why a famous actress as me should do it?

114
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:56,245
You… You pleasant, not?
The representation begins in 30 minutes.

115
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,895
Without you, the representation of today will be…

116
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:03,275
I am not the only one to have remonstrances in connection with this troop with the reduction.

117
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,345
You…

118
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:09,945
Goodbye, Randolph.

119
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:13,355
Att… Wait… Listen to me… Return…

120
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:16,885
Leave, that often arrives them this starting kind.

121
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:21,195
Why are you so indifferent? What will become the troop with 3 people in less?

122
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:24,525
Without actress, who will play the part of the Princess?

123
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,935
The representation will be a fiasco if they do not return.

124
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:31,465
Let take his place to me.

125
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:37,295
But I want wages of 100.000 Berrys.
What do you say some? It is given, not?

126
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:43,885
You do not need an actress?

127
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,585
100.000 Berrys. Is that appropriate to you?

128
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:58,355
Absolutely. No problem.

129
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:01,175
Ah! Me too! Me too!

130
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,985
Let play to me!

131
00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:04,145
You need 3 people, not?

132
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,785
Then, me too.
I want to be an actor since my childhood.

133
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,305
I want a chance.

134
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,325
Who are you and from which you come?

135
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,325
Of made you not.
They are my friends.

136
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:13,895
Who asked you to answer you??

137
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:17,535
Throw an eye with script if you have a trou de mémoire.

138
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:18,805
It is script?

139
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:22,145
Yes, I must rewrite appearances on stage and the dialogs for you.

140
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,395
From today, you belonged to the troop.

141
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:25,655
Thank you very much for your assistance.

142
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:28,665
In this case, add my lines.

143
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:29,855
Mine too!

144
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:30,775
The null ones…

145
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,475
I do not want to give me in spectacle.

146
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:33,665
Here are which is very interesting.

147
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,195
Do you… you also want…

148
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,995
Ouais! I am a too good actress.

149
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,005
It is a joke?

150
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:40,285
Robin-Chan!!

151
00:08:40,505 --> 00:08:44,255
Then me also I want! Give me a role!

152
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:45,955
How you will want!

153
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:46,585
Ball…

154
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,885
A long time ago… very very a long time…

155
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:34,865
in a South Sea remote, very remote,

156
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:39,195
a calm small island and without history was.

157
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,145
He! Dispatch you to return after having said your text.

158
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:53,535
… a calm small island and without history was.

159
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:55,295
Here!

160
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,055
… an small island cal was…

161
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:07,155
Let turn over to me on scene!
The public claims me!

162
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,685
Is necessary that I await the signal before making it turn.

163
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:15,355
It is what?

164
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:21,025
Oh! The Princess. The Princess arrives.

165
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:22,245
Princess!

166
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:25,185
It is very heavy.

167
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,145
Hello with all!

168
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,225
We summons charm to accommodate you.

169
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:34,155
Wahou! The Princess is delightful!

170
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:39,465
The sun of the morning seems quite pale beside its splendor.

171
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,695
But it is what this play of actor, Robin?

172
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:43,985
It does what?

173
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,325
He, He!

174
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:51,725
Princess, I am the Captain of this island.

175
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,295
Ah not not,
I am not prestigious.

176
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:54,105
The farm!

177
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,715
Pirates! The pirates arrive!!

178
00:10:56,715 --> 00:10:58,045
It is the truth!

179
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:01,685
The pirates attack the island in this moment!

180
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,305
It is soon to the large Baran pirate to enter in scene.

181
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:09,055
He, hurries!

182
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:11,675
Ah, euh… Red… Red.

183
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:15,395
The large pirate responsible for all these misdeeds,
it is me Baran!

184
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:19,395
I will strip you of all your treasures
and all to massacre you!

185
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:22,455
Pirates!

186
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:24,175
The pirates arrive!

187
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:26,255
… on the princess, by holding up the sword.

188
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,955
Princess. Die!

189
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,335
Princess… You are wounded?

190
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:35,545
What you made?

191
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,555
Ah. the Help!!

192
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,535
Stop!!

193
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,535
He! What you factories?

194
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:50,845
To kill! To kill!

195
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,525
What does it occur? Did I die?

196
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,925
Why the scenario changed as much?

197
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:57,455
Species of dumb! What you made ace with Nami-San?

198
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,565
Ah! This world…

199
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:09,055
Wait! You of made too much.

200
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:12,185
I play the comedy, not?

201
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:13,705
You believe yourselves in an opera?

202
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:16,495
Oh? I was wrong?

203
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:21,245
It is panic in all the village
when the pirates make rage.

204
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:25,835
Is there something of worse than that in this world?

205
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:27,385
Ah. My God…

206
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:29,475
That is used for nothing if it is a tragedy like the others.

207
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:30,475
Excuse me.

208
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,655
But… Wait. Now…

209
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,625
It is not my role.

210
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,225
But, what you cards?

211
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:41,065
Euh…

212
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,365
There is a monkey in the scenario?

213
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:45,425
Ah! The costume was in the slides.

214
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:47,085
Do not play anyhow.

215
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:51,805
It is interesting?

216
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:52,965
Well. Still a little.

217
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,605
I want to say…

218
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:00,415
It is the signal?

219
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,305
What does it occur?

220
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,055
It is what this brothel?

221
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,735
Deaths are running.

222
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:22,835
The village sank in darkness as in a tragedy.

223
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:25,595
What a waste!

224
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,185
The calm one.

225
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:32,675
The calm one.

226
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,205
You calm all.

227
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:39,035
I am the Major of the Marly Marine.

228
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:41,125
That made a long time that we wait.

229
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,255
Randolph.

230
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:44,755
Species of dirty refuse of pirates.

231
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:48,725
You transformed this splendid island into a cruel abyssal zone.

232
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,105
It is unforgivable.

233
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:51,955
Upright, villager!

234
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:56,105
You whose family and friends were killed,
you must continue to live!

235
00:13:57,165 --> 00:14:01,995
No pirate can take our thirst for living to us!

236
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:08,825
Let beat this refuse in the name of Justice to me.

237
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,025
Wahou! This Randolph…

238
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:38,345
By looking at it, I feel courageous.

239
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,545
It is soon the second act.
It is its best performance.

240
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:42,415
Ouais.

241
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:43,665
What is there?

242
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:45,565
It is what these boats?

243
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,905
That it was spectacle!

244
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,615
I feel really happy.

245
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,255
Why my role is finished?

246
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:59,805
Then, it is the second act. What will it occur?

247
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,975
Randolph-San beats the pirates at the end.

248
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:06,065
It is the end when the pirates are overcome?

249
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:08,795
What? Is the Navy there only to return justice?

250
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:11,755
This end is really null!

251
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,175
It is shitting!

252
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:14,975
Nothing there can.

253
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:18,065
In any event, Randolph-San was Major in the Navy.

254
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:19,625
Major in the Navy?

255
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:25,665
When one thinks of it, it joined the Navy because its family was killed by pirates.

256
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,145
By pirates?

257
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:33,025
Randolph-San comes from a family of actors, but they were attacked by pirates

258
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:36,045
and they were massacred.

259
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:40,625
All except Randolph-San which fled.
He joined the Navy.

260
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:46,995
After the capture of the pirates who killed his family, it was promoted Major.

261
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:52,375
Then, it is become again actor in order to encourage all those of which

262
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,965
the family had been killed by pirates just like him.

263
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,245
From one island to another, he encouraged many people.

264
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:04,275
Those whose moral one was with lowest began again
courage after having seen our representations.

265
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:07,945
It is what Randolph-San always said us, then we remain with him.

266
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:10,985
We are not afraid
even if the sea is unchained.

267
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:13,045
But… Irony of fate,

268
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:17,295
Randolph-San was seriously wounded when
it was attacked by these pirates.

269
00:16:18,015 --> 00:16:22,335
That becomes increasingly hard for him to speak. And that worsens with time.

270
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:26,545
In spite of that, it satisfies so much the spectators whom they notice nothing.

271
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:28,035
It reached its limit.

272
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:31,725
There is not any doubt that one day he will not be able to produce the least sound any more.

273
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,035
And it is for that it must take its retirement.

274
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:39,395
Randolph. Great news!

275
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,035
They are pirates!

276
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:41,975
What?

277
00:16:42,185 --> 00:16:46,855
The crew of the pirate to the Straw hat, Monkey D. Luffy.

278
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,205
Does Pépé, it remain still bento?

279
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:56,815
They is very good.

280
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:07,025
What do you want? Blasted pirates!

281
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,445
The pirates kill people like animals!

282
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,275
They betray their companions,
and make them lose any hope!

283
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:18,555
In fact refuse of the worst species does not deserve to live!

284
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:19,555
Refuse?

285
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:22,255
The pirates are not all like that.

286
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:25,685
In what concerns us,
we are adventurers of the sea.

287
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:27,565
The refuse does not have the right to speak about the ocean.

288
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,355
What?

289
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:29,175
Wait!

290
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:39,385
I undertake this old wreck.

291
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:46,045
You want to fight?

292
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:49,615
I will burst you.

293
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,745
Randolph, stops. You will die.

294
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:55,495
There is a reward of 100 million Berrys for this type.

295
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,165
100… 100 million Berrys?

296
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:02,015
Hum… The amount of the reward
no relationship with the force has.

297
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:05,435
It left!!

298
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:14,995
It does not manage too badly, the old man.

299
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,865
Then it is a former Major of the Navy…

300
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:19,625
But it is not in good health, not?

301
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,325
Which is this force?
Completely different from that from before…

302
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,865
Go, Randolph-San!!

303
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:27,795
Go!

304
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,045
Randolph-San!

305
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,285
You scratched me. Do not make the malignant one!

306
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:43,715
Not my kind.

307
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:46,995
But I cannot fight thoroughly against you.

308
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:50,895
Here me is!

309
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,225
Ah. Of the bento!

310
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,395
Doesn't that go, not?

311
00:18:58,395 --> 00:18:59,465
What a blow salts!

312
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:05,035
You gained ace, I am irritated now.

313
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:10,575
He ate a Fruit of the Demon?

314
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,495
It is not my fault…

315
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,165
Do not be to you well?

316
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:28,675
Randolph!

317
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:29,675
Randolph-San!

318
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:33,045
That goes. It is nothing.

319
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,645
You can nevertheless go up on scene?

320
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:37,635
Not. It is not the moment for that.

321
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,865
It is the hour of the lever de rideau.

322
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,305
Ouais, the spectators wait.

323
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,815
Kid, remains here until the end of the representation.

324
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:48,915
Our combat was not finished.

325
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:52,355
One will finish it after the representation.

326
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,675
Very well.

327
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:56,755
Why you remainders planted there?

328
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,985
Repair the scene, quickly.
It is soon the hour of the lever de rideau…

329
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,235
Randolph-San!

330
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:03,555
All is well, it is right small a giddiness.

331
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:05,045
All is well.

332
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:09,985
Doesn't He, why that start?

333
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:11,515
It is the hour.

334
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,165
You are sure that goes, Randolph-San?

335
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:21,145
Not possible. Do we have to cancel the representation?

336
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:24,915
Impossible! Today, it is the last
representation of Randolph-San.

337
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:26,735
All is of your fault!

338
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:32,865
It cannot go up on scene for the representation. Luffy, it is your fault with 250%!!

339
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,035
Species of dumb.

340
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:38,515
Are Nami, why to you on their side whereas he threatens the pirates?

341
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:44,565
The pirates are refuse.

342
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:46,795
It is also what I thought front.

343
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:50,375
The pirates betray even their companions.

344
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,185
They make them lose any hope.

345
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:54,585
It is unforgivable.

346
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:56,835
I always thought that.

347
00:20:57,565 --> 00:21:00,325
Just like Randolph whose family was killed by pirates.

348
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,795
But, there is a difference.

349
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:10,145
Randolph forever met the crew
of the pirate to the Straw hat.

350
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:15,375
What a bad counterparts!

351
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:17,325
You are caught for the first feminine role?

352
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:17,975
What?

353
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:20,195
Nami-San is perfect.

354
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,685
You can nothing say of other that?

355
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:24,315
Love! Love! Love!

356
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:23,625
The farm!

357
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:31,495
Navy!

358
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:32,155
Navy?

359
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,355
That is enough for the warnings.

360
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,595
Here is finally so much awaited moment.

361
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,605
You are Randolph?

362
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:54,765
Yes.

363
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:56,435
We are there to stop you.

364
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:58,105
To stop?

365
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:03,385
That made of the years that you resell with the pirates
weapons flights with the Navy,

366
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:07,695
whereas you claim to travel of share the world
for your representations.

367
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:09,475
About what you do speak?

368
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,305
It is true? You have evidence?

369
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,305
We found that in the reserve.

370
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:18,825
There are many weapons flights by pirates.

371
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:21,385
Impossible. How did this arrive there?

372
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:22,595
Pass to him the shackles.

373
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:25,345
What does it occur?

374
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,755
He, await Lieutenant.

375
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,285
Prepare you to excavate the places.

376
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:29,865
It is impossible.

377
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,195
What does one make for the representation?
It is the last!

378
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:33,835
What do you manufacture?

379
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:36,025
We do not have anything to see in it.

380
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:39,215
He! Wait, Officiers!

381
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:42,105
Do not take along the old man.

382
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:43,865
The representation is not finished!

383
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:47,645
And then one must finish our baston afterwards!

384
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,195
Who are you?

385
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:50,205
I am a pirate.

386
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,205
Would not be so frank!!!

387
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,285
One pi… pirate?

388
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:56,785
Not not!!
He plays the part of a pirate.

389
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,045
What? It is anything.

390
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,915
Hein? Pay to or I burst you!

391
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:02,795
Interfere yourself your business.

392
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:06,205
I return after me to be explained with the Lieutenant.

393
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:11,065
The spectacle must continue, for the public which awaits me.

394
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,285
Take it along.

395
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,145
You really believe that you will return?

396
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:24,505
Nobody has the right to show innocent.

397
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,345
Randolph.

398
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:30,445
We all know it,
you did not do anything of evil!

399
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:32,535
Return quickly, please!

400
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,465
I want to see the end of the spectacle.

401
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,995
Especially the scene where Randolph re-silvers the malicious ones.

402
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:43,465
I feel extremely and courageous by looking at you playing on scene.

403
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:45,145
Me too.

404
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:47,015
We all here think we it.

405
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:49,585
I count on you. Return, Randolph!!

406
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,545
Randolph!!

407
00:24:15,155 --> 00:24:18,815
That made a lease, Randolph,
former Major of the Navy.

408
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:21,735
Gabana, then it is you.

409
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,355
Your former subordinate,
it is what I was front.

410
00:24:24,405 --> 00:24:28,795
But as you can note it,
I am Major now.

411
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,985
At all events, I exceeded you.

412
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:36,315
At all events… At all events.

413
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:46,135
Incredible, Gabana, you are incredible.

414
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,905
One day, I will exceed this man

415
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,595
and I will obtain all the honors.

416
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:55,415
I will reach the top and I will become leading dazzling.

417
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,655
It is for that I must save,

418
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,075
to use my brain

419
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:00,035
and money.

420
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:03,475
To use the money to bribe an officer in order to obtain more to be able.

421
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:05,445
The money can all buy.

422
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:07,375
It is the rule in the world.

423
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:18,415
Gabana.

424
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,675
What do you say?
Major Randolph…

425
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:27,825
Your friend disappeared.

426
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,315
And then?

427
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,405
Did Gabana, you kill it?

428
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:38,445
You flew our arm, and you resold them with our enemies, the pirates.

429
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,385
It was a good lucky find!
And not that once.

430
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:43,205
You have evidence?

431
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:47,365
We did not can anything find in spite of our excavations.

432
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,885
You really played very well.
However…

433
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:54,685
Isn't your attitude now a proof in itself?

434
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:59,035
I will send to you in cour martiale.

435
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:03,545
You believe that will be accepted?
Without evidence?

436
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,845
I have nothing to do with Randolph.

437
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:09,415
Nobody can declare me guilty.
I will be avenged one day.

438
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,605
One day I will be avenged.
I will send to you in hell.

439
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:15,065
I will do it.

440
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,945
30 years ago, I passed in cour martiale.

441
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:29,735
After a very long lawsuit, I was declared innocent for lack of evidence.

442
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:34,105
In same time, that very strongly slowed down my career.

443
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,315
Otherwise, I will have assembled the levels much more quickly.

444
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:41,495
I arrived there thanks to my intelligence,

445
00:26:41,705 --> 00:26:44,125
stage by stage… How it was long!

446
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:48,505
Because of you, that took 30 years to me to arrive at the rank of Major.

447
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:53,215
In this case, how long is it necessary to reach the top?

448
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,405
Randolph. All is of your fault.

449
00:26:58,025 --> 00:26:59,435
You very wasted.

450
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,865
It is not rather because of your incompetence?

451
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:07,625
Who are you? From which do you come?

452
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,325
You take to me for whom?
I am Major in the Navy.

453
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:12,265
You resemble an idiot.

454
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:14,825
An idiot?

455
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,665
Species of dumb!

456
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:25,725
I have sufficient evidence this time.

457
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:29,895
You…

458
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,145
Exactly.

459
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:33,795
Randolph-San secretly resells weapons flights since years.

460
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:38,585
It ordered to us to do it as a Colonel, us did not can refuse.

461
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,835
You very prepared since the beginning.

462
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:43,575
It is you who placed these weapons on board boat.

463
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:47,015
How will you prove your innocence?

464
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:52,415
You planned all that by resentment towards me.

465
00:27:52,715 --> 00:27:56,075
I had warned you that I will have my revenge.

466
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:04,015
Well, Randolph.

467
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:06,405
One clinks glasses with your health?

468
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:08,545
You should not leave in retirement today?

469
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,245
It is one day important for you, not?

470
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:14,615
You…

471
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:17,875
You this date purposely, isn't this chose?

472
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:22,175
Exactly. At the end of your career of devoted actor,

473
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:26,685
in order to beat you on all the line.

474
00:28:40,945 --> 00:28:45,575
Allow me to be sent in cour martiale as former Major of the Navy.

475
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:48,035
As you would say it yourself:all is ready.

476
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:50,415
You do not like to look at tragedies?

477
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,945
Will you think of me when you will be carried out?

478
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,165
Will you curse me by pushing your last sigh?

479
00:28:56,315 --> 00:28:58,665
Here are which will put an end to my revenge.

480
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,075
I must turn over aboard ship.

481
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:15,045
I must go up on scene.

482
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:21,915
I do not have time to lose with remains.

483
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:25,655
Public, my companions

484
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:29,125
await me!

485
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:33,585
I must go back there now!

486
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:41,275
You…

487
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:45,245
Turn over on board near your companions!

488
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:52,745
I do not want of the assistance of a pirate.

489
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:54,595
I can count only on myself this time.

490
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:55,735
You…

491
00:29:55,975 --> 00:29:57,105
What do you want?

492
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,055
Kid… Leave me.

493
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:02,365
They escape! They escape!

494
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:05,685
Release! Release! Release!

495
00:30:12,135 --> 00:30:13,215
What does it occur?

496
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:14,935
Here it is.

497
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,145
Exact.

498
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:20,075
Why does it always do anything?

499
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:22,855
What does it still make us, there?

500
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,085
It is all him.

501
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:26,965
What does one have to make?

502
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:29,705
It would be said that one does not have the choice.

503
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:31,385
Ah, I will help it.

504
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,375
You are very courageous you!

505
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:36,495
What you ace known as?
Did Randolph flee?

506
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:38,395
What do they make?

507
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:39,465
Catch it! You dispatch!

508
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:40,975
Ah… The enemy is too powerful.

509
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:46,505
The farm! If you let it escape,
I send all to you in cour martiale!

510
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:07,075
You cannot act with more delicacy?

511
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:07,915
Draw! Draw!

512
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:10,455
Run the boat of Randolph and this type consequently occasion!

513
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,155
Use all the guns!

514
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,785
Or it is you who will go in cour martiale!

515
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,255
Take again the representation!

516
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:23,095
Try to go until the end of the part!

517
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,385
We will protect the scene!

518
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:25,575
Fire!

519
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:27,645
Danger!!!

520
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:32,895
Luffy!

521
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:46,685
You believe that this kind of filths is able to kill me?

522
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:51,435
I will become the Lord of the Pirates!

523
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:59,015
I will not let any of these balls touch the ship!

524
00:31:59,155 --> 00:32:01,235
Concentrate on the representation, pépé.

525
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:05,205
Do many people await this last representation, not?

526
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:08,515
Believe me!

527
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:11,795
Once I decided something, I am ready to risk my life!

528
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:13,955
It is that… a pirate!

529
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:19,045
Kid!

530
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,425
You do not brag a little?

531
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:25,725
The spectacle will begin again!

532
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:29,935
All with Randolph-San!

533
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:31,405
Well! One begins again!

534
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:34,565
I all will put in this last representation!

535
00:32:38,635 --> 00:32:39,695
Well!

536
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,795
Run the boats of the pirates and Randolph!

537
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,365
But there are civilians in this boat.

538
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,855
It is Randolph which of it will be responsible.

539
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:14,205
Attack and one will see the remainder afterwards.

540
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:15,195
But…

541
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,635
It is likely to flee. If you do not run the boat of Randolph,

542
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:20,475
you all will be responsible!

543
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,315
All the ships start to attack.

544
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,155
That all the ships start to bombard.

545
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:26,005
Zoro and Sanji-Kun, you of these boats occupy!

546
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:26,455
Well!

547
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:27,385
I occupy myself some.

548
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:28,885
One will let pass no ball!

549
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:29,855
The balls arrive!

550
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,665
Fire!!

551
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:44,895
It is which this type?

552
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:46,585
That rebounded.

553
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:51,885
He, does not let you go.

554
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:54,375
I did not can anything make…

555
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:55,525
Why do you say that?

556
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:59,295
You are not responsible.

557
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:02,295
It is the fault of Baran the pirate.

558
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:05,285
He wants to have all the treasures.

559
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:09,025
All beautiful princesses and islands too.

560
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,245
Begin again yourself. Do not die!!

561
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:20,125
We must use the same weapons as them.

562
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:21,855
Fire!!!

563
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,495
Look at!

564
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:39,255
Qu… What?

565
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,315
Fire! Fire! Fire!

566
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:46,695
With 15° by starboard.

567
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:47,715
Here me is!

568
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,615
Dispatch you to run the ship of Randolph!

569
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:11,885
Let us attack the pirates together.

570
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,885
Which ball this type.

571
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:27,355
Second round!

572
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:28,235
Fire!

573
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,805
We do not have the advantage by defend us.

574
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,235
It is interminable.

575
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,815
It is necessary that they approach so that the advantage is taken again.

576
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:47,095
Robin, do something with these gunners.

577
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:51,305
Even if it is a little far, I will test.

578
00:36:02,335 --> 00:36:03,055
Take that.

579
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:08,025
Super!

580
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:07,885
Well!

581
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:09,105
One approaches them!

582
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,645
Do not be afraid.
Ahead!

583
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,225
The flagship is attacked!

584
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,825
Included/understood. Go in reinforcement.

585
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:20,865
Not. You do not occupy of them.

586
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:26,255
It is the reserve of ammunition.
A cigarette can start an explosion.

587
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:32,625
They is bad to throw cigarettes anywhere.

588
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:34,275
Caution.

589
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:35,735
What did it occur?

590
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,625
It is this type there?

591
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:39,125
At all events,
attack the ship of Randolph.

592
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,945
Call reinforcement!

593
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:41,505
Ok!

594
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,745
It is what the problem?

595
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:44,975
This type cannot…

596
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:46,195
What does he want?

597
00:36:46,715 --> 00:36:50,805
It is the famous hunter of pirates,
Roronoa Zoro d' East Blue.

598
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:52,295
Guessed well.

599
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:57,695
More one gesture!

600
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,605
Ah… Great news!

601
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:15,725
It is my last representation.

602
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:19,425
If I cannot pronounce a word,
all will have been vain.

603
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:29,065
You! Marly, Lieutenant of the Navy!

604
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:32,575
That made 100 years that I await you!
Your time is counted!

605
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:53,135
Wait…
Save to us, please.

606
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:54,945
We do not have anything against you.

607
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:57,095
Stop attacking us.

608
00:37:57,265 --> 00:38:00,285
If we do not listen to the orders of Major Gabana,

609
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:01,745
we will be…

610
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:02,815
Gabana?

611
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:06,005
But which is these types, good blood?

612
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:08,455
It is obvious that it is truth
Luffy with the Straw hat.

613
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,725
Who that?

614
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:12,605
A type which is worth 100 million Berrys.

615
00:38:12,745 --> 00:38:16,095
You… How can you not know
this formidable adversary?

616
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:16,755
I submitted a report/ratio.

617
00:38:17,135 --> 00:38:21,045
It could be that it is the crew of the Luffy pirate to the Straw hat. You inform.

618
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:24,215
Which are the evidence?

619
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,095
I must send to you in cour martiale.

620
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:28,795
Very well.

621
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:31,305
I will tell you the truth now.

622
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:33,565
All that counts for you, it is your promotion.

623
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,635
To stop the pirates does not interest you at all.

624
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:40,655
You do not fulfill your role of Major.

625
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:41,965
Moreover…

626
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:12,305
Now, you will pay for all that.

627
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:13,545
It is finished for you!

628
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:18,795
You have committed all these crimes and transformed
the world in a true hell!

629
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:20,155
It is unforgivable!

630
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:23,545
I will not save to you.

631
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:26,605
I will put my life concerned, leaves to die about it.

632
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:28,845
Until you, dirty pirates…

633
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:36,785
What is there?

634
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,765
You forgot your text?

635
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:43,605
“Until you, dirty pirates, are destroyed!”

636
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,105
It does not arrive any more at speaking?

637
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:51,565
Is it the end? Now?

638
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:55,815
Randolph, that does occur? “Until you, dirty pirates, are destroyed!”

639
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:05,555
I must fight thoroughly against you,
scorning characters!

640
00:40:22,845 --> 00:40:25,465
Yes. Our enemies

641
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:27,165
are not the pirates.

642
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:28,565
We were wrong.

643
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:32,855
Our enemies are these types whose heart dirty and is rotted,

644
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,155
filled up of a disgusting lust.

645
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:47,955
During too a long time, this island was dominated by the Baran pirate who had established his base here.

646
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,515
What you known as?
It is not in the scenario!

647
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:53,795
My friends.
My very dear friends.

648
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:58,105
Even if you lost the hope or those which you like,

649
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:04,595
please, continue to believe that the force
who pushes us with living is more powerful.

650
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,995
Believe there firmly and
create your future in this direction!

651
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:10,095
It is true.

652
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:16,185
How them!!!

653
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:30,585
Return! Return quickly!

654
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:34,075
Return to protect me!

655
00:41:34,265 --> 00:41:35,735
For this type? But which would do it?

656
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:40,925
All the time, we fought for
that this type can appease its ambitions!

657
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:45,125
To become Major of the Navy… It remains to him still much of way to traverse.

658
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:54,155
As long as I am in life,
I will be able to do all that I want.

659
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:56,525
I will not let myself make, it is with me.

660
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:01,365
Yo!

661
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:10,525
I will burst you.

662
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,375
Go, leave with your companions…

663
00:42:25,265 --> 00:42:28,775
It is that the good spirit.

664
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:34,595
Carry out your dreams!
With the pride of the sea,

665
00:42:35,695 --> 00:42:36,935
continue your dreams.

666
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:38,455
We are…

667
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:42,875
Companions.

668
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,545
The last representation of Randolph comes to a end.

669
00:43:10,525 --> 00:43:12,135
It was brilliant!

670
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:24,555
Thank you thousand times, everyone.

671
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:34,345
It is the end one would say, pépé.

672
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:35,755
It is finished.

673
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:38,665
I wanted to see his last representation.

674
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:41,545
I will have had at least to say goodbye or something…

675
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:44,415
Does not cause them any more troubles.

676
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:46,475
And Navy…

677
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,775
To bind friendship with pirates is not easy.

678
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:51,155
The pirates are pirates.

679
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:53,495
It is impossible for them to borrow the same way as normal people.

680
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:57,095
But at least, it will be necessary to remember it the happy heart.

681
00:43:57,515 --> 00:43:58,895
The formidable last representation.

682
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:03,135
He, pépé!!

683
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:06,035
Do not forget that one must finish our baston!!

684
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:07,845
Do not forget!!

685
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:13,905
Similar for you, kid!

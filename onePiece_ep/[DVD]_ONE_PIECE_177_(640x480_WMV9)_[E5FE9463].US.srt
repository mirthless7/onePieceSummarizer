1
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,110
On Upper Yard, ground of God,
the play of Survival beats full sound.

2
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,430
With the service of Eneru God, the Priest Ohm.

3
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,470
The Warrior Shandia, Wiper.

4
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,080
The Knight of the Sky, Gan Fall.

5
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,220
And Zoro.

6
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,030
Each one fights to survive, one
incredible battle is launched!

7
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,610
What a cretin!

8
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,520
Aisa!

9
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,640
You were distracted and you
lowered your guard. Idiots.

10
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,570
Forget the others!

11
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,320
There is nothing any more with
to make to save them.

12
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:48,900
The Ultimate Test of Ordalie of Iron!
The Combat has Mort of the White Barbed wire!!

13
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,630
Played well, Ohm-sama!

14
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,440
In this moment in the ruins
higher, 4 Soldiers are.

15
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,689
And these deux-là does not have
not known as their last mot.

16
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,050
What makes 4 Shandia and
an inhabitant of the Blue Sea.

17
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,340
More the python and Holy.

18
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,580
What makes a total of
10 men and 2 animals.

19
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,960
According to the prediction of God, it
will remain soon that 5 survivors.

20
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,549
Now, let us take again the combat.

21
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,889
I will finish some with you.

22
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,679
Ohm, species of dumb!

23
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,440
To attack Wiper by behind…!

24
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh? This man, who is nothing vis-a-vis
Is God, so important in your eyes?

25
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,779
Wiper is our reason to live!

26
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,420
It showed us
true pride of Shandia!

27
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,970
We are here for
to recover our terre natale!

28
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,280
Poor wretches such as Eneru cannot
not to include/understand the pain of Shandia!

29
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,880
Even if I included/understood, you
would gain any sympathy of my share.

30
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,590
To be frank…

31
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,740
You waste your time!

32
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,410
Burst, Ohm!

33
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,200
You will not échaaapperas me!

34
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,139
We are ready for the final attack.

35
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,870
Holy, it is the moment!

36
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,060
Sink, Holy!

37
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,769
What does it make?

38
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,079
Whore. How a dog
can it run like that?

39
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,480
I do not like that!

40
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,550
Here come the Ultimate one
Test of Ordalie of Iron!

41
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,210
The Combat with Died of the White Barbed wire!!

42
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,579
You did not need
to build this cage.

43
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,790
I will not flee.

44
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,269
Species of imbecile!

45
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,339
Say rather than you
can escape more!

46
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,730
The cage is tiiiissée
white barbed wire!

47
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,000
And then?

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,860
Then…

49
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,420
Ca makes very badly when one rubs there.

50
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,060
How I leave from here once
I will have cut out you out of discs?

51
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,550
Worry about that once
that you will have cut out us.

52
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,590
There remain 8 men and 2 animals.

53
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,360
I must initially deal with this python.

54
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,379
Nami is inside…

55
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,090
And…

56
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,660
Knight of the Sky!!

57
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,340
this man who saved Chopper, too.

58
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,980
Wiper!

59
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,010
When we were children,
you taught me a thing.

60
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,360
Our Shandia ancestors
lived in the Blue Sea,

61
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,410
in the large capital
holy of Shandora.

62
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,340
The Large Karugara Warrior
our ground protected.

63
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,730
But, 400 years ago…

64
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,600
Knock-up Stream propelled
Shandora, thus creating the celestial island.

65
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,109
It will never be able
to turn over in the Blue Sea.

66
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,240
What was to be to them unbearable.

67
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,179
However…

68
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,789
However, inhabitants
celestial island…

69
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,290
regarded as their ground
crowned and concealed it to us!

70
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,579
Our ancestors were driven out
of their terre natale.

71
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,929
They could never turn over
in the holy capital.

72
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,310
They did not can even touch
ground of their village!

73
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,339
And during these 400 years,

74
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,990
Shandia underwent humiliation!

75
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,300
Upper Yard is with us!

76
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,780
We will recover it!

77
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,340
It is our terre natale!

78
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,120
Pride of our ancestors!

79
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,869
Once us in
will have finished with Eneru,

80
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,170
it will not be any more the sorrow of
to make concern for a bag of Vearth.

81
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,810
We will turn over to Shandia,
our home, 400 years before!

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,439
That those which are not yet ready
to risk their lives remain here.

83
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,009
I would not be upset with them.

84
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,199
He, Wiper.

85
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,480
Loans? We always were it.

86
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,660
Summers you ready to give up those which
will fall on the battle field?

87
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,869
That those which will span theirs
brothers fallen to the combat…

88
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,930
and which will continue, follow me.

89
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,129
Today, I…

90
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,120
will take the head of Eneru!

91
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,320
Wiper!

92
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,340
WIPER!

93
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,790
God thank you, I find you!

94
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,679
Laki?!

95
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,019
Wiper!

96
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,740
Listen to me!

97
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,370
What?! What you insane there?!

98
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,510
I came to repeat you
what Kamakiri said!

99
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,580
Nobody can beat it…

100
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,179
Escaped, Wiper!

101
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,130
Cease the combat!

102
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,940
Eneru is… in the forest.

103
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,829
He, Laki!

104
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,780
Eneru is what people fear more than
all since mists of time, the incarnate lightning.

105
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,640
Remain with the variation!

106
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,570
MOVE AWAY FROM HERE!

107
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,319
You cannot overcome it!

108
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,420
HE, STOPS!

109
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,920
Wiper?

110
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,120
You called me?

111
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,540
Eneru…

112
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,439
Does not approach you it, Eneru!

113
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,960
Does not touch it!

114
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,180
It gave up the combat!

115
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,860
HE!

116
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,690
LAKI!

117
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,710
Laki! Does not attack it!!

118
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,860
LAKI!

119
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,400
ESCAPE!

120
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,849
Bandage idiooots!

121
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,090
You will not survive if
you worry about the others!

122
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,440
It is invincible!

123
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,530
It is what people fear more than
all since mists of time, the lightning.

124
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,730
Reincarnation of God!

125
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,960
I hold you, Wiper!

126
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,620
Species of idiot!

127
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,050
Flee!

128
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,530
Eneru…!

129
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,869
Hein?

130
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,559
Did Ca do anything to him?

131
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,030
Then I will give him another of them!

132
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,039
You are even more
ignoramus that I thought it,

133
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,290
Wiper, the Shandia Warrior.

134
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,739
Whether it is a woman or a warrior,

135
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,540
I do not make distinctions enters
the sheep which are opposed to me.

136
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,640
With a little chance, she will survive.

137
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,069
This was… God?

138
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,870
CYB3RFR34K-ISO

139
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,370
SKYPIEA-FANSUB

140
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,999
And well. This woman was insane.

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,240
Even petrified fear,
it attacked God.

142
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,130
It was its punishment.

143
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,200
I have a last thing with
to make before breaking me from here.

144
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,160
PYTHON!

145
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,640
You ace a trick in
the stomach which I need!

146
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,200
Release from my way!

147
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,190
Holy! Stir up yourself!

148
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,909
Eisen

149
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,810
[Note:eisen = iron (in
German) & whip = whip]

150
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,240
CENTER!

151
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,120
Now, there are 6
men and 2 animals.

152
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,559
Super.

153
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,540
Nobody with the wounded air.

154
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,059
Which is this place?

155
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,929
We are in the stomach of the snake.

156
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,449
One was made swallow.

157
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,339
Ah, I see.

158
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,140
This stomach with the rather long air.

159
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,780
Are He, Aisa, you well?

160
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,430
Wiper, I am sorry!

161
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,700
Hein?

162
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,949
Which is this place?

163
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,189
Interior of the stomach of the snake.

164
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,839
You had not noticed?

165
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,279
Do not be quite malignant for you.

166
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,479
The snake?!

167
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,019
Good, let us leave quickly from here
before being digested.

168
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,319
I hope that Waver is in good state.

169
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,810
But, why are not you
not on the boat?

170
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,519
This thing continued us
then we had to flee.

171
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,180
My faith, that does not disturb me.
Is this young girl Shandia?

172
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,960
Oh not! God!

173
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,399
I will eliminate you!

174
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,830
He! Now, stops with that.

175
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,520
Besides, you believe that we would have
to bore the wall of its stomach?

176
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,329
DO NOT BE STUPID!

177
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,609
What it would arrive to us
if it were put at régurgiter?!

178
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,209
You want to die?!

179
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,099
Reflect a little!

180
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,900
O-Oh… I joked just.

181
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,659
It is what your problem?

182
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,110
Odd knight, you
be really odd!

183
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,959
Whore.

184
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,009
I am curious to see
the head of somebody…

185
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,750
of enough stupid to attack
this thing of the interior.

186
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,670
This noise…

187
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,100
Noises of step.

188
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,870
But which that can be well?

189
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,550
Who goes there?

190
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,029
Nami!

191
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,739
Odd Papi!

192
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,160
You…

193
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,830
Luffy!

194
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,289
What you made…

195
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,660
in this mysterious cave?

196
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,340
Wait, until you make here?

197
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,630
I lost myself!

198
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,509
I do not manage to believe in it.

199
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,259
The snake also swallowed Luffy.

200
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,550
I hope that the others are well.

201
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,479
Hein? I arrived there all alone.

202
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,010
Hein?! The snake?!

203
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,159
Exact.

204
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,759
It is for that you are there.

205
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,839
Oh, I see.

206
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,709
Ca was to be terrifying.

207
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,970
You were done
to eat by the snake?

208
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,049
As… I… said…

209
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,859
YOU TOO!

210
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,710
ONE IS ALL IN the STOMACH OF the SNAKE!

211
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,180
Do not draw me the nose! My nose!

212
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,270
The head of Usopp!

213
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,860
Who is this cretin?

214
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,160
I have shame to acknowledge it, but
it is the captain of our boat.

215
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,069
Oh, then you are the captain.

216
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,269
I believe that it is the end of the world.

217
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,049
Ouais, it is the impression which it gives.

218
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,510
Do not be very malignant for you if you ace not
noticed that you had been made swallow.

219
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,199
Then, it is the stomach of the python?!

220
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,269
I was made eat, me too?!

221
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,199
It is what I tests
to render comprehensible you.

222
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,940
Your clothes are also in
train being made digest.

223
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,099
He, you are right!

224
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,790
He, it is necessary to find
the bottom of this thing!

225
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,759
Its bottom…

226
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,240
It is like that you intend to leave?!

227
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,170
One was made eat, then one does not have
that to leave at the same time as the excrement.

228
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,199
NOT!

229
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,440
Rather to make me digest!

230
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,719
Nami makes fear.

231
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,920
Women of the Blue Sea
are really violent.

232
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,180
At all events, it
snake is of bad mood,

233
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,309
Then one was made eat.

234
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,999
Before it recovers
in anger, we must…

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,059
It is of bad mood?

236
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,469
Ouais.

237
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,840
It had the very sick air
and pain twisted.

238
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,760
Why it was sick?

239
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,880
OH NOT!

240
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,329
You… made grabuge
since you are in it?

241
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,480
Ouais, I tested
to break the wall to leave!

242
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,510
Then it was you.

243
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,189
And all these efforts gave me hunger.

244
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,470
You have anything to eat?

245
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,660
What is there?

246
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,119
You…

247
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,240
CRETIN!!

248
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,859
You shout like an imbecile.

249
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,630
Make as you want!

250
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Be not made digest
before I arrive, Aisa!

251
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,940
Now, I go
to open by tearing it!

252
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,290
Dumb!

253
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,269
Hold good still a little, Nami…

254
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,790
And… heu… Odd knight!

255
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,290
Just time to put
a beating with this guy.

256
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,580
Now, it is time to finish some.

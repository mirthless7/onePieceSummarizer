1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,170
You do not make the weight.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,539
Hurry to give us that.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,380
You will stain it blood.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,520
Shit. I believed capacity to gain.

5
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,889
In fact…

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,069
Iceberg-san had said to me to flee as soon as possible.

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,870
To throw this trick and to run.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,390
Because…

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,559
It is a forgery!

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,360
What?

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,529
I am wedged!

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,780
Shit, I am still wedged!

13
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,509
Straw hat.

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,230
RANKYAKU
[Rankyaku = storm of legs]

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,340
It split the wall with a kick!

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,280
It is what?

17
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,309
We have an urgency, we do not have time to chatter with you.

18
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,209
I cannot move!

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,570
Oi, attaches the other too.

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,720
You break!

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,859
I do not have anything to give you!

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,140
It is damage.

23
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,430
By where to start?

24
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,580
You disappoint me…

25
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,790
You, who soon will die.

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,879
Lucci!

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,679
It is you the faulty one.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,409
It is thus because you do not have gave it to the government whereas they asked it gentillement to you.

29
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,789
Kaku!

30
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:19,279
We wanted you to leave, you and this city, without making stories.

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,559
Kalifa…

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,599
I see that you inherited the obstinacy of your Master.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,769
Blueno, the barman.

34
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,739
You all were…

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,229
Members of the government.

36
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,259
Yes.

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,170
We to dissimulate among the others was not difficult.

38
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:44,249
But I was astonished by your wisdom.

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,909
Then, Iceberg-san…

40
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,669
The hiding-place of the sketches of Pluto, the Ancestral Weapon…

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,570
Say to us, before there are other victims.

42
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,760
The bond hidden!
Iceberg and Franky

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,449
I must make quickly.

44
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,860
The waves and the wind are increasingly strong.

45
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,040
What it fout?!

46
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,790
Return it to me.

47
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,979
It is the money…

48
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,960
Who will be useful to us…

49
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,169
To repair our boat.

50
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,410
With this money…

51
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,149
We will be able to finally look after the wounds of Merry!

52
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,110
I will not let to you take it!

53
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,219
What they said, the 200 million was designed to repair the boat.

54
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,590
It is not with the current for Aqua Laguna, this evening.

55
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,130
It is annoying.

56
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,829
Yosh, with all that…

57
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,919
Ca devarit to be good, if I find some boards moreover.

58
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,930
Not need.

59
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,049
Be to you which?

60
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,299
Who? Don't Oi, oi, you remember already more ego?

61
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,919
Kid with the long nose.

62
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,239
It is the same voice as the other time!

63
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,309
What you insane here?!

64
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,129
Let us go, go! Do not irritate you.

65
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,520
It would be damage to start a combat here.

66
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,909
This place will be submerged soon by the high tide.

67
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,889
We will have to take your boat to you cherished…

68
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,479
As an hostage.

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,279
About what you do speak?

70
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,749
Nothing important, just a small dilemma with Straw hat…

71
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,980
Then I came to kidnap you.

72
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,959
You do not worry, I made use of the back of my blades.

73
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,569
Why you all massacred them?!

74
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,749
It is strong, Zoro.

75
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,719
At all events, we dispatch!

76
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,219
Zoro, by there!

77
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,759
I said by there!

78
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,559
How can it be mistaken whereas I passed in front?!

79
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,639
It is a miracle!

80
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,619
By there?

81
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,659
What? Did Zoro leave?

82
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,149
A miracle!

83
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,760
It was still lost?!

84
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,619
Look at, I unwedged my head.

85
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,769
Because I am elastic.

86
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,979
Yosh, brilliant. Now, releases itself like that!

87
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,280
Yosh, it left.

88
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,580
I am free, because I am elastic.

89
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,309
You are gifted. Good, I detaches.

90
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,890
Yosh, of agreement.

91
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,340
You will pay it to me, the cow and the skeleton!

92
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,449
We have been infiltrated for five years.

93
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,969
Do not worry you.

94
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,610
We always did our work correctly.

95
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,009
You have the désenparé air, but…

96
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,849
We wasted time like that already enough.

97
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,739
We will make all our possible…

98
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,849
To achieve our goal.

99
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,670
You would make better not resist

100
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,749
You must surely know the name of Cipher pol.

101
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,689
Commonly allotted CP1 to CP8.

102
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,269
The government placed its secret services in eight places of the world.

103
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,969
Under the orders of the government, they can locate all types of information, anywhere.

104
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,959
I was with the current.

105
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,209
But only until the CP8.

106
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,999
I suspected it.

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,979
But we are the CP9.

108
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,539
Ninth Cipher pol. which should not be.

109
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,739
From our special rights, we cannot be discovered. ***

110
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,490
Rights?

111
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,949
Yes.

112
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,839
We always act in the name of justice.

113
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,630
But for those which do not want to cooperate with the government, we have…

114
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,040
Right to kill.

115
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,889
Ca does not have any direction! The right to kill is not justified!

116
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,219
The government considered the question…

117
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,459
Rather than to fear the résurection of the Weapon…

118
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,519
They will make it return…

119
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,249
In order to put a term at this wave of piracy thanks to the power of justice.

120
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,979
But you did not cooperate until now.

121
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,249
You say not to want to help people…

122
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,239
Who suffer under plunderings from pirates.

123
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,569
It is out of the question. If the Weapon is résuscitée, everyone will tear off it.

124
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,799
Ca will do nothing but worsen the things!

125
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,249
You seem not to make confidence with the government.

126
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,070
Iceberg-san.

127
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,660
I know the human nature, kid.

128
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,910
Supervise your words! You are not any more our boss!

129
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,440
Kaku, take its pulse.

130
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,360
Forgiveness.

131
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:13,499
Iceberg-san. We raised assumptions presently.

132
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,989
Calm remainder.

133
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,370
We will not tortuerons ourselves.

134
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,300
All that you have to make is to listen to these assumptions.

135
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,480
Your blood will reveal us the truth.

136
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,460
Pay attention while playing. You could hurt you.

137
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,200
Grandmother, grandmother! One soon will return?

138
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,739
Yes, soon. The wind is strong, a small turning and one returns.

139
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,970
Just what to rack a little.

140
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,910
And you continuous of drinking?

141
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,600
Can He, He, you rack while drinking at the same time?

142
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,120
Of course. I decades since, isn't this drinks?

143
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,230
Decades? It is odd!

144
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:48,420
Bi-zard! Bi-zard! Bi-zard! Bi-zard!

145
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,209
Ah, not of the decades.

146
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,180
Ca makes eight years.

147
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,769
Then lets to us inform you of our assumptions.

148
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:17,509
First of all, the fact that you us board delivered a false plan.

149
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:24,800
You had guessed that the government sought it and thought to have found its hiding-place.

150
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,179
But…

151
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,059
Ca was not the case.

152
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,809
And if someone else had killed you to obtain them…

153
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,849
Then there would have been nobody to transmit truths sketch.

154
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,159
You are not enough stupid to have omitted this detail.

155
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,629
As you knew that…

156
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,279
You transmitted the sketches to nobody this evening.

157
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,930
What wants to say that you have already to entrust them to someone else.

158
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,839
In any case, they are not any more in your possession.

159
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,400
It is what we have deduce.

160
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,759
Ca is not used for nothing to resist.

161
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,209
But Ca remains an assumption.

162
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,349
Of course, we do not have any proof.

163
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,949
During the five years of investigation…

164
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,739
We did not can anything guess your acts.

165
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,279
Moreover, those to which are entrusted the sketches…

166
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,530
Must have necessary competence.

167
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,169
But let us continue with the assumptions. Ca becomes interesting now.

168
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,230
On the false sketch which we found…

169
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,899
While looking at attentively, one sees signatures.

170
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:52,519
“Tom”, “Iceberg”, and “Cutty Flam”. And at the end, the name of the companie, “Tom' S Workers”.

171
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,789
You believed to take to speed the enemy with this false sketch.

172
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,329
But you did not think that the enemy was so close to you.

173
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,369
Bad calculation.

174
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:12,040
For these intruders who sought the sketches yesterday and today, it was only one vulgar bit of paper.

175
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,529
But…

176
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:20,480
For we who have lived in this city for five years, the names on these sketches are very interesting.

177
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,490
Iceberg-san, we have visit.

178
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,269
The legendary company, “Tom' S Workers”, under the direction of Tom…

179
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,369
Hide many mysteries.

180
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,739
Although it existed on this island…

181
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,929
No administrative paper confirms it.

182
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,920
We needed much time to discover that you were a disciple of Tom.

183
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,179
According to a report/ratio of the government, Tom had only two disciples.

184
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:55,069
And the government has us to affirm that one of them had died in an accident.

185
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,129
You hear that?

186
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:03,310
Cutty Flam, the violent apprentice of Tom died.

187
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,830
But I already heard this name some share, “Cutty Flam”.

188
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,899
Iceberg-san, we have visit.

189
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,559
He said that you would include/understand if I said, “Cutty Flam”.

190
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,059
It arrived little from time after our infiltration, about four years.

191
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,349
It passed the door of Galley it Company and asked to see you.

192
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,689
He pronounced only this name.

193
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,399
I remember it very well.

194
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,330
Me too.

195
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,329
Do I have to let it enter?

196
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,710
Not, make leave it.

197
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,279
What wants to say…

198
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,479
Cutty Flam, the second apprentice of Tom, is always in life…

199
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,330
Who more is, in this city…

200
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,630
UNDER THE NAME OF “FRANKY”!

201
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,320
Here funny in way of accommodating me.

202
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,119
Ca… It is what? They is the sketches of the Ancestral Weapon?

203
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,570
From now, débarassse of the name of “Cutty Flam”.

204
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,569
It is nothing any more but one matter of time before I would be located.

205
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,809
Take that with you and leaves this island, Franky.

206
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,950
No doubt on top.

207
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,370
I would never have thought that there was a bond between you and him.

208
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,749
It is true that Franky is a man on whom we did very little research.

209
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,409
One to disassemble boat, it is all that we know of him.

210
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,239
I include/understand. To make imply a death in our research…

211
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,329
To scramble the tracks, the idea was good.

212
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,319
Franky Family came to sell its boards with the building site.

213
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,099
And by clearing up you well, you could then transmit the sketches constantly.

214
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,849
When I reconsider there…

215
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,039
All that occurred under our nose, without one realizing there. **

216
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,359
If the sketches are not in your possession…

217
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,339
I include/understand your heroic attitude better.

218
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,439
If the person to which you had entrusted it were your former companion…

219
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,359
I include/understand why you gave it to no engineer of Galley it.

220
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,179
Now, very lights.

221
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,889
Moreover…

222
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,780
Your pulse confirms that we saw just!

223
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,149
Quickly!

224
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,590
Oi!

225
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,039
You are sure that it is by there?

226
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,940
It is you who asks that?!

227
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,040
They are touched hard.

228
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,279
Over there! It is this door opposite!

229
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,850
There are many people with ground.

230
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,539
Go, passes first! Cut out the door and sinks!

231
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,439
Go ahead!

232
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,119
THAT IS ENOUGH! DO NOT GIVE ME ORDERS!

233
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,720
Oi, Straw hat!

234
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,290
Imbecile, not here! It is the part of at side!

235
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,149
What, at side?

236
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,489
Not…

237
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,919
It is not your fault.

238
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,489
So much of events accumulated this night, that it is normal…

239
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,599
That you donot can hide your distress, whereas you are covered with blood.

240
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,909
Thank you to have taken care on us until now.

241
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,109
You are not any more any utility.

242
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,190
Dispatch we to find Franky.

243
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,890
Be made foutre.

244
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,549
WHERE IS ROBIN?!

245
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,359
Luffy!

246
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,000
Luffy?!

247
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,810
Of the intruders.

248
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,640
Robin, I find you finally!

249
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,809
Oi, Luffy! Where had you passed?

250
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,099
Robin, they is good to re-examine you!

251
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,250
He, wait. What does it occur?

252
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,690
Let us go, go…

253
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,870
Straw hat! Paulee!

254
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,529
Iceberg-san.

255
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,360
That…

256
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,910
WHAT It IS THAT THIS BROTHEL?!

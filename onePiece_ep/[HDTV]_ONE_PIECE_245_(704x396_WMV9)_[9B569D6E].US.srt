1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:05,750
On the false sketch which we found…

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,850
While looking at attentively, one sees signatures.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,250
“Tom”, “Iceberg”, “Cutty Flam”. And at the end, the name of the companie, “Tom' S Workers”.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,550
But I already heard this name some share, “Cutty Flam”.

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,150
Cutty Flam, the second apprentice of Tom, is always in life…

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,850
Who more is, in this city…

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,450
UNDER THE NAME OF “FRANKY”!

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,850
Go, passes first! Cut out the door and sinks!

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,649
Go ahead!

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,310
THAT IS ENOUGH! DO NOT GIVE ME ORDERS!

11
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,050
WHERE IS ROBIN?!

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,749
Luffy!

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,750
Luffy?!

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,050
Robin, I find you finally!

15
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,349
Oi, Luffy! Where had you passed?

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,650
Robin, they is good to re-examine you!

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,950
Wait! What does it occur?

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,350
Let us go, go…

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,650
Iceberg-san.

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,020
What…

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,150
WHAT It IS THAT THIS BROTHEL?!

22
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,450
Paulee! Why didn't you flee?

23
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,750
It is what all that?!

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,650
Then… It is them… which wanted to kill you.

25
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,050
WHY ARE YOU EQUIPPED LIKE THAT?!

26
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,050
Oi!

27
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,250
Kalifa, Blueno, Kaku, Lucci, stop your conneries!

28
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:37,250
Return, Robin!
Confrontation with the CP9!

29
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,290
It is true!

30
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,250
They are the carpenters who accompanied you, not truth?

31
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,449
Now that you say it, I recognize the Nose-Square.

32
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,250
Then the assassins were infiltrated!

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,650
Does Ca want to say what?

34
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,850
Paulee, actually, we are spies of the government.

35
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,050
Then, we if we excuse ourselves, isn't this will be forgiven?

36
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,850
After all, we are companions, building boats at your sides.

37
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,950
If you do not manage to believe in it, do you want that I strike Iceberg with the face?

38
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,000
Stop your conneries. You made some enough like that.

39
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,150
The voice of the mask of buffalo resembles much holds.

40
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,950
Species of jerk…

41
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,550
YOU CAN EXPRESS YOURSELF NORMALLY!

42
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,650
Insane steps of me!

43
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,250
Stop, Paulee!

44
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,950
[finger killer]

45
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,750
Doesn't Ca have is enough to you, presently, Paulee?

46
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,520
Oi, encordé!

47
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,350
Why…

48
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,450
You…

49
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,550
No imprudence.

50
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,550
Our techniques exceed the human understanding.

51
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,350
After a long drive, our body became the equivalent of a weapon, the “Rokushiki”.

52
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:59,350
[Rokushiki = six styles]

53
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,750
That which it control has a superhuman force.

54
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,449
Stop with the casinos.

55
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,650
Imbecile, I had chance today, then it is my round!

56
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,850
Blueno, of beer, more beer!

57
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,150
No problems.

58
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,150
Whore, Kalifa, still equipped like that!

59
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,650
Stop, Paulee. You have only with step to look at it, not?

60
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,150
Why you…?

61
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,750
It is not serious.

62
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,450
We were to kill you in any event.

63
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,950
It is sad, my friend.

64
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,949
Lucci, stops!

65
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,650
You, that stops!

66
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,350
GOMU GOMU NO…

67
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,850
TENKAI!

68
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,750
GAtTLING GUN

69
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,550
What? Ca did anything to him!

70
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,249
Fact of shitting.

71
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,050
SORU!

72
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,650
It disappeared.

73
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,050
SHIGAN!

74
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,850
Luffy!

75
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,850
A normal man would have died with this blow…

76
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,320
Rubber servant boy.

77
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,150
What do you make, Straw hat?

78
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,150
You tried to kill it, not truth?!

79
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,150
Isn't he your companion carpenter?

80
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,450
Previously, yes… But now.

81
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,450
Be to you really a treaty!

82
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,050
But that done anything.

83
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,280
In any event, I promised to him…

84
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,850
That one would burst those which tried to kill Ice-ossan!

85
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,750
Why combine to you with Paulee?

86
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,150
Because me also, I have hope to regulate with you.

87
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,450
Oi, Robin! What you insane with these people?!

88
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,549
If you want from to go away, gives us a good reason!

89
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,350
Yes, they said that they were government!
Then, why?

90
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,449
You are really obstinate.

91
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,750
I bade my farewell with Cook-san and Doctor-san.

92
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,870
They did not say to you?

93
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,650
Of course that if! But I cannot accept that! Why, Robin?

94
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,150
To achieve my goal.

95
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,350
A dream which will never become reality if I remain near you.

96
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,050
To achieve this goal, I would sacrifice anything!

97
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,350
Then it is for that you made show your own companions.

98
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,150
Which is this goal?

99
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,550
You do not need to know it.

100
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,040
You will not be able to reason it.

101
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,450
This woman is…

102
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,750
Sure Es you of what you advance, Nico Robin?
Do you go counts of what you do?

103
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,450
Nobody authorized you to speak!

104
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,050
Quiet remainder!

105
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,350
Iceberg-san!

106
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,950
I will not let anybody bar the road!

107
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,450
I will not let anybody bar the road!

108
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,150
Oi, Robin! What you insane?!

109
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,950
Be serious for you?

110
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,260
Robin, what it arrives to you?!

111
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,190
Es you really our enemies, Robin?

112
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,750
Please excuse me, but one stops there.

113
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,050
Now, we must find somebody.

114
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,849
We do not have time.

115
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,150
We have anything any more to make, neither here, nor with you.

116
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,050
Kalifa, how long still?

117
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,250
Two minutes.

118
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,149
You were not warned…

119
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,450
But in two minutes, this fortress will be absorbed by the flames.

120
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,450
What?

121
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,150
To erase all unspecified traces, fire is very effective.

122
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,350
If you do not want to die flarings…

123
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,550
You would make better leave quickly.

124
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,850
But if, of course…

125
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,150
You of it are able.

126
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,049
They want to finish some with us.

127
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,650
Nico Robin is on their side.

128
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,750
Luffy, do you accept the departure of Robin?

129
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,350
OF COURSE THAT NOT!

130
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,350
Do not howl.

131
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,350
Soon, the flames will be spread in several rooms.

132
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,350
But the culprits are the pirates.

133
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,150
Here what it occurred.

134
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,850
Dumb!

135
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,950
You act like cowards while making wear the hat to the others.

136
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,950
Our reputation is tarnished already well enough like that.

137
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,350
Good…

138
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,050
I leave first.

139
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,750
Ah, make as you want, you finished your mission.

140
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,650
Wait, Robin!

141
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,450
I am not agreement!

142
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,150
Good-bye.

143
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,950
Robin!

144
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,050
Do not let it leave! Nico Robin!

145
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,250
Where you go, now that you were found?!

146
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,549
Release from my way!

147
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,550
TENKAI!

148
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,850
Why their body is so hard?

149
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,150
Our over-trained body…

150
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,450
Can harden a such iron carapace.

151
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,750
But to box the blows is not our only strong point.

152
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,850
I YOU AI KNOWN AS TO RELEASE!

153
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,850
KAMIE!
[Kamie = sheet of paper]

154
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,450
In spite of its size, Luffy does not manage to reach it!

155
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,050
It is as nimble as a sheet of paper!

156
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,050
Robin!

157
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,350
Wait!

158
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,310
You…

159
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,750
GOMU GOMU NO…

160
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,750
GUN!

161
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,250
It still disappeared!

162
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,250
Our legs is so fast, it is as if one disappeared.

163
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,750
GENPO!

164
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,950
We can strike the air to float.

165
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,750
It flies! How?!

166
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,649
Moreover…

167
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,650
RANKEN!

168
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,550
A sharp blow?!

169
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,549
You, drop you!

170
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,550
Why?!

171
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,750
Luffy!

172
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,150
They have just split the wall with a kick?

173
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,550
Thanks to our speed, we can create Kamakaze.

174
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,549
[Kamakaze = wind slicing]

175
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,150
It is Rankyaku.

176
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,950
One crossed on the boat, Roronoa.

177
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,950
Then you were not engineer.

178
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,750
Thus boat diagnoses it was false?

179
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,950
Unfortunately, I carried out this diagnostic correctly.

180
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,450
It is well damage!

181
00:17:59,050 --> 00:17:59,850
Luffy.

182
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,350
Remain there, Robin!

183
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,650
The discution is not finished!

184
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,349
If, it is it. We will not be re-examined any more.

185
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,550
Robin!

186
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,410
Luffy, hurries to catch up with Robin!

187
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,750
Are Roronoa, you sure that you look at the good place?

188
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,450
Zoro!

189
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,450
SHIGAN!

190
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,820
We do not need balls to transpierce the human body.

191
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,150
You… Dumb… Release me.

192
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,650
He stopped Luffy so easily.

193
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,250
Go ahead, Nico Robin.

194
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,250
Robin!

195
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,550
Shit.

196
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,250
Luffy!

197
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,250
Zoro.

198
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,190
From where does this force come to them?

199
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,750
Who be you?!

200
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,070
We come all from various places.

201
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:33,250
Us, the CP9, which were selected to be used the government for the danger of our lives…

202
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,750
We involve ourselves in order to exceed the limits of the human body.

203
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:47,380
And thus, we acquired the six super-capacities:Rokushiki.

204
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,149
You could return account to you yourself…

205
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,450
Difference in power between you, simple pirates…

206
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,950
And us, to whom was entrusted most important of the missions.

207
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,050
This mission is a business of state.

208
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,550
We will not let to you interfere.

209
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,870
Lucci.

210
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,250
It is time of déclancher the fire. We must hurry.

211
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,150
As long as one is there…

212
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,750
I would like to show you something.

213
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,450
It is…

214
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,450
Lucci, which are you?!

215
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,250
Enormous!

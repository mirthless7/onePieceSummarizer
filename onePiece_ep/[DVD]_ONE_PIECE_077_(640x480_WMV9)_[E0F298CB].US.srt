1
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,130
Good-bye the island of the giants!

2
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,130
Let us leave for Arabasta!

3
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,480
It was hot in it.

4
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,240
It is all that you could do?

5
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,440
Now, can you say where I am?

6
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,290
How you have…

7
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,370
known where I was?

8
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,420
Instinct!

9
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,360
He!

10
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,790
Look at that! Over there!

11
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,850
There is a rainbow! A rainbow!

12
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,770
It is sincere even when it cries!

13
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,610
It is like being under a gross chute d'eau.

14
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,610
I include/understand… Brogy Master…

15
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,170
Dorry…

16
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,790
You… Why?

17
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,180
I believe that I disappeared.

18
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,760
Mr. 0?

19
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,890
If I remember well, wasn't this the name of the Boss of the enemies about which Vivi-Chan spoke to us?

20
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,850
Therefore, the man with the other end of this Den Den Mushi is…

21
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,850
Den Den Mushi:Snail Phon

22
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,650
One of Shichibukai!

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,870
Ca makes a few days that I did not give you your orders.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
What does it occur?

25
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,300
Mr. 3…

26
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,790
Ca must be the owner of this Den Den Mushi.

27
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
I see, I include/understand the situation.

28
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,150
It is the den of the enemy.

29
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,240
And this guy named Mr. 3 continues Vivi-Chan to kill it.

30
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,660
Whore…

31
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,790
I do really not should have gone to drive out outside!

32
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,080
They may find it beneficial to be left there.

33
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,970
What is it that this silence?

34
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,620
I asked you a question?

35
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,480
Did you eliminate princess Vivi and the pirates from Straw hat?

36
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes, mission accomplished.

37
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,920
I got rid of these bastard which knew your secrecy.

38
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,500
Therefore, more need to continue them now.

39
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,710
I see. Good work.

40
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,560
Unluckies move towards your position.

41
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,410
They will confirm the success of your mission and will carry out a delivery.

42
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,180
Unluckies?

43
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,550
A delivery?

44
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,230
A eternal poses for the kingdom of Arabasta.

45
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,820
You and Misses Week Golden delicious must turn over to Arabasta.

46
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,600
It is the moment.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,850
We will begin the most critical part of our plan.

48
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,540
More detailed instructions will await you Arabasta.

49
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,950
It is which these deux-là?

50
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,290
He! What does it occur?

51
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,530
Oh… nothing, really…

52
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,630
Brothel!

53
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
You try to kill me, hein?

54
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Try to see, otter of shit!

55
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,260
And you you would have just

56
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,360
to stop that immediately!

57
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,750
Giant chicken of shit!

58
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,620
What did it occur?

59
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,010
It was what this noise?

60
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,410
It was nothing…

61
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,820
One of these bastard of Straw hat was still in life.

62
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,790
But that goes, I completed it.

63
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,940
You rest reassured.

64
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,900
Living?

65
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,680
You said to me that you had finished your mission.

66
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,790
It is not what you said?

67
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,220
Yes, but…

68
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,510
I thought of having done it, yes.

69
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,280
But this bastard was more coriace that envisaged.

70
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,680
In other words, you gave me a false report/ratio.

71
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,730
Euh… eh well…

72
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,030
If you want to say that like that…

73
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,980
But this time, I am sure to have finished some with him.

74
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,050
You do not need more to send someone else, Ok?

75
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,040
In short.

76
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,970
At all events, you direct towards Arabasta.

77
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,570
It was surely… because of your weapon.

78
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,500
Its weapon?

79
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,360
Of course!

80
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,520
After 100 years of use in their duel,

81
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,560
even the weapons of Elbaf are not able any more to cross as much.

82
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,070
It is a chance…

83
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,430
An incredible miracle!

84
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,600
He, Brogy.

85
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,420
You hurt me.

86
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,460
I am so content that you would be alive, my dear friend!

87
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,300
There is no miracle.

88
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,610
It is normal.

89
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,750
It is stranger than these weapons are still intact after 100 years of combat.

90
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,590
And it is similar for them.

91
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,500
Today is one day splendid!

92
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,140
I thank our Elbaf God!

93
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,210
Oh Brogy.

94
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,050
You seem happy to have had the chance to cut out me and to estourbir me.

95
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,480
Cretin! Do not say that!

96
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,610
Do not strike me my wound!

97
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,410
You seek the brawl, dumb?

98
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,240
Yes!

99
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I will pulverize you!

100
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,700
Ouahou!

101
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,090
Too much extremely!

102
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,970
Incredible!

103
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
Why do you still fight?

104
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,550
I put an end to the transmission.

105
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,280
It would be a shame which the Navy has wind of that.

106
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,190
I will recontact you way in which you received your orders until now.

107
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,720
It is all.
Made quickly, Mr. 3!

108
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,300
Miss All Sunday!

109
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,200
What is there?

110
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,640
Send Mr. 2 to Little Garden.

111
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,850
Make lay out it of Mr. 3 on the road between Arabasta and Little Garden.

112
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,480
It is rather hard of your share, not?
Mr. 0 Crocodile…

113
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,200
We have enough personnel.

114
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,290
You oppose so that I say?

115
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,290
Not.

116
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,550
I am the orders.

117
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,380
Ca will be arranged immediately.

118
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,230
The line is cut.

119
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,130
Good,

120
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,080
it is which these guys?

121
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:27,920
It is what?

122
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,990
Then it is that the premium on our heads?

123
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,480
I had completely forgotten.

124
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,340
But the reason first of their arrival on the island, it was me…

125
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,580
IEA!

126
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,440
You will close it?

127
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,020
It rightly, Vivi!

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,710
Why do you worry?

129
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,820
You want a senbei?

130
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,820
Senbei = rice Cookie

131
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,930
Where did you find that?

132
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,140
Yosh! It is the moment to make Senbei party!

133
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,340
But that will not be a party if there are only senbei.

134
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,840
Really? One can clink glasses with nevertheless, not?

135
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,060
Does somebody want you?

136
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,160
Kanpai!

137
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,880
He, you waste them.

138
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,100
Whore, not to respect food like that…

139
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,710
Do ball, what you make?

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
Who said that I will not eat them?

141
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,290
He! You can always eat them!

142
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,120
But you balanced them!

143
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,430
What is there?

144
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,310
Nothing, just an insect bite.

145
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,700
Eh well, to wait one year so that the log is regulated on the next island, they is rather serious…

146
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,730
You are right!

147
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,280
There is no what to laugh!

148
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,980
We have a debt towards you.

149
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,970
It must be possible to express you our gratitude.

150
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,060
Ok giants-Ossan, made something for our log!

151
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,810
The log is the only thing on which one can nothing make.

152
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,540
Naaamiii-Saann!

153
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,980
Vivi-Chaaannn!

154
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,090
He you, balls!

155
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,940
Yo Sanji!

156
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,100
Isn't everyone is well?

157
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,440
I am so content!

158
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,760
This cretin never showed himself to help us,

159
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,260
and it has the base to be shown now?

160
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,940
What is it that?

161
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,290
Es you Mr. 3?

162
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,000
Do He, how you know for Mr. 3?

163
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,420
Ouahou! Nami-San!

164
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,740
You are always also stimulative!

165
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,830
You want to burst?

166
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,900
Eh well Nami-San.

167
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,550
You will catch cold like that.

168
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,650
Hold, mets that.

169
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,380
Thank you.

170
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,160
Eh well, I have just discussed with Mr. 0 on Den Den Mushi.

171
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,280
The Boss? You spoke to him?

172
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,180
Yes.

173
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,700
There was this species of odd hut in the middle of the jungle.

174
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,680
It would be said that it confused me with Mr. 3.

175
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,770
Therefore, I played the game and I said to him that I had killed you.

176
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,200
Isn't Ca wants to say that he believes us dead?

177
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,230
Why one can leave when nobody does not seek us?

178
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,420
One cannot leave?

179
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,140
There is something to make still here?

180
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,580
And after, I left myself the troubles to bring this to you.

181
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,790
What?

182
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,170
It is a eternal poses for Arabasta!

183
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,490
One can sail!

184
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,500
Allons-y, Capitaine !

185
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,730
Thank you very much Sanji-Kun!

186
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,040
During one moment, I believed that all was lost!

187
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,960
No the problem!! It is nothing!!

188
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,250
If I had known that you would be so content…

189
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,030
Yosh! Everyone!

190
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,090
Senbei party!

191
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,070
Doesn't Ca go Luffy?

192
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,750
One cannot make of Senbei party, it remains about it only three!

193
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,660
What?

194
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,800
In any event, there are not time for that!

195
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,400
Allons-y, Capitaine!

196
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,030
There are not time to lose here!

197
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,610
Zoro, He dumb!

198
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,340
You our contest of hunting, isn't this did not forget?

199
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,250
Not. And I gained, moreover.

200
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,670
I had a large rhino like that.

201
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,080
A rhino?

202
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,200
It may find it beneficial to be edible.

203
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,520
Of course.

204
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,310
A contest of hunting?

205
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,230
A contest of hunting?

206
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,560
Ca points out something to me.

207
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,920
Well, large-Ossan and large-Ossan.

208
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,120
One must go there!

209
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,190
I see.

210
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,610
You have the air in a hurry.

211
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,990
It is damage which you donot can remain with us.

212
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,260
I hope that your country is healthy and except.

213
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,880
Yes, thank you!

214
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,650
With more!

215
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,640
Do not die any more!

216
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,560
One day, I will go in Elbaf!

217
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,470
Wait to see it.
Mine is really larger.

218
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,100
Ben yes, of course.

219
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,400
I will be a honest warrior of the seas!

220
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,440
Our friends from go away.

221
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,030
Yes.

222
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,700
We cannot let them leave like that.

223
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,160
This monster always lives in the sea of the west.

224
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,980
Is Dorry, how your wound?

225
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,560
Eh well… I will not die about it.

226
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,190
My axe and your sword soon will reach their limit.

227
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,520
You are sad?

228
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,050
Yes, I am it.

229
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,690
I fought with this axe during 100 years.

230
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,690
But…

231
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,300
For these small human, I will not regret it.

232
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,110
Therefore, it is decided!

233
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,080
Look by yourself!
Mine is larger!

234
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,660
But looks at!
My lizard gains!

235
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,040
Do your eyes have a problem or what?

236
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,920
My rhino is much larger!

237
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,710
Who is concerned with it? Both have the air goods.

238
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,250
Your mouth, moron!!

239
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,250
Your mouth moron!!

240
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,670
Look at them!

241
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,980
The tien is not also large!

242
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,750
The tien is not also long!

243
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,410
Mine has much more meat!

244
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,370
This meat is dégueu!

245
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,960
Bastard, it is not true!

246
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,300
Until when you will continue?

247
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,660
It is not as if one of both could hold on the boat.

248
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,350
Cut right that which one needs. We are ready to leave.

249
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Yes, Nami-San!

250
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,700
He Usopp!
You you can see that I gained, not true?

251
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,580
Hein, I of insane.

252
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,240
Can't you say that there is equality?

253
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,500
There is no equality in a match.

254
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,440
And you dispatch go up!

255
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,340
Yes!

256
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,640
All sails outside!

257
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,860
They said that if one continues by there, one arrives on the western face of the island.

258
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,630
Didn't He, one can have taken more meat?

259
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,560
Cretin, if one takes some more, it will be rotted before it is eaten!

260
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,310
Do you try to make run the boat?

261
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,750
Oh, giants-Ossan!

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,640
They came for our departure!

263
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,140
For all the small human ones which came on this island,

264
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,280
the imperative reason for which they did not reach the following island is in front of us.

265
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,530
You took care on our lives with honor.

266
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,260
And thus, we must make similar,
whatever the enemy who presents himself.

267
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,480
The honor of a friend should be tarnished at no price.

268
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,240
Trust us and continue right in front!

269
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,670
Whatever what appears, do not change a trajectory!

270
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,500
Of agreement!

271
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,770
What is there?

272
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,240
What did you include/understand?

273
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,050
One goes straight no matter what it arrives!

274
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,040
It is one goodbye.

275
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,110
We will be re-examined.

276
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,120
Without any doubt.

277
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,710
Look at that! In front of!

278
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,990
Therefore, you appeared, Mangeur of islands.

279
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,010
We will force you to let them pass,

280
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,010
on the name of Elbaf!

281
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,390
What is it that?

282
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,740
It is what that?

283
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,940
A poisson rouge?

284
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,470
A giant poisson rouge?

285
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,950
Where had I already heard of that?

286
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,950
Turn the rudder!
Quickly or we will be swallowed!

287
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,440
Usopp, hurries!

288
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,870
I cannot!

289
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,550
One sinks right in front!

290
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,780
Isn't this, Luffy?

291
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,120
You bet?

292
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,650
You are insane?

293
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,360
This thing is not like Laboon!

294
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,780
I know.

295
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,880
Calm yourself.

296
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,590
Hold, take the Senbei last!

297
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,820
I do not want any!

298
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,250
One must make half-turn!

299
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,330
We all will be…

300
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,250
Nami, stops.

301
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,630
Luffy!

302
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,030
One these guys, isn't this can trust?

303
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,770
Yes.

304
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,960
Really?

305
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,360
We really will direct we right towards the interior of this monster?

306
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,840
It is too late! One cannot stop any more!

307
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,660
Eh well, you grew well, Mangeur of islands.

308
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,790
Monstrous Poisson rouge!

309
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,110
It is not only its size which is surprising.

310
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,080
There are also the size and the enormous length of the “islands” which it lays after having eaten,

311
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,060
like this called giant shit Nanimonai Island.

312
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,700
I remember when we landed on one of these things by thinking that it was a continent.

313
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,810
Last happy days of our adventures.

314
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,880
To look at points out these days to me.

315
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,410
Only the snake with the tasks of blood we cannot bore!

316
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,640
Contemplate strongest of the axes of the tribe of the giant warriors of Elbaf!

317
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,190
Straight! Straight!

318
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,230
What do you say?

319
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,030
One was already eaten!

320
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,610
Straight! Straight!

321
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,080
Hakoku!!

322
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,080
Hakoku = the nation of the warriors

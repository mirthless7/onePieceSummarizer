1
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:07,540
Zenny lives on the island of the goat

2
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:07,540
There is a pirate boat
on the mountain!

3
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,460
Follow them!!! Do not let them flee!!!

4
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,610
I was unaware of at which point these pirates were dangerous.

5
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,760
But look at how they escape.

6
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,780
Sergeant!

7
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,800
One will capture the crew of the “Straw hat”.

8
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,710
I cross which one will be able them to have.

9
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,350
Hey! …
If nothing is done they will catch up with us!

10
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,350
I am hungry!

11
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,780
Me also…

12
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,880
Does the navy thus release never taken?

13
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,760
You did not can anything catch?

14
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,410
It is not a question of being able to catch something or not, but one moves too quickly.

15
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,840
This rate/rhythm, we will be dehydrated or died of hunger.

16
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,960
Robin-chan,

17
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,690
Your tea of the afternoon.

18
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,860
And in no-claims bonus delicious milfoils.

19
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,590
Thank you, Cooker-san.

20
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,760
[Cooker-san:Cook]

21
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,950
I want me too.

22
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,950
Where you hid that, brothel!!!

23
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,030
Hey! Remove your dirty legs from there, cretins.

24
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,040
I want me too!

25
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,940
How can you have fun in this situation.

26
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,540
It is not the moment to laugh!!

27
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,190
Nami! I cross which one will have to more worry about this that navy.

28
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,030
You would make better take the bar!

29
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,510
You ace not to say that to me.

30
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,970
Still fog?

31
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,240
Perhaps will be able we to use this fog in our favor and to mislead the navy.

32
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,370
But… These currents are too fast…
And of many rocks are submerged.

33
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,080
At this place, the sea represents an imminent danger to the fleet.

34
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,600
One cannot advance any more!

35
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,660
We are likely to pass there.

36
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,660
Keep silent yourself!

37
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,720
We continued them all this way up to now! We are close!

38
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,720
Sergeant, we must…

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,430
We withdraw ourselves. Let us make half-turn.

40
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,540
But we received direct orders of the Moore captain…

41
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,230
… imperatively to capture and eliminate the crew from the “Straw hat”!

42
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,220
Keep silent yourself, species of idiot!

43
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,290
The Captain is not charges some here.
But am months I there, measuring rod?

44
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,190
Yes, Mister!

45
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,940
Right in front of at any speed!!
Draw the principal sail on the left!!

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,350
We exceeded the fog.

47
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,810
Ohh!! An island! I see an island!

48
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,150
Perhaps that there is something to puff out!

49
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,640
Six people and an animal!

50
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,290
You do not have any chance, doubles of pirates.

51
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,710
You will see what I reserve to you!

52
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,290
Perhaps isn't this inhabited?

53
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,210
A goat?

54
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,910
Vian…!!!

55
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,660
Meat, meat, meat…

56
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,660
Viaaaaaaande

57
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,520
Stop immediately!

58
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Even if you are hungry, you cannot eat this poor small goat!

59
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,950
It would be said that the friends of your pretty small goat
we surrounded.

60
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,070
It is a trap!

61
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,330
It led us in a trap!

62
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,570
I cross which one does not have the choice.

63
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,920
Does not kill them, Zoro!

64
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,320
They are not also bad.
I can ensure it to you.

65
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,570
CAT ko20} SHI

66
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,390
This goat deviated the trajectory.

67
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,190
Wait! One is not here to eat you.
I swear it to you!

68
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,780
But, why did you lead us in this trap?

69
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,150
Eh? Did somebody order to you to do it!?

70
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,620
Who?

71
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,780
Stop!

72
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,610
Idiot! Draw from there!

73
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,690
They is dangerous…

74
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,350
Arrêteeeeeeeeez!!!!!!!

75
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,480
M… Monster!!!

76
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,250
A strange grandfather fell from the tree.

77
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,810
Is Chopper, him it guy who asked the goats to attack us?

78
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,940
Good?

79
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,430
They say that it is him…

80
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,980
He probably believed that one was going to attack it…

81
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,570
Do not fear anything. We need simply a little water and food.

82
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,270
I cannot believe the words of a pirate!

83
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,030
Let to me say to you that there is no treasure on this island! I am mown.

84
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,080
You do not have the air of a guy who has much money in any case.

85
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,680
Dirty pirates!!

86
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,430
I remain a man despite everything!

87
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,780
You can boil me and burn me if you want!

88
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,740
Is Oh, it true?
I am the cook.

89
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,540
To boil and burn it are what I can do best.

90
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,840
Wait! Wait.

91
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,230
I joked!
Devils! Traitors! Assassins!

92
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,910
He disappeared.

93
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,480
This capricious grandfather is really timorous…

94
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,330
Oh not! Its heart stopped!

95
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:50,910
Zoro!

96
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,260
Demon!

97
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,060
What a horror!

98
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,770
Marimo!

99
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,290
Meeeh!…

100
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,370
Wait! I do not have…!

101
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,250
I am doctor.

102
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,620
Show us the house of the old man.

103
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,520
I believed that I was going to die.

104
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,550
Is never necessary to lower its guard vis-a-vis pirates.

105
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,570
Keep silent yourself!
You disappeared all alone.

106
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,660
Did Ossan, your heart stop because to you stays frightened?

107
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,360
On Large Line, one is not with the shelter of the surprises.

108
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,010
How are you managed to survive with such a fragile heart.

109
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,380
Ouai, It is true!

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,650
Lastly, what a relief!!
You do not have anything low register.

111
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,780
Which relief??

112
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,440
Following this incident, which is entirely of your fault.

113
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,910
I must rest a little after having come very close to death.
I will be able neither to cut wood, nor to extract from water.

114
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,760
It is a great failure for me!
You must compensate me for at least 50 million berrys!

115
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,460
Aren't you over-estimating?
Ca should not exceed that.

116
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,290
It is too severe. Even if I am generous, that must at least do that.

117
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,470
After deduction of the expenses of medical intervention of Chopper, that must do that.

118
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,870
These jeunes gens misuses a poor old man like vultures…

119
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,540
They are tyrants!

120
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,590
How if they planned to kill me!

121
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
One does not try to tyrannize you…

122
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,340
I want to live a long life…

123
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,970
Do not cry please!

124
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,950
They is good, Ossan. One will help you to cut wood and to extract from water…

125
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,500
Mugiwara-nii-chan, you include/understand me!

126
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,850
Ca solves the problem.

127
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,740
This insane old man seems to hate the pirates.

128
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,370
Perhaps he has his reasons.

129
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,380
The goats say that it is the only human being on this island.

130
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,840
It has failed here, and lives with them for 20 years.

131
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,150
20 years? One already met somebody of similar.

132
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,370
Where is what you go, Zoro?

133
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,760
I will seek food.

134
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,280
I doubt that this old rascal wants to divide something with us.

135
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,480
Ok!! Do not forget especially to bring back meat!

136
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,280
Do not force me has to strike you…

137
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,370
Let us see seeing!!

138
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,600
Move back a little behind. The young people nowadays do not appreciate art to cut out wood.

139
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,950
And they do not pigent anything with cleaning.

140
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,600
Remake to me that!

141
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,750
After you will give to eat with the goats. And do not forget to repair my hat.

142
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,760
Ah, I am burst.

143
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,460
Stop trailing and come to make me massages.
I must all say to you to you the young people.

144
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,630
You cause me too many problems.

145
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,670
And now…

146
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,970
Still!?

147
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,700
Shit!! It is by where north?
It is where the south?

148
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,060
What?

149
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,830
It is…

150
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,960
Finally of return…

151
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,650
You did not finish any yet with that?

152
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,110
This old man does not stop giving us his drudgeries has to make.

153
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,930
I am exhausted.

154
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
Ehh, I am hungry!

155
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,320
A pirate boat?

156
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,510
It was in rather bad condition, but y' had a flag pirates above.

157
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,180
Who built it?

158
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,220
Ca must be this old rascal.

159
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,830
And why would it have builds a pirate boat?

160
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,170
Who is concerned with it?

161
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,690
Can be that one discovered something of interesting.

162
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,840
Let us throw a glance there…
At the top of this mountain, not?

163
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,660
Allons-y !

164
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,420
Hey, not the sorrow to run.

165
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,790
Wait, that takes much time to go there!

166
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,140
It was right!

167
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,250
Brothel, It is really very close if one goes straight.

168
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,410
Ca appears unfinished.

169
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,380
Like a ghost ship on the mountain.

170
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,600
Robin, does not say similar things.

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,450
It is what?

172
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,320
Do not eat me, I am still too young person!

173
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,760
They are only fireflies!

174
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,260
He used trees as timber.

175
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,320
But it would be said that it stopped suddenly.

176
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,720
Is this really this insane old man who built that?

177
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,930
I believe that it is not here.

178
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,070
What is what is not here, Nami?

179
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,330
The treasure!

180
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,630
Treasury?

181
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,400
My instinct says to me that this old man is really…

182
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,670
A former pirate who tries to hide something!

183
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,060
Pirate?

184
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,040
I bet that it made shipwreck and failed only on this island.

185
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,350
And to escape from this island it started to build this boat.

186
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,990
But a former pirate hating the pirates?
Ca does not have any direction, see!

187
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,150
It is simply a camouflage, as that one will not seek his hidden treasure.

188
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,410
I found it equivocal as soon as I threw a glance on what it had.

189
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,010
Remember these valuable articles in the hut of the old man.

190
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,410
According to me it was a very beautiful collection.

191
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,620
Oh Nami-san, it was brilliant!

192
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,630
You laugh. This old very timid man cannot be a pirate.

193
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,180
He east can be old famous pirate,
In any event, look at this boat!

194
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,660
There is no way open in front of…

195
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,110
And behind, there is only one cliff impossible to climb.

196
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,970
If were to escape, why build it at the top of a mountain?

197
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,030
Why, Nami?
Why, Nami-san.

198
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,540
Ben…!!

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,370
Why did you withdraw yourselves?
Dangerous sea?

200
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,280
Is what you believe that you can make reign the justice of the Navy by being afraid of something like that?

201
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,850
All my excuses.

202
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,800
I thought simply that these pirates would also find this area dangerous for navigation.

203
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,280
Our game is not yet escaped.

204
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,470
Smoker and the Squadron of the Black Lance of Hina failed their mission of eliminating the pirates from the “Straw hat”.

205
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,140
But I will crush them my own hands.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,360
Captain, I do not think that one can have them also easily.

207
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,060
Organize a team of attack immediately!

208
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,910
Locate and eliminate the crew from the “Straw hat”.

209
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,970
Yes Mister!

210
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,500
Excuse to me captain…

211
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,630
Allons-y Caporal…

212
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,640
Yes, Mister.

213
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,070
Why didn't you inform the captain in connection with the island?

214
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,480
You saw it?

215
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,560
Yes, among this water, I saw an unexplored island of my own eyes.

216
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,190
Doesn't the captain owe the knowledge, included/understood?

217
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,680
Why?
The Straw hat east can be on this island!

218
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,270
I will tell you a small secrecy.

219
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,810
On Arabasta, which was this person who stopped Crocodile?

220
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,630
Dear Sir, it was the Smoker captain!
A large hero in the Navy!

221
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,790
I cross although it deserves a medal.
But it was right a cover.

222
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,520
But, which will be able of…?

223
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,900
Apparently, it was Straw hat.

224
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,820
If one faces types like them, we will never have enough men.

225
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,690
But…

226
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,530
Hey, does not take always also seriously what your superiors say.

227
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,280
If one tries to face them of face, they will have us in a wink.

228
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,990
But in this moment, there is a thing for which I need your assistance, Caporal.

229
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
My assistance?

230
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,660
Hey, let us foutons the camps of this island.

231
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,640
If one remains here, this idiot will make us work for him for eternity.

232
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,070
Above all, I said…

233
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,330
Luffy!

234
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,370
I am hungry!

235
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,770
It is not sufficient to hold me upright!

236
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,600
What, y' has some more!

237
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,090
Very well, let us join the boat.

238
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,000
You ace very eaten when we turned you the back

239
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,580
Ah Chopper! One turns over to the boat.

240
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,620
I will remain with the old man.
I cannot drop my patient.

241
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,470
He goes well now.
You will never finish any if you feel sorry for him.

242
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,620
It is finished soon.

243
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,630
What?

244
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,510
Finished?

245
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,520
Its heart did not stop simply because it was frightened.

246
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,930
It is sick.

247
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,220
Finished? You want to say…

248
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,380
I am sure, it has less than three days to live.

249
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,710
What?

250
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,280
Three days?

251
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,710
I slept well.

252
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,600
Ca feels good!!

253
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,960
Hello Ojii-chan.

254
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,050
Your breakfast awaits you.

255
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,210
It is what all that?

256
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,810
Sanji is a large cook!
They is delicious!

257
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,190
The goats showed us some places where one could fish and collect food.

258
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,070
Now, go ahead and tastes!

259
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
I warn you, Nami.
I will not give you a round for that!

260
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,370
Do not worry you for that.

261
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,860
Incredible!! It is difficult to believe.

262
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,180
I had intended to say:“Be wary of the pirates who become suddenly friendly”.

263
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,780
There must be poison inside.

264
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,130
Species of impolite idiot.

265
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,110
To deal with doesn't the old people have anything strange, not?

266
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,520
Good, if you do not want any, I eat it!

267
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,000
, I wait eat it, I eat it!

268
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,290
Be to you which, you?

269
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,810
Are Jii-San, you well?

270
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,870
Does not frighten it!

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,710
Afflicted.

272
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,410
Thus you ate a fruit of demon.

273
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,450
It delicious, that is done well a long time that I had not eaten anything of also good!

274
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,600
Ojii-chan, has there T it another thing which we can make for you.

275
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,920
Thus you will not leave anything unfinished.

276
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,440
Firm your mouth cretin!

277
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,810
If you like my kitchen, I will prepare you dishes when you want.

278
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,750
Really? Thank you!
Ouiii, they is very good…

279
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,720
They is so good!

280
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,890
What does not go, Ossan!

281
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,760
It is not possible.

282
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,940
Already?

283
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,440
Not!!

284
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,220
Hey, does not give up now!

285
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,730
They is really good!
I was so surprised that had been wedged in my throat!

286
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,360
What, food was simply wedged in your throat?

287
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
Do not frighten us thus any more.

288
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,890
I knew that it was a little too early.

289
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,740
Too much early why?

290
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,570
C….it is nothing!!
He wanted to say that you eat too quickly.

291
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,580
But, you can take mine!

292
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,960
Mine too!

293
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,080
Also take that…

294
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,560
It is true?
Thank you!! Thank you!!

295
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,360
All is quite good…

296
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,460
This appetite… that points out Luffy to me!!

297
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,630
Will he really die in three days?

298
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,930
I found, Sergent.

299
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,340
According to this report/ratio, 20 years ago…

300
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,200
… a man on board a pirate boat disappeared in this water!

301
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,490
Now I remember, its name was Zenny or something like that.

302
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,450
Zenny?

303
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,190
It had not completely disappeared!
It was there with its large treasure.

304
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:36,550
If it made shipwreck on this island…
… It should be ready to pass the weapon on the left.

305
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,360
But the treasures never die.

306
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,680
Hey, You eat too much!

307
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,700
I have just started…

308
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,960
You are too cool, Ossan…

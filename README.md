Project for Knight Hacks VI Hackathon 2023. Python-based project that summarizes the plot of the Japanese animated series One Piece from a text file. One Piece is the current longest anime, consisting of over one thousand episodes and taking over seventeen consecutive days to watch fully. Using this program would allow the user to save time and start watching more current One Piece episodes in a shorter period of time. It allows the user to choose which episodes they would like to know the plot of but is best used with under 100 episodes at a time.

Makes use of Spacy library.
